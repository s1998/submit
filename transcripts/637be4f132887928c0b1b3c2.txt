So it it it connects to your meetings to join zoom many you can see it here it says meeting audio. So that's That's what it is. That's number one. Number two, since gold the meeting and transcribe it We also show you your recordings. So you have a page where you can see your meeting history and if familiar with Gong, I've used gong.

Client 4: Yeah. We don't use gong good today at this this one, but I've you gonna touch.

You can see the transcript you can see how much time you spent talking, and it will coach you basically. It'll tell you like, hey, like we recommend you these all that be. How's does that sound?

Client 4: Sounds good Right.

Host 1: Which just like curiosity, which of these two value props is resonating with you most right Well, I mean, for this organization, we're not you know, both actually really help because we're not doing either yet.

Client 4: The ability to update Salesforce definitely seats you know helps. Reduce time and workflow. Primarily, but even just being able to and get the the meetings that we're we're talking about that can be quite technical sometimes will be super valuable. And what we're doing it... And just being able to share those even across the team is value.

Host 1: Yeah. So you can share those with the team and you can share that with the client. The customer. Right? Like, if you go a lot of stuff in like, hey, it's zero thing we talked out like an Ai and until and so forth. Awesome. So can you go ahead and show your screen And I will go ahead and send you the second plane here. In the chat. He to it with you if i recall my screen. Well, I guess it's solely recording in a way.

Host 1: Thank you. Okay. So do you use Google or Microsoft?

Client 4: But this one will use Microsoft.

Host 1: Got it You guys. You can feel free to go ahead and... Yeah. So we exactly. So we connect to your calendar during to your sales meetings. But I'm sorry. I do writing. Can you you bring the app has been on on what you're doing what your company does.

Client 4: Yeah. So airline metrics is a an analytical tool for the travel industry specifically for travel agencies airlines and corporates that have travel programs. What we do is we track all of the air specific data flown in revenue you know, say for example, when you buy a ticket, you buy a ticket, but you don't use it right away. Right? It's not used to later. So tracking that ticket from the time it's purchased till the time it's used, we give insights for those different groups. To what's happening within their airline revenue. And we track those against their targets. So they... They're giving sales targets for that they need to hit in order to get incentives and playback back and things like that. So we track those contracts for them, they always know where they stand and then we forecast that information so that they know where they'll be. Even though they're not there yet. So sometimes it's three months before you actually use a ticket that you purchased. So you need to know what you're actually setting.

Host 1: Let makes sense And and having is the company in having is you What what do you do there?

Client 4: Yeah. So I am there chief commercial Officer.
