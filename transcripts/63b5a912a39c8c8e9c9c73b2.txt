Client 1: everyone. How are you all doing?

Host 2: A good in.

Client 1: Good.

Client 1: The pleasure you're speaking with you Yes.

Host 2: Absolutely. Great to meet you. Are we going to wait for S?

Client 1: Yeah. Let's... I think either one of s or Colombo should be joining us.

Host 2: Alright.

Client 1: Now are you based in Miami?

Host 2: I am... I I usually am, but right now I'm calling from a Paris.

Client 1: Nice. Payments.

Host 2: Here for the for the holidays days.

Client 1: Yeah. Cool. I'm I'm in Tampa, but my parents are in Sunny isles. In miami, like north miami me?

Host 2: Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I moved I moved to my about a year ago. It's it's pretty awesome. You get use to to the weather.

Client 1: Oh my god. We just went to Scotland because my wife's ben from there. And going from zero celsius going from zero to, like, twenty eight is like you know, a different world. It's like incredible. You you don't realize how much it impacts your they're like, you know, feelings and and all that.

Host 2: Yeah. And I I grew up in paris where it's always cooled obviously. And and now, you know, dig stuff. Like, even North california is too is to cold for.

Client 1: Oh my god. I'm I grew in New York. Same thing. You know, I was used to, like negative five negative six I come to miami and I'm my oh my god. It's ten today. So so cold. You know, like, I I need to wear a snow code.

Host 2: Right. Alright. I see I see a S here at let's type right, because I do have a all stuff at the twenty five. Alright. So quick round of intro flow under and Ceo of tim flow. We are currently working on sales ai, which is... You can see here, like Brendan meeting recorder. I'm also being good at ian in So kind of like gong like a conversation intelligence solution it aims to help sales teams become more efficient basically and and, you know, sales details to coach teams and swollen were forth and extracting insights from their calls and so and forth. This is yeah. I I can you cell.

Host 3: Hey. Yeah. I'm engineer Enrique team and working on sales out in the. I'm in London in the Uk so I love my family this actually from Scotland and I never. And I I think easier.

Host 3: Could been a little worse than zero.

Client 1: Yep. Question I meet you. I'll just quickly go since I was speaking to you both the Sam gold build senior sales engineer here. They're helping with the technical stuff. Of Deepgram I'll let charlene Colombo.

Client 4: Good morning, S Ba Coo for Deepgram. Part of the friends and family of the team flow group. So you yes for having us.

Host 2: Great. Totally. Alright. Let me catch you up on the issues that we're having here. So can you see my screen here?

Client 4: Yes.

Host 2: So this is Cell Ai. So the the the idea again, is straightforward i can see here my meeting recordings. And let me take a good example here, I believe if this this is going to be a fine one. And so I can click on any meeting. I can look at the recording This depends how many workspaces. This is a transcript generated by Deepgram And here, I can I can I can see a summary that basically we feeds these transcript to Dvd three. We generate the summary from of the meeting. And then, you know, the user can actually duck to an Ai about conversation like, hey, let know, what is it schools solution bad? Like, what was the outcome installment in so forth? What we are discovering is that the the trent quality... We're having issues with the transcript quality. Especially, I i I suspect that other that actually due to my accent. I think I think it's struggling quite a bit with accents. And I'm looking for like login pulling in that because this is actually the the best. Mh. Perhaps these Yeah. I think even even with American accents it's very often as struggling. So And the problem is that again, we... We are fitting that to Ai instead of like garbage and get garbage out. And so as a result of this, you know, the the summaries is bad, like, the the the Ai chat is bad so on and so forth. So yeah, just wait to see if you had any suggestions on how to get better their results. Yeah.

Client 1: So you know, first of all, what we always wanna do is is just take a scientific approach if you can the audio if you can combine provide the corresponding transcripts. Information is helpful to us to understand exactly what's going wrong. Right? When you say something like you know, they're they're not great on my accent. Right? What does that mean? Is it not picking of any words. Picking up some words. Is it missing specific words? Right? So so identifying exactly what's going wrong. Is going to be the first step that we're gonna wanna take. The second step we're gonna wanna take is if this is something that we can pick up very quickly through model training. Basically, what we would do is we would take some representative audio what's in your accent, which I understand probably we not represent but everyone using Sales dot ai. But we just get data from it. We normalize against just a general set of audio, meaning all audio, all human voice is but we train on some of yours. We can improve on your specific accent and then give you a model that's generally, so you don't get negative you know, accuracy against our base model. But we also improved greatly the accuracy specifically on your sent or others like yours. Does that make sense?

Host 2: Yeah. The problem is that obviously, we're not be able to do for reasonable customer and and would rather avoid having to go through entire training room. Even if we could we'd rather avoid throwing a away to feel two meetings because like, that's why like, the the impression of the meaning of the of the of the product is is fooled. This is another example let me mean. So just just to right. To characterize very clearly. Is issue again. So... yeah it basically... Oh, Guys... Yeah. I spent like a semester in france long ago in mobile. So... But I wanna go to everything restrictions. Okay. What what were are doing called that? Physics, I was a physics researchers. So it was my there. Just semester. Oh, wow. Nice right. So here it's it's like message reading the Nice It's... It he also has an accent, which i think is the other issue that he's got like a Russian accent, but it's it's basically, I think more than half the world all incorrect. I don't know last. Right. Just... Yeah. So... Yeah, That... That's the issue we're having here. So is there any solution here. About like, we're retraining the mobile on like can you license.

Client 1: So so there's two things here. Right? Because what you're pointing out is that the words are distributed incorrectly to the speaker. Which i deem is different than the words being incorrect. Right?

Client 1: So which you were discussing Go ahead.

Host 2: That does both issues.

Host 3: I think the are incorrect as well. Like if you look... At Soogrim does deal last year, on the screen. I think I said I moved here last year, so it's quite different on its she coming back described.

Host 2: My is very.

Host 2: That's here. I it used to be the Bay area app night who does heal last here.

Client 1: Okay. Yeah. So I think you know, the the first thing is if these our multi channel recordings, which I don't know what they are. You can actually separate based on channel and then you're essentially going to have this as a perfect separation. Because everyone every everywhere that, like, flow says will be a transcript dedicated to flow in word that sergei says will be a transcript dedicated to Sergei. So That's another approach if you do have channel separated audio. Otherwise, dia is doing its best to essentially assign the speakers and that's maybe a little bit different than explicitly just the words being wrong. That's more of a dia and then I'd kind of ask you more questions than that route. In terms of the accuracy, I know it's not ideal for me to suggest a model train, and I wouldn't expect that we would want to retrain for every single customer. But maybe some initial training just based on your meetings, the subject context of your meetings. We're not just training on your accents. We're also training on the audio context and the specific things being spoken here. So the conversations that you're going to be having are going to be different in the conversations that know call center might be having or equivalent. Right? Because they're more sales focused. The other thing is we just have to understand which parameters you're using though I believe you're using the model. So that shouldn't be you know, a blocker in terms of you getting our best accuracy. Are using, you know, enhanced phone call or in enhanced general? Can you share maybe more about that?

Host 2: I'm believe using enhanced General Know? Yeah.

Host 3: Sorry. It was muted. Yeah. I think were using it in enhanced we're using some something think it's in not general. And I think we're using some enhanced dia sterilization as well. Potentially Okay.

Client 1: If you can just confirm that, maybe try being enhanced phone call as well. I these are more kind of like, phone call meetings. That's that's under avenue you can take that might be a better model.

Host 3: Separately. Agent they come from video conferencing like Zoom Google meet.

Host 3: But I think those are the main two so with that what phone call applied to that or It like, don't know how literally is the phone call thing, but i don't think.

Host 3: It's more little will band audio.

Client 1: Not specific explicitly phone call, It's more just aligned to low band. So you know, I don't know how you're pulling the recordings, but if they are, like, hey k Hey eight thousand kilohertz. Then, you know, that might be something where the phone come on might be more performant.

Host 2: Doesn't sound like recording to me.

Client 1: Does it? Yeah.

Client 1: From from this. This one does.

Host 2: So... Okay. So check, please recall with the recordings or h k. I think should also check with. we can have channel based recordings like multi channel recordings.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 1: Those those are two big outs to start with. And then I'd also just ask, you know, again, I wouldn't necessarily recommend you do model for every single customer though you might want to do strategic ones, especially if you have, like, a large customer a large portion of revenue or whatever. Models tend to perform very well. Because you're training on their specific context verbiage terminology spellings, etcetera. Sound environment acoustic environment. What I might suggest though is just a small pre model train. Just so you can see for yourself based on your audio, and your representative conversations. We can whip one up that's, you know, not broader than maybe this more specific use case, if it seems like this is more interview type conversations you know, we we could train on that and and you would probably see a pretty significant improvement based on being more inclusive of this specific accents and the specific terminology being discussed in these conversations.

Host 3: It's training with we need a transcript that's been corrected. If there any missing words and anything done that.

Client 1: Yeah. Great question. No. You would just provide us the audio. So it would just be representative audio. So, you know, this is an example. You know, audio that you'd be running the meeting software on you would pull this audio file or video just the original one that we wouldn't want you to compress it or change it in any way because essentially, what we're training on is also what we're going to be improving on So I would say, you know, ten and least hours it's a representative audio, if you can provide twenty, that'd be much much better. We will do the labeling and output the model to you. That is let's say a model equals steam flow. And then you wouldn't even have to worry about, you know, phone call or general because we basically validate that on our end, make sure we identify which one is more performing. And then output a model to you. That is just model equals team flow tier equals hands. That kind of takes care of all of that altogether and is better on the a big accents and terminology that you discuss.

Host 2: But again I I don't assume that this would transfer this kind of like the holmes games which transfer to other customers with it So it it does depend right?

Client 1: If your other customers having some more conversations to this or some more accents, then it very much would transfer because it's training on not just, you know, your accent, but the features of your accent, the acoustic environment of your accent, the terminology of your accent.

Client 1: Don't think I don't think they are having similar positions neither on the accent on the topic.

Host 2: And and I I think you're also having, like, issues with use the transcriptions as well.

Client 1: Okay.

Host 2: I mean, you wanna send us representative audio from them could train model specifically for the customer as well.

Client 1: Right? And and again, I'm not saying the Jet for every single customer, but getting a baseline of some amount of hours of trouble audio. And don't just buy as towards the trouble audio also give us stuff that maybe we also do quite well out because we wanna just get a baseline of here's the type of things that are discussed here the type of accents involved here as the type of room environment or acoustic environment, Right? Is it two speakers is the four speakers six speakers. All of that data goes in and we output a model for you. That is, you know, more bias towards getting that information correctly.

Host 2: Have a dumb question. Jot thomas from Loom is is an investor employee. He was telling me that they were experimenting quite a bit right now on Based transcription and they're having extraordinary results based on that. Like, this is, like, blue up, like, all of their benchmarks. Is that something that Deepgram is is currently to looking at?

Client 1: Yeah. We've looked at Wi, Soogrim our Ceo as a big blog about it. Broadly speaking, there's a few different thoughts with Whisper. And, you know, I I could get into it if it's relevant to you here, but We looked at it and based on our findings we found that we out performant on the number of benchmarks? The other thing that Was doesn't have going for it? Is real time transcription, which it doesn't currently do. Whisper does not have timestamps stamps. Might make some of your transcript logic a little bit more difficult. And whisper is also much slower. So you we noticed in running Deepgram it outputs the results very quickly whereas Whisper takes bit of time longer. And all that's based on the approach. So we've kind patented our approach. Has been proven to be a lot more computer efficient and has a lot of other benefits i again, to the approach that we've taken.

Host 2: How much slower we superior because In our case, you know, I i I actually think holy is are lot more important in in speed. For now, at least yeah.

Client 1: Yeah. I'm absolutely. Here is the blog post chat. It has information about the speed about the accuracy, about the different models, we tested to all five models, the tiny the base small the medium in the orange. And the speeds as well. Relative each model.

Client 5: One one thing to add is that our research team actually has worked on getting with spur into our system and also supporting the features that we have. So, like, the if if you were to download Whisper off the shelf right now, you wouldn't get timestamps stamps and and features that work with Deepgram essentially. We are working to make that available to customers and that should be ready and January, maybe even as soon as next week, So some datasets sets we actually have seen the Whisper out performs our models Sam said on others and some of the internal benchmarks that we've done. We've outperformed them. Kinda depends on the dataset set. But we will have that option available and, like, fully featured for our customers. There are some implications around the compute side of it. Like Sam as mentioned like, an hour you know, a thirty minute phone call for Deepgram would take like, fifteen, twenty seconds to return to you for for Whisper depending on the model that you're running it anywhere between, like, thirty minutes in a few hours. But if that's not a problem, you're getting better accuracy. And you want, like, the time stamps and other features like that. Like, you know, dia or multi channel to, like, just work as opposed to getting it off the shelf yourself. That's that's something that we could discuss probably relatively soon, have you be one of our early testers with that Yeah.

Host 2: I'd love... I left to at least like run own box on luis against, like, this this kind of transcript, for example, and and see the kind of results that we're getting. I'm wondering that would be workaround workarounds to the the timestamp issues for example, Like, maybe if you're running to like your own model, and then you use the timestamps for you from your model, but the transcripts from luis pure this is kind stuff Yeah.

Client 5: So the the work... Like, the the things we've been doing on our end is getting our like, feature set to to work with Whisper. So, like, what you get with Deepgram enhanced model, you would also get with Whisper in terms of, like, the time and other features that are supported. So that's been kind of the the lift of what the the research team has been doing, and then we gotta put it in production.

Host 2: And and when do you think they'll be available testing?

Client 5: As soon as next week as late as like, end of January, So pretty soon I I just have to say a put the bit out of that definitely.

Client 5: Okay. Sounds good. But we'll definitely let you know, like, right when something's released and and in production we'll we'll let you know.

Host 2: Sweet. Also. Okay. So i'll follow up in a week belt whisper and the the the bit of that model. Great. Anything else we So on our side, I think Yeah. We're going to send you a bunch of of our sensitive audio, I would love to get Like, that just model we mentioned. Think we also need to talk without ba because we don't do the recordings all sales. We we go through a partner that's called a recall. You might be have heard of him. And I I am another impression that they might be doing something wrong with quoting them I'm person to make... They might not do it like a multi general recording and it might do it like an k kind of recording. So like, we need we need to check with them what's going on here. Anything else we can do here.

Client 1: Offhand. You know I'd always recommend Just testing it out testing some of the other parameters.

Client 1: You mentioned you've only tested in general phone calls is a good shout as well. Recall, you know, that's probably a good place to start to figure out if the recording are changing in any way from, you know, initial to the recording you know, any type of compression you're doing is helpful as a reference point as well. And the model training is really going to be the one that's going to be the fat this you know, improvement that you're going to see. Because again, if we're training on the specific representative audio, we're going to improve significant on that audio. And middle yield up you know, pretty substantial improvement.

Host 2: Great. Awesome. Okay? Okay. So let me follow the email then with do list of of these action items. Will be able to to point on them So again, setting your representative audio and, you know, testing a few more parameters like playing around with with this, basically, and we can take it from there.

Client 1: Yes. Sounds great. Just quickly while I have you both Should we book time for next week to check in? Or, ian and are you planning on sending the audio I mean, should I just check with ian in a week? Like like, what's the best plan there?

Host 2: Yeah. How much we do that by email? What what do you think again?

Host 3: Yep. Should we just do that on the existing email for and then? We can because we'll go ask some questions do. Partner or about some of the things and and see how much audio we've got so far to give you training in the something.

Client 1: Sounds. Works. Yeah. So whenever you get that, send it over, I'll pull it down and send it to our research seem to make that model and then we deployed on model especially for you. So, like, only your project. So one the other things you might wanna look into giving me is the email that you're using the project Id that you're using Typically, we also segment access to models by the project Id, and you can invite members into the project So that's another thing that you might wanna think about is if you have like, an overarching team project make sure everyone that would be testing that model is in that project.

Host 3: Okay. So When you say everyone who be testing that model, Do you mean because we have a project Id and we use the Api api to send fully that. So you just mean that we're sending everything to that right, so there's to the same project.

Client 1: To that project. Yeah. You can make multiple Api keys. You can make multiple email accounts associated to one project, but we're going to give access to that model that we project Id.

Client 1: So just make sure that yeah. Anyone who who's testing it is part of that project Id. Yep. Cool Alright?

Host 2: Great. Okay. I'm following up then by email and we can take it from there.

Client 1: Sounds good. Meeting both. Thank you for their time.

Host 2: Thank you as well. See yep.

Host 3: Yep. Thank you. Is
