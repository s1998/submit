Client 2: just totally Yeah. Hi, how's it going?

Host 1: Really Good. Happy Monday.

Client 2: Happy Monday Yes. It feels like a happy one indeed my rock stars is giving you shout outs through and through.

Client 2: I'm rooting for shooting start of the quarter.

Client 3: Okay you know that Do you know shooting insurance?

Host 1: No. What is that entail Remember what we were the Visa, but it happened in the bar nuke canals the shooting star q three, was basically every...

Client 2: Every quarter, the whole team boats on the person that has embodied the orbit values the most.

Host 1: Mh Okay. And It was Penelope in queue three.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

Host 1: Yeah. That'd be cool That would be cool and deserved.

Client 2: But yeah, we talk we we'll see the whole team box. Let's see how demo day goes. Maybe maybe some of the engineers ago.

Client 2: Sway it. But it's.

Host 1: A lot of product things happening in December.

Client 2: Right? It's across the board. So all values. It's not delivery of one thing.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: So... Alright. Let's... Let's dive in lee. I think I might refer start with your pipeline first.

Client 2: Okay time Yeah.

Host 1: Sounds good all share my screen. So it's a lot of the things last week in terms of conversation being pushed. Right? Billy believe, maybe that's the same thing with you, even Galadriel, I don't know it's that's happening with, like, our current customers at all, maybe not since it's in a year, but There's a few key accounts that I i'm really hoping to push forward. Soon So I have a call with Yu. Today, is great, there they're coming back. Hopefully, that call goes really well. Have another call tomorrow with June learning. They're both out, like, Well, they're both had five figures So that's good the probably it's gonna range from ten to twenty k each it's a big question mark if they're gonna close in December. Right? I mean, who knows what's gonna happen with with budgets and priorities, but hoping we make a good offer where you know those two would be a really big one. the Dame is also at ten k. They're super excited they sent us no brainer. I still need to touch base with them. I touch base with champion last Friday, so she's still super engaged, but I need to get a follow with her and just to see where her heads up. I i'd love to close a couple this week even Il, I think or billy, I think you seen that email to Kin Academy today that I Now. They're on my list to send out that follow up. After this phone call in the afternoon. I didn't wanna do it too early, but maybe we can get them in a free trial by end of year, but they'll start signature, that'd be a pretty nice win. They at least expressed interest in that peter next up. It's essentially a thirty day. So that's a pretty high priority and in latitude. Latitude, A loop latitude, cavalry ventures, and then refresh miami. They're all at five k. Refresh miami is a nonprofit I gave, like, a ten percent discount and with their onboarding fee. They're all founders, investors. They're all the in the Vc startup space. So those are all you know, I think high potential, but they're all low value, but if they can sign sometime in December and start first thing next shared. I think that's a pretty nice possibility. And then i have a a lot, like, a couple handful alternate of other ones that could come in like pho state of mind ventures Text Boston is still in play, Ai fund, And who else is over here cal collab tory, I have a call him tomorrow. Five k, you know, Again, toss subs sp they're still in play for December. So we have some good momentum in terms of the pipeline.

Client 2: And the proposal contract they you all of these. There's, like contract outstanding for the ninety seven k. Ninety seven k.

Host 1: Yeah. So all of these... I mean, they're not all in dropbox sign. I think the only ones in dropbox sign are gonna be techs, no. Pho cavalry in latitude Right now, these are the... We only have fifteen k in dropbox sign, but all the rest actually have proposals like, through a dock or something like that. So they have a number and we're in gus we're we're talking on Should I send a dropbox as a next step?

Client 2: Okay.

Client 2: Yep. Amazing.

Host 1: And if I think At any moment, if I think they're not gonna close in December, I'm gonna bump January. Right? So it if the close date is still December t thirty, it's still a possibility the first week, we'll we'll see what happens. But again, you know, you know, goes.

Client 2: And radical Vc, are you joining the call today I can.

Host 1: It wasn't on my calendar. When is that taking place it's a review for their they're opt out. Right Yeah not, but I can.

Host 1: What do you recommend Merry is Did you work closely with the prospect?

Client 2: Do you feel like you developed a strong relationship?

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, Leah is the prospect over there. I would I would say Everyone that says yes. I have a pretty good relationship with. So I'd be like more than half be to jump on that review call, as long as, you know, Merry is good with it. Who else typically goes on those calls Merry?

Client 3: It is just Merry, but it could be nice if you know, especially considering we're concerned about their opt rates if you join. And looks like it's at right after this call at one o'clock.

Client 3: Oh, you're free.

Host 1: So how long... Are those, like, a thirty minute call?

Host 1: Okay. I will message Merry and see if I can jump on. I you big at one thirty. But if the calls don't take more than thirty minutes then Yeah. It makes sense for me to hop on there. It'd be good to touch base with Leah again.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. If it hasn't made a... A slam dunk could help send Okay? Well have we counted the five k into the Arr?

Client 3: No because we don't build them until after if they opt in Okay.

Client 2: Great Okay. So that'll see. Yeah wanted to step back backwards.

Host 1: So that i mean, that'd be really good to get them to take the next steps. I mean, have we have we had any, like, similar use cases where let's say... Merry said there's a lot opt in. I mean, what's the what's the chances to them renewing to an annual?

Client 3: Think pretty good. I think sometimes know I don't know what context Merry had for saying that, But like sometimes for example, like, Medical Alley didn't have very many opt and then they renewed and became one of our largest customers because even though we were only putting, you know, ten or fifteen people in touch, that was still, like, highly valuable to them in their community. It really depends. So I don't know if Merry had asked them what they're stations were in the beginning and that's what you know, they expected higher or whatnot not, but sometimes you know, people are pleasantly surprised by even lower opt. So It could go you could...

Host 1: I'll plan and joining. I'll take a look at their numbers. Just so Prep that that conversation, but Leah came in she used our platform through vc platform so she she loves us. She already said there's budget for for five k. So Yeah. Hopefully I think it's pretty strong. Least in my conversations for that renew, but hopefully that's the case.

Client 3: Cool Awesome.

Client 2: Alright. Well, I wanted to start with your pipeline because I know it's gonna look a lot more Pipeline looks good.

Client 3: You're quite really good. Is it do you feel like outbound is helping or is this mostly inbound?

Host 1: Let's see here. Latitude a can't I have an el learning chat tomorrow morning with T tara dot doom. A helping a lot of them are inbound. And I'm glad that some inbound closing Year is probably eighty twenty. Eighty eighty percent inbound.

Client 2: Christina Lopez was an end user. She's part of the Dreamers doors. Thing an us for an intro?

Client 3: So ask Yeah.

Client 2: Double check if that's correctly set up on Salesforce, but that was the end user. And then else did we have? That seemed familiar Mckenzie the War Mary you it goes through, that would be that would be a warm intro I I'm thinking some bigger deals Let me just share a couple that could be bigger.

Host 1: So inside dot com they were outbound Oh, wow Would you say the fifth wall is how it could be if it before come about?

Client 2: Was that Vc platform?

Client 2: where I think I saw a busy platform, so community type, portfolio.

Host 1: I'm not sure. It came from Adi. Okay. Gosh. I should pull in where they came from. The description maybe.

Client 2: Source was just above.

Client 3: Had we have laid source too. Source.

Host 1: So was that a?

Client 3: Mh. That's great.

Host 1: Yes she did mention Vc platform afterwards.

Client 2: But that... Yeah, that's great. And that kind of, i guess to utilize it.

Host 1: Yeah. It's always nice. Even with Yu, I mean, Yu ubi was inbound, but they're they're decision maker use it and give it a ten out of ten. So, I mean, is usually a really good sign that Yeah. They they're interested in taking the next steps. The cha wasn't outbound. They're pretty large deal. They're just they push it to to mid one. That's the only best thing i'm finding. Like, train was also an outbound. He also pushed it Right.

Host 1: Yeah Good.

Client 3: Well it's like great to see also you're having some bigger ticket items in here.

Client 2: Yeah. Well, done That's very healthy in comparison to my anemic pipeline. I've actually cleaned up a few names and still left. Potentially viable for end of December. What's missing over here is Uber, which in my mind was an absolute given. But I chase my friend. Offline being like, hey, We gonna need that deal. Can we like get it signed for the New year, and she was like, even though she's super senior. She said they've had from the very top, complete budget freeze and also freeze on new new suppliers being approved before year end So she said there's still a chance, but whether we'll have to be in the new year instead of the moment. It's like it's just a total freeze become literally like, We can't do anything. Yes. So that's been... That's that's been disappointing because in my mind, that was a given. And then I also removed Bald that was That's another Uk fund, ten k, I've chased number of times and the last I jason him with Oc ventures. I think if there was anything that would move with them it was done. But I think I might nudge them one more time in mid December just as like miracle push, but probably unlikely. So I I said it as a closing data in of january when I'm month there meet up with them, hope really have some of good results without first, and we use that. Oh, no. I think I... Yeah. So I still left as a miracle deal for December, club down that was one that I was really hoping to push through right the last couple of days of November. We had a pencil onboarding call. But The buyer is so swamped. She's only one person, and I think ultimately just didn't manage to align with finance and Legal on about reviewing the the document and I told about that I hope this offer no onboarding fee twenty twenty two pricing until the end of December. So I'll not sure a couple days time again. And then... Oh, kindred. That's still in my Two and a half thousand deal, need to seek legal advice probably around that's gonna be and multiples of that, but anyhow, it's it's still staying over here. And then have call first thing in the morning with back Vc. That was a prospect that's finally, they're coming back to years zone, ready for us. So hoping that b five k deal comes through. Pushing for C partnership, which would be which actually we might be paying for, but it's a it's it's a a twenty twenty thousand by our community, which I'm hoping will be the next vc platform, basically for knee purposes and Yeah. If that happens. That would be like But Yeah. Let's see. I still have to speak to the community manager over there.

Host 1: What's the...

Host 1: So Just gonna ask on C, what would be like, the the reason they they partner Like, what's the value for them?

Client 2: Well, we would literally pay for them to use Orbit, which is what We see platform. Try to to get us to do. We're basically giving up the tool for free. We... That was the trip that And Adi went to the first week when you joined, it was the big Cx x conference. And I think we page two k or two three to basically exhibit were some junior startup of hunter. And now they're getting us to be twenty twenty three sponsors, and we basically said, they send us a bunch of packages the entry point is five k, then there's a digital pack package could dot seven k, but it's all, like having your logo here in there, and we were like, Hey. We would we were interested in being a sponsor in Brought partnership blah blah, but the only thing that would get us to sponsor, you guys? It's adopting the product. I mean, that's the only thing. That would actually make a difference for us. So the More junior person was like, I did a demo for him. He's on board. He introduced me now to the community directors, so we'll see and I was like, this is actually gonna be over twenty k partnership for you because we'll give you the top tier and will pay another seven k users. That would be like the major twenty twenty three marketing. It stands for us. If they agree it. And their communities twenty thousand community managers and like top top top companies. So It it sounds like a good deal for them.

Host 1: And we're also paying them and giving them the the top tier.

Client 2: I know. Right? But he was concerned about how what other sponsors he was like, well, all our response in general us. So why would we favor you over others especially if they're paying more. And you do... He did also have some concern around Yeah. Data privacy stuff, which I tried to nip in the vibe. So we'll see. We'll see. Can see how it's not a given. We've had these conversations with previous, like, more independent communities, they don't wanna be seen favoring tools. But on the other hand, they... I mean, they use Slack, for example. They were really really benefit from this.

Host 1: And you brands though. Would you see that it's orbit?

Client 2: So We will see how we're gonna do it with Dc plus form. I think we still I think we still gave them the the the right to have their branding, but because it says whoever is interested, with Platform, even when they then the first the proposal, the promotional email. This is what we're going be using a mere fact that they chose orbit. We had we have needs coming in out at every stage of the process even before people actually have their matches. V platform announced the partnership boom we had a drop They said the opt in email, people were like oh I god up to you. It's so easy I need to for my fun, boom, we had another influx of leads then they have their conversations. Boom we want this for the portfolio, and then with each matching around, we still get the odds inbound. So No. This would be this would be very very very exciting. It happens, it would make everything worth it, but let's see yet to yet to demo to the community manager. So we'll see. Also how the response from the director of Pop hubspot community. The guy that i'm met person and he then introduced me to have spun inbound. Trying to get a follow call cops hubspot involved, but he basically said if you guys remember he was interested in India indiana tiny tiny pilot and I told him it would at least be an onboarding one and a half, and then he goes to me, and then I sent you my email being like, hey, is the field blocker here you know, if he asked happy to get creative, like, let me know and he responded, you know, hey, you know, what at this stage at this moment, Actually, the bigger blockers that our end users are super busy, and he said we're getting some budget in the New year for experiments. So let's circle go back then. It was actually a positive side in January. We could could do something with them. and Follow demo tomorrow with community people that the Cfo connected us to. And I have another demo tonight with a company called house, which is a big interior design company, I had a first demo and happened I see them.

Client 3: Like, every time I Google house stuff, they pop up with articles or something, They're big.

Client 2: Yes. They're big.

Client 2: Yeah. had an intro call. It was a mormon intro spoke to them online while I was in San Francisco, and they basically finished and were like, is not what we're interested in. So they work there like now.

Client 2: Mh But they were interested. The only thing they said they would be sit is seeing how it works its group matching. So tomorrow, the to today. The demo is specifically group matching. I haven't actually even put it in here. I wanna see if it's even qualified after the demo. Yeah.

Host 1: The new you're gonna show them. On the platform then? With group matching.

Client 2: Adi had... Let me just see.

Host 1: It was like a deck?

Client 2: Yes. I'll show them this deck. Which I put together specifically for group matching. Three? So it's the usual how works, and then So it's very similar very similar it just shows you multiple people We only have two people here with inside partners rather at the declined that were demoing, but may know.

Host 1: See. Just a couple additions it looks like.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I mean I did tell them that the logic is very, very similar. But if they don't give me time day to show, so let's see. So we'll do that. Yeah. I mean, This at this stage, I would say it's more a question of pushing whatever. I can even smaller deals. A wild talk logo though. I mean, I'm so most hopeful on audacity and and then the partnership side of things with ce as well I wanna follow up with them today when we stop So Sylvia is is a group me that has acquired four of our clients. They basically their whole business model is acquiring communities and then introducing horizontal operational efficiencies. And they said they have at least another four clients for not for clients. But you have, four communities in there Brown, that would benefit in imminent from Orbit, so we'll see if interested sitting in continuing the conversation. And then I could put together an offer for them. Super super discounted, they're very aggressive. If if we do that, we'd literally have to give the product away, but at this stage, whatever especially if we can log them in on a two year contract, can offer some discoveries someone skills.

Host 1: Do you have any bigger deals than playing. Like, forty k, thirty k scenarios.

Client 2: Well, I had put in Cambridge associates which came back saying that they don't have a budget. And then the super well card is have hubspot inbound.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 2: I had to call when someone that's involved with the conference, he said he's interested in surfacing it up their Vpn team. So I'm waiting for that to be scheduled. But i'll schedule data. I'll chase him today.

Host 1: That'll take a long time though. Right? I mean, have hubspot like, What make Last june? They they will go very slow.

Client 2: Yeah And, we at last tomorrow, billy.

Client 3: That's still we sent them the updated questionnaire last week. I asked and timing for the rest of the year they didn't respond, but we could ask again tomorrow.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: I'm just thinking if if we got obviously a last scene and then we'd be up for seven hundred k.

Host 1: Yep. Right by end of year.

Client 3: But I mean, Adam don't...

Host 1: It sounds like Yeah.

Client 2: That's... I'm just really, really not. I hope I given what my friend told me it uber, I'm just getting nervous about any Hey then Yeah.

Client 2: company wide other freezes. Galadriel really you wanna share some tell what's happening at at hybrid just in terms of company measures.

Client 3: Yeah. So they were supposed to raise their c this fall and they've been closing huge deals. Like, my friend told me they closed their biggest six figure deal just two months ago. They were all celebrating. I think it was like, three hundred k to two to three hundred k. But they've been consistently hitting quota and have decided that they're not going to fund and then lieu that there extending their runway. To It was twenty four months. They're extending our twenty four months. They cut salaries at the top level. And they're just no more new spending, hiring freeze they didn't have to have layoffs luckily. But no off sites which they had all sides like, every other on there maybe every month. They were very, very all heavy. And just slowing down oh they, like, cut their office spaces, they went back slowly remote just cutting overhead altogether so that they could extend runway. So That's one that we don't care about in the news, but it's, like very real. That's a big time... They have hundred employees, it's a big company.

Host 1: Is it because maybe they didn't get the wrong that they... Obviously i didn't get the wrong that they wanted. Right? So they just decided to push it off and they, can get more people to come on the rounds. Maybe later in the year or something like that.

Client 3: No. There... Yeah. I think they're they're concerned with valuation pressures more than anything. And if they push it off a year and keep showing good revenue growth, then maybe evaluations will come back up. And if they can kind of tighten the belt a little bit, between now and then, then it'll pay off for them if they can get a higher valuation year. They're they're... I don't think they're gonna try and raise it. At least that they're saying is they're sitting runway to twenty four months and not trying to go out and raise again till the the earliest a year from now.

Client 2: Interesting. yeah. There's very few investments. There's very few deals actually happening and those that are happening are happening on, like, a fraction of the valuation that from the blue market and from what founders are hoping for so you're literally giving away the company at the moment, and you raised absolutely, you know, if it's a complete and utter necessity, but if there's anything that you can at the moment that's That's what's happening.

Client 3: Mh.

Client 2: So, yeah. These are the things that we're there were dealing way that... yeah, his Galadriel was saying that's not necessarily making headlines, but Has there been any...

Host 1: I know we're doing our our twenty twenty three playing Like, next week. Right? But has there been any changes like in the past week or two weeks on anything goals, sales, projections, things like that I think let's stay focused on your end what we set out.

Client 2: And... Yeah. I think I think I think we'll we'll be working on a plan a b c in terms of if we hit them, if we don't hit them, but of the time being you're our our winning race force. So just stay focused.

Host 1: Okay. Sounds good Yeah.

Host 1: I'm still to optimistic on on el learning on the pipeline. So hopefully just continues to build up January we'll we'll pick up for sure. So... Yeah. I'm so optimistic about it.

Client 2: Nice I'm still up to optimistic. I mean, I'm definitely optimistic about landing above seven hundred. Eight hundred given that i've had to push so many deals to the new year or completely just like had. The bigger tickets that I was relying on Cambridge associates, the Course the hubspot of the world. Yeah. I don't know, that would be a stretch unless you carry through the entire quota of knee. But... Right. What about data did i'm give it the list of end users? To be hitting up or we Yep today.

Host 1: Yeah he sent those over to today. And then I just got into Alba cross. So I'll start mister Around with that, we'll see something comes up. I told him at least a deal a month has gotta come out of that thing, which hopefully, that's at the minimum.

Client 2: Right? Okay. Well that would be amazing Roi given that they're two k. A deal month would be amazing.

Host 1: Well, if there if they're... I said, one hundred ten every prospects right. So if we convert ten percent of all the good ones, then that should be like a pretty standard rate not even getting in there yet.

Host 1: So.

Client 2: Okay? And you said you want me to email two space who's on the spreadsheet. I wanna take a look at it now. But Yeah.

Host 1: So I actually have three. I wanted to add some more in there. But let's take a look. So latitude.

Host 1: Might refresh or refresh miami and then J learning. I don't think you've been in contact with anyone over there. Right? Latitude, refresh miami in a duty learning.

Client 2: Right? No. We're refresh miami actually, I was excited to be on the discovery call.

Client 2: Yeah. That's the one that I commented that I'm reading resources on, like, what's going on given that I'm in Miami could meet them.

Host 1: Yeah. I even I've been followed up yet I thought it was just... You wanted to say in touch with, like, communications afterwards Okay. My bad is.

Client 2: That's okay. I mean, if it's a five k deal, It it was it was a good chat.

Host 1: They're super small. I mean, it's gonna be under five k, actually, so we'll see what she comes back on. But So you said charity They're five zero one c three.

Host 1: So they're nonprofit.

Client 2: Wow, who runs it.

Host 1: I don't know. Okay. She she just got brought on as the Coo and in charge of growing the platform, members, revenue, everything. So I think there's a pretty strong use case she's super interested. But I mean, they're not making anything. At this point, They're making, like, ten k revenue from their paid users. It's not like we can come in and take half their earnings on one tool.

Client 2: Know what I Have... I I get I mean, I'm sure it's the same thing. I can refresh miami, newsletters and they're basically sponsored. So B is a big deal. They... It's like a is a newsletter, Yeah.

Client 2: Surprise of their profit per s.

Host 1: Might he's not be honest with me on on how much her members are paying, but she said, she has like, a hundred paid members in mow like, ninety five percent or ten dollars a month. And then they give them advertising in the newsletter or priority with events, things like that.

Client 2: Refresh Miami. Refresh miami dot com. Yeah. It's the latest miami tech news, proudly supported by Bricks. I went to a major, like, B if event now for art basel, they have, like, sponsored branded the hell out of everything. Bricks are spending, like, crazy stone. I'm sure. I mean, probably sponsored by Brexit that they're paying for for this newsletter.

Host 1: B is a bank ring.

Client 2: It's a it's our credit card. Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: What's the fintech? Yeah. I well, I don't know if they're, like, super young, so they're given, like a really good deal, B. You know what I mean, like, we're doing with let's say, our clients, I don't know how much drugs is actually paying them.

Client 2: Yeah. Oh, sponsored listing. On deck, So they have job postings as well.

Client 2: I'll move to you. Because they're definitely it's not just about paid members. The have a miami tech. I mean, Let's see. Would be or maybe we're also If we give them a discount, maybe we also try and get the brand name a little bit more prominent in there.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: The other thing is do you want volunteer for in person coffee?

Host 1: Or for her to meet up with you?

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. If once tomorrow will be around I did mention that I'll I'll follow today and and I'll put that in the email.

Client 2: Yeah. Feel free to see Me.

Client 2: Okay. Then i'll jump on.

Host 1: All comes all Ccm.

Client 2: Cool That will be fun.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: I'm sure all in person coffee gonna help get those four and a half k.

Host 1: Do we wanna do we wanna do that in instead of you sending any email to her like this.

Client 2: Is that the perfect? I think I think a better Chase for her will be. Can you show a screen again on a on list?

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: So before when I jumped in, it was more like k sorry. Busy a week out of the award. Do you want me to say here?

Host 1: So, like, with latitude Just like, something is super short it's really modify this, but basically saying like, talks with, I'm here if you need...

Host 1: Like, anything... Issues just to checking from the Ceo, it actually helps quite a bit.

Host 1: Alright. It's similar it's the same email for Yeah.

Host 1: Sure also, because Luke and I have actually had to chat with her.

Host 1: She's pretty warm.

Client 2: Okay. Great. So maybe, yeah. Perfect. I'll I'll wait for nicole. And I'll jump on that maybe with some with this wording and just saying i would love to you just got broad as a Coo? Or new see is coming in on tomorrow when we working. I was strategy to. Let's grab coffee on Thursday.

Host 1: With... Are you... Are you martin with Nicole on that one?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. And you want me to email her?

Client 2: Yes. If you would mind Yep.

Client 2: You just think you're going to be chasing her?

Host 1: Yeah Yeah. I've I have a follow to send her. So I will include that. I'll make sure included on that and then recommend Yeah.

Client 2: So after you chase her, I'll jump on.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Okay. Amazing. So, okay. So we're still doing the push with end users. So Alba cross and end users are the two kind of big finally your pushes in terms of new leads.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, other cross, I don't expect like, too much on. I mean, if we get one or two people to, like, have conversation. I think that's like really good but...

Host 1: And I don't know what it's gonna be, like with the super users, but I'm gonna do a push with them. I'm gonna probably set it up today and send out first thing tomorrow.

Client 2: Okay Cool Alright.

Host 1: Outbound still is still there. I guess, I'm I have a big question mark on how aggressive I again outbound as we head into the second half of December. I'm gonna I'm gonna just stay consistent. I'm not gonna tone down anything. The only reason I would tone down anything is if people are out of office, if they're not gonna respond they're not gonna get future, sequences in my emails And so might reduce the potential in January But I think I think that might be negligible.

Host 1: So I'm just gonna keep pushing be consistent. I don't see the reason not to.

Client 2: Okay. I'm leaving leaving it due to decide even then you have experience with outbound if this is likely to get lost in the noise or if people's in inbox are actually a little bit calmer and they could be doing research in between Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. I mean, the highest priority is converting these deals in the pipeline.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah He seem to still have a few really good ones. Cool. I feel like you weren't gonna say face something.

Client 3: Now I feel like this week everybody still very much in in office and, like, still working. I think after this week, it's gonna just looking at the calendar. I think after this week, definitely, like, mid week next week. It's gonna start quiet.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. I feel like Maybe even next week is still pretty solid this still a whole week before Christmas.

Client 2: Feel like maybe for still stuff going on in terms of journal calls, and then this week, and then from next week, more like internal i'll project and goals and strategy the week just before christmas. I'm gonna think of our year end celebration, Yeah. And then And then if the end, Well, I'm excited. Get a few more contracts. So let's just see where we land. Obviously, as last is the big one. So every day tomorrow.

Client 2: Yeah. Me what time are you landing tomorrow just so I can plan on where we taking back call from am landing at Ten Am for ten thirty.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 3: So I could And you draw my bags at the hotel, freshen up and then come over?

Client 2: Yeah. So I'm just thinking that maybe we also do with the founders fund office tomorrow for the afternoon?

Client 3: Okay I'm gonna double check.

Client 2: Can you give me your hotel name again? What did you know when it's called?

Client 3: I do. I rebranded. It It was Pal house, Miami. P a l i house Miami, they sent me an email today that they have a new name. When I see.

Client 2: Just so I can do a little bit of planning what's gonna be closer. This is Fire on this office.

Client 2: Maybe you should meet me here to, like, really see the full spec from window office, Standard son, Soho house on Thursday. We'll see.

Client 3: Far it. That's. That's what they rebranded to.

Client 2: Okay. Alright. Perfect. I'll take a look.

Host 1: How is Miami I mean, in general, it's it was definitely an interesting social experiment kind of living here.

Client 2: But that's what I was telling. Hugh this morning. I don't think I could be here. I like giving a city where I feel like I'm like, I'm I'm involved in, like I'm involved with what the city kind of represents which I don't know. I feel more in the mix. And the thing is Miami, when you look at it. It's in mid so latin. It's crypto. It's mh entertainment. It's probably a lot of, like, underworld type businesses and i I I just feel like Yeah. It's gonna be hard for me to live here and really feel like I belong. So from that point of view, new... Yeah. New York and London that right two cities it's been nice to have a little bit of son here and there and the weekends have been lovely a lot of people passing through town. Our basel was absolutely nuts. Was my first art basel, basically, the major event of the year and such I mean we absolutely didn't really know where to go or didn't get the best invites in town. That's, like you're in La when the oscars are happening, you wouldn't automatically, like, being the make. So it's a little bit my art basel. We have no idea. What's going on, but I kept seeing on Instagram, all the celebrities, you know, the kardashians and Yeah. Also celebrities is posting there in add basel. We just saw the traffic and we had a lot of friends visiting for parties didn't have the time for that. But when to see did the convention center saw some art. It was it was fun to feel the buzz and it was to live here for a month, but and build close relationships with. Our investor that lives down here stefan defined, our bulgaria investor was over year for our basel as well. So had an person copy with him last week. So... Yeah, Basically, it was It was it was interesting to experience. Wouldn't live here.

Host 1: I think before the pandemic, a lot of companies were moving to Miami Right? Even like from California and, like, even from Texas. Right? How did is that not happening as much anymore.

Client 2: I mean, I'm still hearing about this founder and that founders. So I'm hearing a lot about founders that have exited and they're relocating here, so it's more city to kind of spend a lot of crypto founders. Do you guys know moon?

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: What is that?

Client 2: What is that mean?

Host 1: I've I've heard of moon.

Client 2: Some big crypto payment company, the founder through a massive art basel party.

Client 2: You had grinds performing live, all sorts of like activations. That's the word. The word that I've been hearing the most the last to recently has been activation. Everyone is activating something I went to a b on Friday evening, and that was a major motivational for Brad, and basically means lots of buzz things with... I don't know. Vr headsets, live band and people doing r and d dancing and sliders. It's basically a funky event and everyone's doing those and everyone's activating They literally people stop you on the street. Like, do you know where the device activation is? And I'm like don't know. Keep going straight. There's an activation, definitely left price and turned backwards.

Host 1: Seems like all crypto crypto companies like this very similar or the same or, like, fintech. You know what I mean?

Host 1: Yeah. Was just gonna are you guys you interested in crypto? I mean, are you are you on the crypto? Or you transcript?

Client 3: For it.

Client 3: Yep. Very excited about everything that's happening right now, so I think it's gonna create ton of opportunity.

Host 1: It's the big the big X situation and a classroom for.

Host 1: And guess you're buying the downside. Right?

Client 3: Yeah. And then the other one that went... That filed for bankruptcy last week, I can't remember, but Yeah. It's fascinating.

Client 2: Are you guys buying?

Client 3: I've been buying for the last... Yeah. Two years. I just have, like, a little bit of money every every... Like, nothing. Nothing consequences like, nothing of consequence, but, like, little bits here and there But Yeah. I think it's really interesting.

Host 1: Maybe Ethereum. I used to get paid in crypto when I was in san Go. He he would ping me... I'm sorry. He's a baby, premium bitcoin.

Client 3: Oh.

Host 1: That was, like, two thousand thirteen or something like that.

Client 3: And... Like in this like the biggest scenario you've ever received, Yeah.

Host 1: I I that.

Host 1: I I'm like, can you please stop paying me in bitcoin? I don't of you paid me. Gave me to go or his bitcoin company and Yeah. I mean, I did nothing with it.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: I mean, I wanna do a I wanna put probably a couple of thousand more as a learning opportunity, but yeah. My husband, and I would just completed and get in on the on the crypto stuff, we've be seeing it as a bubble, especially like our ninety ones are sixty plus filipino na, one day bi mistake texted us. A prince screen of how she's putting five k to bitcoin on top of the bubble. Where like, okay. This is happening, friends like brown mountain and bulgaria were ping their granddaughter and son's being like, hey, how do we put money in this I mean, I don't know. We we've seen it and and believe it's a bubble. And now it's birthday, Actually, we think it's probably gonna go down a little bit more. And then we'll try and buy the bottom, maybe one of the page. Months. But... Yeah. And also with the end effects now, I have friends that are very much into the crypto space and they know really successful people that lost like one recently it was complaining. I was forty million of personal cash and. I we, obviously you have forty million to lose it just in that. There's more where that came from, but don't know. It's it still feels like... blockchain is technology yes, but n t's and Crypto and all the tucker and just seeing how think these activations are just so gimmicky, Yeah this tough right now.

Client 2: Up to this time. I think it's a very Generative Ai is a new trend. I'm, like, a thousand times more excited about and see the potential and see how disrupting and is going to be, and I get it a lot more intuitive me. But the whole N thing and the qr code and the whole wild see... I I don't know. I don't know. I've been I've been more in the skeptical side.

Host 1: Yeah. N entities or... you know, really skeptical, but there are some cool things with cheese. Maybe they'll figure something out. With that. But it's still time to crypto down the blockchain chain. So that adoption. Right is the biggest hurdle adults mass market.

Client 2: If you if you figure out if if if you guys if you have to consensus this on what, must ball and the timing of it hit me up.

Client 3: I think my philosophy is, like, if the exact... The top five executives is all over in a penthouse together in the Caribbean, not a great company to invest in.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Like, I think that, like, I think ethereum and Bitcoin. Are pretty solid.

Client 3: Yeah. The only two I buy. But, yeah, Everything else is just like a lot of noise.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, the Dodge coins what the hell, I know.

Client 2: Alright. Cool. Well, nice to chat. Sorry. Wicked we didn't get to have a little miami reunion but Have you spent much time here?

Host 1: Yeah. That sounds great. Everyone from Reykjavik goes down to Florida to retire. Right? That's like take the retirement spot. Probably same thing for my.
