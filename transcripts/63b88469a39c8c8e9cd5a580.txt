Client 1: Hello?

Host 2: Hey, what's up?

Client 1: Hi.

Host 2: How are you?

Client 1: Good. How are you?

Client 1: How Too.

Client 1: And having some cafe now it's so good Oh wow.

Host 2: Nice. Let me see. I can't see your name come up actually. Like your screen. See.

Client 1: And iphone f one f Yeah.

Host 2: I know. But it's usually and takes, like, a little block on here and I don't see it.

Client 3: Scroll on team.

Host 2: Hey hey what's up everyone?

Client 1: Galadriel.

Client 3: Months.

Client 3: What's you're grabbing on and?

Client 1: Jacob What about you?

Client 3: I'm had a good come out in a while. Just some leftover from yesterday actually. I had like Surf and turf burger what hop your arms.

Client 3: I'm calling. Good. Someone who who that. Just how to check one in the background.

Client 1: You go skiing No.

Client 3: Here's the whole thing. Don't wanna get too deep into it. It was just an unfortunate situation.

Host 2: Let's see. Who who waiting on. Speaking of scale the participant thing throws me off when everyone's note takers in here. It says we have one more people me do.

Client 3: Here me stop that.

Client 4: We are nine these days in engineers.

Host 2: Yeah.

Client 5: Sorry.

Client 3: That's something I was gonna mention, we should figure out if there's a way to automatically turn off the fathom recorder, like, I noticed a lot of the times. The Sdr will have their thousand quarter pawn if they don't hop onto the call, then we'll have two records. Recording the same call?

Client 5: You should be able to turn it off there should be like a thing in your browser. And it'll it'll like, pop up by anytime you have a meeting it says automatically record with Fathom. You can turn that off.

Client 4: And if you're the host too, you can also build them Yeah.

Host 2: Yeah. I I I all the other ones so they didn't show up on here.

Host 2: You guys see the little blocks. You shouldn't see the blocks on here.

Client 3: True for the house reboot them. I don't think I know how to do that. But I was trying to do that the other day and I wasn't the host. On the Zoom meeting, I think that's something else that we need is solidify is when the Sdr setup up meetings, use... Right now, they're using our calendar links, but their zoom leaks, and it should be the exact opposite.

Host 2: Yeah. I just select Mark to see if you could jump on I threw on the invite thirty minutes ago, but their meeting might be running over the they me right before this. So okay. Cool. He should be jumping on. How's is everyone's week?

Client 5: Too.

Host 2: What was that Danny?

Client 4: Mine's been crazy.

Host 2: Yeah. I'm sure dude dallas yeah now.

Client 4: I drove drove from Utah Dallas. From monday, I guess, Tuesday afternoon got here like eight Am on Wednesday, What's straight to practice for like, six hours?

Client 4: Were moving into money place. And next week, actually in the next, like, week and a half or so. My schedule start to, like, finalize but right now, there's like, all the international guys are coming in like kinda like, hey. Like, literally just now. They're like, we're here at the doctor's off doing... Are like, pre ekg.

Client 4: And there's an issue with Ekg machines. So, like, two thirds team just left. I was like, I'm hanging out anyways. I got a meeting. So yeah. So I'll stick around and wait for it, because I guess just being super slow. Like it's just been kinda crazy, but, like, Great. It's been awesome.

Client 4: Yeah. It's it's been a wild week, but wise there's actually quite a few cool things going on. We're working on a big deal with the company called solar wave. Got a meeting schedule with them from next week, super up and I think, like, thirty thousand dollars a month.

Client 4: And then we're working on just, like, picking up the slack on a couple of others. Couple... I had a really good partnership meeting yesterday with valley here for japan's gonna bring stuff about this because we're gonna talk about that next. Is it next week that we're doing? The training with them Yeah.

Host 2: Next Friday.

Client 4: So, yeah. Some cool stuff moving. But yeah, been run around like, a ticket was my head to cut off for the last for last week, for sure.

Client 4: So getting this sorted.

Host 2: Good. Yeah. Let me... Let me go our the calendar invites Saying kinda go through what I had on the agenda. And then we can chat about the rest of like the Sdr. The Sc sdr staff with Mark, what's he's able to jump on. So one I wanna talk to you guys about facilitation of the onboarding call. So when we close a deal, just need to make sure that we're communicating that with both Sarah and Rachel. So I don't know if you guys have met rachel. She's been on here like once or twice for these calls. But Rachel is gonna be running a lot of the O kelly drop off.

Client 5: She's trying camera off.

Client 6: No. I'm still here.

Host 2: Oh, that's weird. I can't see you. I think it's, like, that setting that Okay. It. Yeah. So Rachel is gonna be jumping on every single onboarding call with sarah going forward. Right? Like, we're not closing at a fast enough rate yet. That we require, like multiple Cs. So because she's in the onboarding process of actually getting them live and getting their code implemented if they're on shopify.

Host 2: She's gonna be kind of leading the direction there and answering any type of technical questions after deals has been closed. And that... Like I said, only refers to Shopify merchants moving forward. So I wanna give you guys a heads up there. So it is our risk once we've closed the deal, to schedule an onboarding call and make sure that Sarah is aware that and rachel. You guys go with that?

Client 5: There's Cc on the email.

Host 2: Yeah. Just cc see them on the email then and then sarah will just reach out to them and and schedule it herself. Cool.

Client 3: Okay. I think I think we have an onboarding set up with Wild Tuesday and I didn't include rachel on that, so I'll go ahead and yeah.

Host 2: Throw throw rachel on there if you can. Let me do that real quick Give me one second.

Host 2: Yeah. I can't see if anyone else is on here. Unless you're camera is being shared.

Client 5: Turn that off as you have, like the Just add on.

Host 2: What's that?

Client 5: It their camera not on, it looks like pushes out.

Host 2: Mh.

Client 5: Yeah. You can turn that off.

Host 2: We go. You know where you turn that on?

Client 5: Turn that out. Can just on Zoom dot us volt to there. Or meeting. Can't I can't do it because I'm not the host, but I see that on Zoom dot Us and it says, like, hide others.

Client 3: It does... Yeah. I should say hi non video not here.

Host 2: Yeah. I just Weird. Yeah.

Client 3: Okay. Order protection.

Host 2: Yes. So I did hide others. I don't wanna because I only... Yeah. I seem and just I but If you just click any one of our names at the top, like, iphone...

Client 3: The the three little dots, Harrison meeting, you could it's just a high non video participant.

Host 2: I know. That's why I... I'm trying to undo it. Is one what I'm saying.

Client 3: This just left time corner.

Client 3: Same No.

Host 2: It's just saying Pin or chat.

Client 5: Oh it's center licenses. Go to Zoom. And then preferences.

Host 2: K. And give you that.

Client 5: It should give you that option. I I can't do it because I'm not over the the call Let's see.

Host 2: Sorry guys. Give me one second.

Client 3: That's funny. It's only says. That's interesting. Okay.

Host 2: K. Whatever. It's not Yeah. I'm looking at the different type of settings here.

Client 5: You go to video it's on video.

Host 2: Yeah and it says hide non participants.

Client 5: You see that.

Host 2: U yeah. Have that checked Oh uncheck it.

Host 2: There we go. Okay. I weird was unchecked, and then I Checked it. Okay. Cool. Sweet. So anyways, yeah. So let's go through. So that's one of the things I wanna talk about today. So just make sure that we're we're scheduling those onboarding calls just because I want that to be as smooth as possible. Super quick hand off and then rachel and Sarah will get it live from there. Right? So that's kinda where our journey stops. And then it's up to them to get that that account live Right? So if there's any other, like, details you have to go through is, like, billing and things around that, then then we'll handle that again. We just need to make sure that the the off super claimed the customer knows who owns that relationship moving forward. K. Next one is deals to close this month. I just want to talk briefly high level. I want you guys and we're not gonna like know that on calls before it would go through, like, all the individual deals that we're to close we talked about them for, like, ten seconds. I just want you guys in in your one on ones with me to have perhaps some of that information that I sent over and the deal closer sales channel. Like, Malik and I had a one on one yesterday. It's more productive if we just dive directly like accounts that you think are gonna close this month a percentage that you think they're at in terms of their likelihood or their probability of closing. So we're not just saying like, oh, yeah. Like pretty confident this deals gonna close. I'd rather know, like, Hey, this one has a contract out for signature. There just like, just waiting on the Ceo, to make the final decision, like I need that information in notes. On the deal so that when I look at the probability of that closing, it's... We can actually turn in and forecast out the accuracy of a bit more. Is that all clear there?

Client 3: Yes, sir.

Client 4: Cool.

Client 1: Yep. Yes?

Host 2: Yeah. That's one thing Petunia keeps drilling me on is he'll go in and look at a deal and if there's no notes, we have no idea, like, we've done outside of some of the emails that we've sent back and forth So... Yes. Moving forward for one on ones, they're are gonna be a little less casual. Just wanna make sure that we've got something to go through and that we're on track to close the deals that we're know, we say we're gonna close. Cool.

Host 2: K. Next one is quarterly quotas this this directly applies. Anna you don't really You're not lumped into this because you're not full time.

Host 2: But for all the account executives, quarterly quota one point five million dollars of contracted Arr. So what that means is based on what they do on a monthly basis, we basically multiply that by twelve. Terms of the revenue we think we're gonna get from the account I want you guys to conservatively when you put the amounts into some of these deals, conservatively put put, like, you know, you're crunching the numbers estimate, forty percent attachment on some of these. Right? And, like, it's a little easier for us because we use static pricing. So pricing on a per order basis, doesn't fluctuate as much? As we roll out the functionality of dynamic pricing, it's gonna get harder to determine whether or not we are hitting quota, So wanna give you heads up there. We're doing quarterly. I think monthly is a little tough, especially for the deal sizes that we're trying to target.

Host 2: Ultimately, the types of deals that close in a month are, like, smaller deals. Did have something to say on that.

Client 4: Sorry. I thought I was muted, but I'm not Oh, no.

Host 2: You're could. I just saw you're saying pop up.

Client 4: Yeah. No. No. All I was gonna say is, like, I think with our deal sizes quarter the quota, like, that is a luxury Yeah So do not take advantage of that.

Host 2: Yep.

Client 4: Yeah. Do not take advantage of that, make sure that you are managing your pipeline well and effectively because I think that Monthly quotas and a lot of ways are more effective for drive performance. We are getting a lot of trust and having quarterly quotas. So was not Let's not abuse that. Let's manage our pipeline well. Let's make sure we're doing a good job. Let's make sure we're same as up to date as we came and hitting quota. So once again, like I said, just look at that as a luxury, look that a way that order production taking care of you. Because it's it's definitely definitely a luxury have a quarterly quota.

Host 2: Awesome. Yeah. And and the reason for that too is is we have goal to hit twenty million dollars of of revenue or contract. For this year. It's a lofty goal. We've got a elaine team looking at hiring or bringing on to additional I this month. One of them is gonna be full time, more than of them is gonna be part time both from route. So they have books of business know how to sell into this market. They've been successful doing so. And so we need to one try and increase productivity. With our lean team because I don't wanna go and hire Like, in order to hit the number, what we forecast is is that we need twenty account executives. What that does to you guys and and me too, frankly, is... Limits the amount that we can make. It limits our potential to close more deals if we have to share it across you know, fifteen additional Aes That being said, I'd rather set this up in a way that we can run a little bit more lean we can be more efficient that But that that also means that we more need more productivity and output put out of our existing team You guys yeah quick note on.

Client 4: Yeah. If we did need to start introducing more a's, all that means is starting to make, you know, rules of engagement, more stringent starting set up territories verticals and then they none of us want that. So if we can perform really well and not have to worry about that. That is once again, another huge advantage to us. So let's take advantage of that best of our ability, you know, Yeah.

Host 2: Absolutely. Can show that, Danny? So, yeah, in terms of So we are... And I'll give you guys a kind of an update to on, like, the revenue tools side of things. Gonna be adopting some some more tools like a dial. Right? Like, we need be be making like a certain number of calls on a daily basis so that we can fill our pipeline. Outside of what Sdr are setting up for us. And so we we have already set up async sync with outreach so that I can be pulling all those metrics on like, a weekly basis. Into meta so I can internalize to say hey based on these dials made from these account executives, we can associate specific opportunities back to back to certain calls. Because, obviously, You know, that's just one piece of the puzzle. There's a lot that goes into prospecting. And so yeah, I wanna make sure that we're hitting hitting those calls and at least trying a prospect there. I know Mel had some good success there. And Frodo si to call in some some people from like, Linkedin and things like that. I know that you guys Malik and Frodo si, Don't wanna take too much more time outside of kind those those bullet points. I just went through the rest of what I had know that you guys. It didn't look like marks on here yet. And we can set up another meeting we wanna meet with Mark, but you you guys wanna kind of go over you know, the kind of problem that you're seeing we can kinda speak to that. So danny and Kelly and and Inner all aware. And then I will share out this doc as well with Danny. I don't know if he... He has access to it and Kelly as well. So Malik and Frodo guys wanna talk about kind of the the issues that you guys are running into from the from the Ae side.

Client 3: Yeah. I can I can start to talk about that. I do have a question about quota when I came in, I mean, I know Mj is not here anymore. I was told that quota for the year was going be five million dollars. And so... With the quarterly ones, that's only a million dollars more. I do know that we plan on expanding the team a little bit. And so that means, you know, we're gonna have maybe around, like, six account executives in total.

Client 3: So.

Host 2: Quota is gonna be five million. In what like, over the course of a year over course of year exactly.

Client 3: So that's only the difference of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per... Per quarter. You're asking, but, you know, a million dollars for the entire year. I guess maybe I'll I'm I'm saying Is there any way that we can stick to that number? And still, you know, try to achieve our goals because I think at six account executives if we all hit our quota and it's five million dollars.

Client 3: That would still be a thirty million dollar hit. For the year. And I know I'm the type of person that wants to excel. You know, in hit over my quota as well. But that's just the number that I was given when I came in, and that's kinda like what I set myself at and then if we can get into things like, you know, accelerators and things after that then, you know, Be. I just was told... I just had a little bit more incentive on the plate Yeah.

Host 2: Was anyone else told that? Just hire Danny were you guys given that same number?

Client 5: Yeah. I I was giving a same number. I mean, realistically, I didn't think that it was not necessarily obtain, but I think that it was I thought about the quarter quota just because coming from an eighty position. A monthly quote is harder to hit like, danny said it that it definitely keeps trying it total a lot more, but that quarterly quota makes a little bit more realistic. As far as closing deals because in then make sure every four months, you know, you have to hit that one point five, and I think like, really would you already at seven hundred fifty But you know, so I feel like it's more realistic hit a quarterly quota than it is like a yearly quota. Like because then it's like don't we're not tracking anything. We will, we won't we won't know like, how things are working if that makes any sense?

Client 3: Absolutely. Night. My my quarrel is not with the fact that it's quarterly I think that's actually solid. I wouldn't mind monthly, you know, like you said, I I do like one... You know, I have a little bit of pressure on my back. So it would really up to management on how they like to run that. But I just was told a specific number and that's number I had in my head, and I figured if I excel past that number then, you know, the percentage that I got back would, you know, I would then go into ramping or multiplier and such. And so what we're asking for right now is a difference of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars Arr every single quarter. Which would end up to a million million dollars at the end of the year. And I'm asking Topper Right now I'm saying, is it still possible to maybe lower that quota a little bit. Still hit our goals for the year and then you know, if if we all exceed our quota, then, you know, we can start getting into a little bit more of incentives.

Host 2: I mean, As of the team size right now in our current performance, it's it's one point five But as we onboard new Aes, it's gonna go down. Right? Just natural really because we're adding more people to it.

Host 2: Right. So... Yeah. I mean, I'm open to it, but, like, in terms of like, accelerators and stuff like we haven't talked about that at all with like, Harrison. And I don't know what's gonna past. Right Right now, it's it's that ten percent flat commission. And so... Yeah. I... I'm I'm... Yeah. I'm And the same boat as you guys. Right? Like, I'm also selling. So the more that we can can get from these deals, the more we can squeeze out or if we sign like, multi contracts. I think there should be accelerators around that as well. Yeah. Now I'm definitely happy to kind bring that up in our next like, leadership meeting and kind of talk through that. But it is pretty early still. We haven't really, like like, gone above and beyond any of our numbers. And so that's one thing to consider and keep in mind like this is all very fresh for for all of us still. So we need a roll with what we've got for a little bit. And then we can start tweaking as we start accelerating pass some of these numbers and exceeding some of these targets.

Client 3: Sounds good.

Host 2: Yeah. But I love it man. I love it. I love that you guys wanna push fast it and And And Yeah. Get as much as possible. That's the reason why you're here, right in sales. Exactly. Cool. Yeah. Man March tells it on. But here's the thing. So Yeah. I wanna talk about this too. So the the whole Sdr thing One, I think easy fix that we can fix right away is is that the meeting link thing. Right, like, when Sdr sdr is actually setting up or booking the meeting. They should be using our Zoom link so that they don't have to be present on the call every time. I don't necessarily think Sc sdr do need to be present on the call every single time. I think it is nice that they can kinda, like, go through listen. But in terms of, like a relationship or a hand off, there's not a ton there already they are primarily booking that meeting you guys should be running and taking it. And then basically controlling that conversation. And then doing all the follow up on your own for the most part. Unless you need additional additional resources are help from the Sdr team.

Client 5: Real quick question.

Client 3: Yeah two?

Client 4: Do and Danny, Please.

Client 4: The demo set calls and the requirements that we have for information to for the Sdr. They don't have any relationship with these people.

Client 4: Know like, it's and two to five minutes of ago. I don't think it's the best idea for the s gerard to be on the call personally.

Client 4: My personal thought is that if an Sdr wants to be a part of that, then they can through listening to the call afterward But my personal opinion is like, there is no real relationship there. If this was like more in analysis more in def qualification, you had Sdr running at Disco or like, a a discovery call prior to the demo.

Client 4: Yeah. That was the case, and it's like, yeah. Let's involved. This is my two cents once again, think about it, take it to leadership. You guys make your decision. My two cents that doesn't really make too much sense to have the Sdr on that call. Unless this is something that's strictly for training purposes, and we wanna see them getting that information if that's the case. I think they get the same training through listing that call and then hitting the ae yep afterward for questions.

Host 2: You know? Yeah. For sure.

Client 4: That's.

Host 2: No. I love that. Just so you had some I was just gonna say in regards to the meetings that they are setting up.

Client 5: That crap... That account criteria that I sent you I like we need to really push for a baseline number because now finding out across a thousand dollars for set up an account, on these account these meetings that are being looked they're very low very low on numbers.

Client 5: And it's not like, realistically that we can do the deal like, yeah, we can close anything but behind all. Wanna be just like around when we just kinda whole bunch of quantity of accounts. Versus quality. Right? And so, like, what I've been noticing a lot lately, has been, like, a lot of meetings being booked. And a lot of deals being put in my pipeline. And out of eighteen, sixteen of those no shows. And it's like, I didn't set that meeting up and coming from an Sql position. It's a lot. It's different if I, like, a five seven meeting up for Topper. And you know, Topper calls that person was like, hey, We had a meeting. They won't know who Topper are gonna know why And so it's like are they following up with these people that are now showing is it just like a once it's in our it's our field it's in our field.

Host 2: Say that again. Just Those like this.

Client 5: So it's like, when I was in Sdr, Right? We would set up the meetings for our Aes. And we was that point of contact like liaison between Ae and that prize meaning if our Ae was to reach out to that person without coming to that initial meeting, They won't know who you are. They'll think they'd show another sales rep. They'll be like, oh, like Yeah. I don't remember talking to you, but I remember talking to such as such. And so when we're trying to like get these meetings reschedule, I keep running into a situation where it's like we get no shows and there's no follow with these people. Because I mean, I'm focused on the accounts. I wanna target.

Client 5: So it's more of a thing of like now it's in my pipeline and the closed date is yesterday, and I'm like, oh, I didn't even know. Because it was just set up, you know, and there was no follow. There was no Nothing That's why I'm asking like, is it. Isn't is it safer to ask like that they specifically go after accounts say, we would want them to target or they give us stuff and then we kind of like, put it on the back end, because right now in Hubspot it's very reorganized to it's like. All these are in my pipeline. I have, like, at least like six note shows, and I don't know how that looks to management if they're looking at it slide is just following up with Kelly phone is oc phone, you know, like, I, I don't even know something be like, I hop on the zoom. Because it's on my calendar. And, you know, like like when was that Wednesday? I had twelve of those. And app ins you know, what we sitting on the car that's, like, a lot of waste of time. So I don't know if that's in the conversation of know, who's following up and, like, with the account criteria here, it looks like but I know that we've all kind of, like, had that same conversation.

Host 2: Yeah. So on this case the Go ahead.

Client 3: I was just gonna say, I remember I don't, Frodo. It was if there was a no show, the Sdr followed up until they showed. Right? And And that makes the most sense because how are they gonna get credit for a meeting that they didn't set Right? Like, if it never showed up and then they're like, oh well, basically, they give you a interested prospect, you know, at that point.

Client 3: And then That is exactly how it should be Yeah.

Client 5: Right right there.

Host 2: Yeah.

Client 4: The just Yeah.

Client 5: Okay Yeah.

Host 2: Every time. Like, I had a no show this week that James set up and James went followed up and, like, got got it back on the hook until he could reschedule the meeting for Tuesday next week. Right. Like know. Again they if they know show, right, to your point, just their made point. Their main point of contact at the time is James or is the Sdr about Kelly whoever might be yeah, It's there responsibility keep on the calendar. Right.

Client 5: So that's what's being disconnected. I don't think that they're... I don't know if they don't know. But, like, it'll be like issue show and then, you know, nothing nothing happens after that. Okay.

Host 2: I just took note on the... Anything else on just on the scheduling side Yeah.

Client 3: I know that as far as follow ups goes with the Sdr and even something like this. Right? Usually, what we would do is say they're in a a sequence You know what I mean or cadences what we call the at demo and the Sdr got they even set up the meeting or whatever. Now there was a no show, if there was a no show, they would go directly into a interested prospect or, like a next step sequence, by that Sdr to be nurtured until they're back on the line. Right? So now we're gonna have like, a set amount of steps like a set process that they go through to nurture these interested prospects. Until we get them back on the hook. And And so I think that's like, really important. But right now, the way that it's set up, is they have to they have a super complicated process of filtering and going through tasks because they have seven hundred tasks rather than a manageable pipeline And so I think the blue problem here is let's create a manageable pipeline and that could be partially done through you know, partnering with Aes and then maybe backfill filling with, you know, some of mark's lists, but we have to make sure that it's manageable and I know that for each Sdr that that pipeline number is different. So I wouldn't say that, you know, it's the same for everybody. But I think focusing more on the qualification piece or in training the Sdr around, like, what types of sites we wanna go for and such like that is gonna be really important because, like, Frodo Saying there has been a ton of waste of time even and follow up for sub ten thousand dollar accounts. And, like, with a quota like, one point five million. It's like wire we even and spending time on that whatsoever.

Host 2: Yeah And the reason the reason why the quota is what it is and then it's set for quarterly is so that you guys can have proactive follow up with bigger. Counts. I know that they take longer longer to close.

Host 2: Right? So if I start I a deal cycle. Like, yesterday, Had a call. Our first call was lonely ghost. I know it's probably getting close by the end of the month and that's even too like a warm contact of warm lead I know someone that works there Right? So it's, like And I and I can... Because there's contracts involved not like route where they could just sign up and then go month to month. Anytime there's a and an Msa involved, they have to involve know, handful more people. So it's not gonna be as straightforward as just downloaded the app completing the implementation they're live. There's more steps There's gonna be red lining in that process. Gonna have special requests. Right? So So even a deal like that, right, it's warm. It's not exactly cold it's gonna probably take the full month to close. So with these bigger deals, and that that's potentially, you know, four hundred to five hundred thousand dollar a year deal, but at the same time, you guys need the time to follow with them. As your pipeline expands, like, I look in Hubspot and I just filter one of you guys, Right? You already have a decent number of deals in the pipeline. But as we look at these deals and the quality of them, and they're likelihood of closing once the contract been sent out, like, there's still a lot sitting in there. Right. So Your guys ability to manage your pipeline, it's gonna be crucial. So that all this wasted time that we're trying to, like, figure out, hey, what's the best way to to kind of help the Sdr that's one thing that we can iron out. Monday, Ra, we'll have Mark on our meeting on Monday. Go through the Sdr changes that we wanna make and then we'll implement a solution pretty quickly because ultimately, we don't have a lot time to waste outside of the time we've already wasted.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 3: K. Cool. Handled Asap. And then once we once we're all on the same page, then we can all just you know, it's off the races. We could just run our around.

Host 2: Yeah. And we might not it, like, might not get to play where all. Where we're all on the same page Right? Like, there still might be some back and forth. But ultimately, there needs to be some change to happen. Because right, like, Frodo si closing multiple deals that are smaller right, banks jewelry, smaller deal, you know, I'm spending a lot of time just facilitating getting that deal done by a year with Sarah, and they're, like five grand. Right? If that over the year. Right? So it's doesn't it makes sense for us to close those deals. Especially with some of the targets that we have set forth from Matt capital. So I totally grandma on board. Need to figure out How really... Good way to go about this and then make sure that what we implement is sticky and that we actually can measure results from from that proposed solution that we come up with. Otherwise, it's just gonna be It's just gonna be chaos. So Cool it already is chaos.

Client 3: So I think we can only just add a little bit more order to this.

Host 2: It anyways... We just need a little... We need some garlic guard protection Yes Cool.

Host 2: K. Yeah. Because Danny and I've seen a lot of, like, what works at Route didn't work at route. And I think there's a lot that we can learn from there and then you guys obviously have experience at other places. And so The more that we can come together just formulate something that works. The better. So next steps, Monday, we're gonna meet again, for our Ae stand up, let's make sure that cloth dates are up to date on our our deals currently in pipeline. And then and then we'll transfer through deals a little bit more then. And then we'll chat through our proposed plan. So Frodo Simon, like, if you guys can meet with me either Monday morning or a little later this afternoon. If you've got a little bit time, let's go through that doc. And then let's put together a little bit more of a a structure that we can present with Mark. On Monday.

Client 3: Sounds good. And to back it up for the... Sdr is taking notes. Just in the meantime, while while my hands messed up. Is it okay if I have them required to be on the calls?

Host 2: Yeah Yeah. Cool. Everyone god bless. Have a great weekend. Rest up and we'll see you on Monday.

Client 3: Sounds good. See you symbol.

Host 2: Thanks Two again
