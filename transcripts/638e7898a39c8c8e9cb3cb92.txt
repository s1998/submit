Client 1: And not using a lot of tools. Whether that's like whatsapp Slack. Teams Google and there's so many tools. So we helped them consolidate and use one system one tool. That being Zoom. Zoom recently also. We also launched calendar as well as a male application to help you know, just, you know, kind of compete in that space.

Client 1: Coming for almost four and a half years now.

Host 2: And and i'm sir what what's your title that's?

Client 1: My what?

Host 2: You're title. What what are you like, an the account executive?

Client 1: Sales manager, sales manager.

Host 2: Got it. And and tell me more other people dot Ai, What what what do you use it for?

Client 1: People dot Ai helps me manage my team by looking at different attributes, I guess, that lead to meeting objectives. So one of the things that I look at on my team is the number of emails that are sent out. And number of phone calls that are being made. So it gives you me a visual my team's productivity. And then I can tie the outcomes to some of the things that People dot Ai able to show me It's like a data visualization tool I'm I'm having a bit of a hard time visualizing.

Host 2: It. Would you be comfortable sharing your trained to to show us what that looks like.

Client 1: Not on my computer right now.

Host 2: Oh, it's good. So... Okay. So people the today ai shows you basically what your comes up to, like, the emails the same, the dials they make the the most they make and then they tie those to outcomes like closed one or close the us, basically, is that the idea?

Client 1: No. It doesn't show closed loss or close. One it shows my team a visual Almost like a bar. I guess, like, graph And based on their activities that you know, my organization deemed import. So assuming someone at the higher end. Maybe my Cro or Ceo they set what's important in terms of productivity from my. And we're able to see each ae contribution to these items. So the things that my companies selected are email sent. Phone calls made. And zoom meetings made. And I can see in one view what my team has done for the week or months or quarter. So it's it's all, like, visualize based on those k. But based on those metrics, how many emails they're sending. So for example, like, I have like an ae that's this week, you know, like last week, think you can see how many calls they made or how many emails they have sent out. I'm assuming it it it ties into their inbox. And other things about to be on my computer in a minute, but, you know, right now i'm not But that that's kinda how I assume it it it shows you. It shows it based on the inbox or Zoom platform itself like it integrates with it because it'll show how out their being Got it.

Host 2: Okay. So it's pretty... It's really a tool till the productivity of salespeople people then.

Client 1: Yeah. Exactly.

Host 2: And what do you do with this information?

Client 1: I use it as a map, to figure out who need to focus on in terms of feedback and coaching as a manager. Let's say, like, hey, you're currently lowest and email sent on a team And it looks like it's contributing to let's just say, you know, low sales. You know? so that's to be one thing that we look at. And to look at it as a overall forecasting. Aid So I can see how many of my teammates peers are also using the, you know, having the same level activity, but maybe their results are better or my results are better. So it's a good assessment. Guys like that myself be be avenue new forecast.

Host 2: What what when is the last time that you used to people that they are hello?

Client 1: You still there?

Host 2: Yeah. You're you're cutting up a little bit can you hear us.

Client 1: Yep. Changing Wifi right now.

Host 2: Yeah. When is the last time that you used people dot Ai Last week, on Tuesday.

Host 2: Got it. So you do you use it how often and Ro speaking? Do you use it?

Client 1: Weekly.

Host 2: Weekly. In what context?

Client 1: What do you mean my wall contacts?

Host 2: Like, do you do you have, like, a block here on your calendar open it told do you ever... Is it like, every to the morning? Like, And do you do you use an app or like a web side, or do you use, like, email alerts to single sign on.

Client 1: Hang on. Let me let me show you. I can show you now. Let's see. How do I Let i out that background. Hang on. I no idea how to turn off that background. Hang on. Trying to figure out.

Host 2: People still Oh.

Host 2: Trying to got it. Okay? Yep.

Client 1: Okay. So like right here.

Host 2: Can you can you tell it to randomly you next get? Yep. Beautiful. No.

Client 1: Okay. Alright here. Leader board. External activities. And the activities are meetings, emails, calls, And obviously, Like right now, there's no data to display, but Right here emails, cause meetings the next seven days. How often my reps are responding create my goals So there's a lot of insights there, you know, just based on on my team, and what things we're tracking. Right? So very useful.

Host 2: I see. And so again, like, how How are you using it on on last on two like? Do you just open it weekly like have like a blocker on your calendar, How does and I don't have a block.

Client 1: I mean, it's it's really just a matter of going in there grabbing what I need. And then maybe before one on one. With teammate. Like, I need to see, like, what... Okay, How productive are you being? Like, what? Where you spending your time. And then using that not necessarily as micro management tool, but more as they Let's open up a dialogue.

Client 1: Right. Let's put up with i log. Let's see the results. Talk to me about your results. From accountability perspective, here's what I'm seeing. People dot dot ai. Use that you know, five hours, ten hours of your time and meetings, approximately ten hours in emails you know, that that sort of guide. Is more of a of a tool is not necessarily I'm looking at this every day. Because at the end of the day, this is just one this is one component of many tools that we use. Right? So this is I don't know how to put it in perspective. It's It's it's very much needed. It's it's almost like something you're putting in your back pack when you go hiking, you know, it's not gonna be the fire it's not gonna be the food But tools that you bring out as needed. So to answer your question before one on one or before the leadership meeting, weekly.

Host 2: Did you use people that Ai or similar solutions at your previous companies?

Client 1: We used outreach So how the you...

Host 2: What you would like other Tubes.

Client 1: Yes.

Host 2: How did they compare?

Client 1: People Ai is more of a data of the data is station tour outreach has more features that allow the user to implement. Actions. So it has something called tasks. In a task you can create it. And actually execute the item. So you can actually call out to a prospect or email to a prospect within the tool. Peoples dot Ai is more of a management tool. And the reps themselves don't. Use it As a manager would be helpful to have something in there that allows us to set up coaching or feedback insights. Because again, like I mentioned before, this is more of a tool that gives you information as a manager, but doesn't really allow you to have anything actionable. You know, to tie it other than you know, deals, for example, I can go in here and you know, see my upcoming meetings, you know, but it'd be helpful to maybe have some kind of ro acts of of my conversations with my Aes I'm sure.

Host 2: But I'm a bit confused. Are we talking about Alt outreach top but people do They ai here.

Client 1: People dot dot ai So you're you're saying it it'd be useful to have more actionable insights on how you'll folks may improve.

Client 1: Yeah. Like the note, Like, something that I can take notes with.

Host 2: What kind of insight you have examples of what you have in mind here?

Client 1: I could just say like, hey, my eight my last conversation with my wrap here we talked about spending more time here. This seems to be an increase in trend and emails, decreased trend meetings, Next step would be to talk about how we can increase their time spent and meetings. For example, like, leave that note somewhere. Right now, I'm just... kind of doing that via notes.

Client 1: Like Google Notes or task and other tools. But if there was something that lived in the actual I that'd be helpful.

Host 2: Right. Got it. So you would really... You would want people dot Ai to act as like a sort of like, full stack coaching tool.

Host 2: Well, again track of the feedback you've given and and how the person is is is is doing on this got.

Client 1: Yes.

Client 1: That.

Host 2: What all your favorite things about people that Ai?

Client 1: I like the leader board aspect I think it there's a visual of how I compared to my peers. There's also a visual on trans you know, like, there's rankings. You can see you know, different people's metrics So, for example, right here. Like, this is a team member, another account executive like, they're they're number one, So this is useful so I can have a point to my teammates I said like, hey, I we we're not comparing here, but we put a perspective We have individuals here that are contributing almost you know, a couple more than you are. Let's talk about how we can you know, modify or even get some time with these individuals. So single visibility into other Teams that we are under the same company is useful. I also like the analytics where we can look at a feed of live changes into the deals. So there's an opportunity that we're looking at. We can see you know, upcoming meetings and things that to focus on this week. So for example, like, I can see to this week, you know, we have a conference call. You know, for for this deal internal conference call with who's all involved and we can click on there and it it it should be able to take us to the opportunity. Right here. It's like as I say, configuration. But, usually, there's, like a link here, we can click it and it'll take us to Salesforce. And it'll show us what that's what that's tied to. So that's use That's useful home perspective. I i can click here stay in one window. And I'll have to keep Salesforce open, but I can go back and tie into the opportunity we're talking about.

Host 2: That makes sense. You like you like the, you mentioned that little bull shows you how you compare to your peers. Like, as a manager, Yeah.

Client 1: We yeah we can see different teams.

Host 2: Got it. So it it shows you, like not only individual level performance, but also team level performance.

Client 1: Yes. I can do custom teams here. And right now, I'm not sure if there's other Not sure what's going on right now is people Ai, but but, yeah, we can click here and check other managers teams out.

Host 2: Anything that you don't like about the call the ai.

Client 1: Like, right now. I'm not sure what exactly going on, but sometimes when the start of the week, There's no data. So i just defaults to But it seems like it It likes to look at things on a weekly basis. I'm i'm not sure if there is a setting for it, but it would be nice to see the previous day and, you know, because that would show us more smaller chunk.

Client 1: Of time because this is by default weekly, date range of data. Which is great. I mean, but if we're on a Monday, I'm not really looking at this week. I'm looking at either last week or Friday you know, just as a whole. So it would be useful to change this part to, like, you know, just single days, I guess, like, just short like today, you know? So stuff like that and And then I would say, again, just going back to what I mentioned before. There's good things that you can pull from here, but there's nothing that I can use to actually stay in the tool and log my notes. It's more of just kind of like I mentioned before, you use that as a part of your conversation, but he'll be good if the conversation lived in here and maybe for the wraps like, for my Aes, if there is something as well here, I can assign to them and say, hey, like, review this, you know, or take note of that. Other than that What else? Yeah. Times it has his outages. I'm not sure if that's... our thing or not, but sometimes the data is not There's been concerns sometimes about the data that being poured not being accurate. So more information on where this data is being pulled. So has been concerns about that. So there's not a lot of visibility into the sources. So it'd be good to have some more transparency around that.

Host 2: You mentioned you would like to look at the data on a like, on a daily basis, but I as such mentioned that you were looking at the data on a weekly basis. Like, every week.

Client 1: Yeah. That's true.

Host 2: Got it. So Because mean...

Client 1: Because it's once a week. So Right?

Client 1: That one day, you know, It's like... Just give me the brief on the summary on the previous day.

Host 2: Does people Ai send you any email for about insights with your teams activity.

Client 1: Believe so. Who's see here.

Host 2: So in any event it doesn't sound like you you consume them or or that they'll be useful no, I don't.

Client 1: and actually go on the tool Yeah.

Client 1: It does... I me a daily digest by They stopped doing that. Last one I got was last year. This is what it looks like.

Host 2: Yeah. And... I'm sorry. I asked you previously but I didn't get sales. So you you used to use Outreach. So outreach provides the kind of a productivity is that right?

Client 1: Yes.

Host 2: And and and what all the pros cons of outreach versus people ai.

Client 1: Outreach has the email and call mechanisms built in, So if we have an opportunity if we have a deal and the contact details are updated within outreach, my Aes can actually make that call make that email. Make it happen. In people at i Ai. It's visualization, so I can just see the emails c the next steps can actually do that. And as a manager, I can also take the actionable ball steps in outreach, So I can create a task. And say, hey, This is a deal. Entire priority. My Ae hasn't reached out. Make a note of it and their next one on one. So I can i can I him leave a task for myself. In in outreach. I mean, sorry. And people at i ai that doesn't exist.

Host 2: So might I get like, we... Which of those do you prefer between outreach and and people that They ai like I mentioned before, you know, that they're different tools.

Client 1: I think people our Ai a high level view of where the business is going from Like, if you wanna look at the ocean, right?

Client 1: Mean you use sonar or whatever. Right? But if you are just looking at a sub part of the ocean, you you actually go out there right and you can dive into it. Right? But so I think people at Ia ai is more of the sonar.

Host 2: Know, it's like not really specific.

Client 1: An outreach is that diving part of it. You know. So from a manager perspective, a front manager. So I I see the I see the reason of people at I ai, I think in our organization we use it. From a executive level, you know, the executives are looking at that. Frontline manager like me, I maybe just you know, lance at it. Like, that's why I said, I only look at it weekly. I'm actually making the things happen. So I think you know, They have differences not necessarily I prefer outreach or prefer People at Dot ai, but in my opinion, I use more... I would use more outreach. My... I would use that daily in my opinion. Versus people I i ai, I use it weekly.

Host 2: Why wouldn't you use that for dating?

Client 1: I would use Outreach daily because it has that ability to have those actionable next steps and yeah know, I can because... I can have my my notes from my conversations in there. As opposed to people dot I ai. Okay. I look at it. Get some data and move monday Right.

Host 2: Yeah. Yeah. Are you aware of any other solutions in the market that similar to people that ai It's not not not the same the same one thing that comes to mind is Cla, use clear before.

Client 1: And then another tool that we have used is Tableau, which are all I i guess data visualization to an extent? Cla, is more of similar to people dot Ai in my opinion, except it doesn't look at the person It looks like the opportunities for potential deals, that are fed into it And It's like an air steroids. But it's really machine learning involved as well. It shows you the probability of certain deals that are gonna close. Which has proved to be pretty accurate, But again, so it's just a different approach to measuring productivity.

Host 2: Which one do you prefer between these two approaches? The one that's like doesn't sent previous support new and Break That's good point.

Client 1: A again as a frontline manager I would use Query more often just because that mean It it depends on the seasonality. I think towards the end of the quarter, like, for example, if we are in January and our quarter ends in January and, you know, towards the end of January. I probably spend more time in cla because the deals are important, but if we're talking about planning in general management. People that I'd spend more time in people Dot ai because I wanna sure I'm having the right conversations with my team and based on they're activities where where they're spending their time. Time management. So I think it's relevant to the to the time frame of of where we're at in our goal. So, like, if we don't have a lot of time. And we need We have a big gap in dev and revenue. I'm gonna be spending more time in cla. I wanna look at the big deals you know, doing okay and not you know, I'm with the rest of the team and Quota looking attainable. And maybe I have new people on my team that I'm very concerned about their performance. And I need a gauge to understand the benchmark where everyone else and the company is, and I'll probably spend more time in people dot Ai.

Host 2: Right? I know a lot time, but this has been a very useful conversation Thank you so much for your time today.

Client 1: Of course. Anytime. I appreciate y'all reaching out and luck was slow. Give me updated. I'm I'm very curious to to hear about all comes out. Of flow.

Host 2: Also. Yeah. Great to meet you. Alright. That's it.

Client 1: And then what do we do about the payment.

Host 2: Oh, I'll my assistant will reach out like an Amazon gift card. I hope that's okay?

Client 1: Oh, we discussed Paypal, I believe.

Host 2: Oh, yeah. I mean, Yeah. If we did then, that's fine too.

Client 1: Okay. Cool. That's no problem. Thank you so much.

Host 2: Thank you so much. Bye.

Client 1: Bye.

Host 2: To the next one.

Host 3: Are we just staying in here.

Host 2: Yep. It's like it a light Howdy Howdy you?

Host 2: Nice to meet you you. Nice to meet you as well. How are you doing?

Client 4: Better than I deserve, It's a good day for a Monday. We'll take it.

Host 2: Better than you deserve. Wow. It's this that's quite a statement.

Client 4: It's a batch phrase from a financial adviser that's popular where I grew up. So it it's kinda stuck with me.

Host 2: Like it. It is... It is sketchy. Well, it's it's great to me to where we're all you're coming problem.

Client 4: I am calling in from Salt lake City Utah.

Host 2: Oh, great. Awesome. It's a beautiful area there. It's gonna be crazy over there.

Client 4: Yes. We got about seven inches here in the valley last night of snow and it hasn't gotten above four to degrees today.

Host 2: So... Alright.

Host 2: Well, you at I am in the location.

Host 2: I mean, miami florida enough. Where to it's a nice seventy five right now.

Client 4: That's pretty nice up there. And what about you, Enrique? Where are you?

Host 5: I'm in Toronto. It's also around forty. So pretty cool.

Client 4: I love Toronto. Go maple believes.

Host 5: Yeah.

Client 4: And Blue jays.

Host 2: Awesome. Well, thanks again Careful taking the time. So but by your way of introduction. Well, the team of had tim flow. And so these days we're looking into building actually making parades into the sales enable implement in the sales tooling industry. And so we're basically doing a ton of market result in trying to wrap heads around the industry and the kind of like big players and the big jobs to be done. And we found about people ai, and I I believe I found your name on g to connect review the that people Ai. So, yeah, I mean, it's really just us looking to chat people Ai, how you use it what you like what you don't like and going on in two pools. Perhaps we can kick it off with... Can you give us a little bit more about What what do you do and what does your company do?

Client 4: Certainly. So my name is Micah Platt. I'm an enterprise account executive for a company called Plural site. We are a tech training and skills development company. have an online platform that Does everything from basic soft skills to deep software development as well as cloud certification for Azure, Aws, Gcp, things of that nature. So companies engage us by access to our platform form, give it to people and they're able to take their, you know, knowledge from very basic too extremely advanced.

Host 2: Alright. Plural sites the the the the name diff rings a bill, It's a pretty big one. Right? How do you though you guys?

Client 4: We have about three thousand employees and we've been We went public a few years ago and then we're actually acquired by Vista Equity.

Host 2: So...

Client 4: they pulled us back out of the public market. So we're a private equity company now.

Host 2: How did that go? That acquisition?

Client 4: I mean, for the end user me, at the bottom of the tote pole, it went very well.

Host 2: So... Hey. I'm I'm glad do here.

Client 4: Guaranteed prices on stock is always a good thing.

Host 2: Right?

Host 2: Thing. Yeah. I guess, I guess it takes one of the major distractions of operating in the public company, which is a price. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Tell about the people that yeah. What what do you use it for So I've been I'm fairly young when it comes into the technology space So I'll give a little more background there.

Client 4: I started in the business development space. So similar to what... It looks like Enrique or maybe Brendan are doing finding people. And we didn't have a great tool for that. I left plural site for a little while and was out in the wilderness I joke. But I was with two other companies as an enterprise seller. And then came back and we had added people Ai once I came back in the enterprise space here at plural site. And we utilize it primarily for two reasons. One to see if our activity within an opportunity merits continuation of that opportunity. So that means are they engaging with us? They responding to us are we doing our job sellers engaging with the prospect enough. We we all know that, you know, time kills all deals, that's something that people always talk about. I think we understand that piece of it. I'm not trying to hide anything there, but If I don't talk to you for two, three days, I'm starting to get worried as a seller. And that's that's one thing that we utilize people Ai four. It does a good job of keeping us on track. But we also see it for just our normal prospecting activity. Are we sending enough emails? Are we using enough of our social links are we making enough phone calls within our territory. Because it's it is a numbers game. Yes, you need to be more strategic and targeted like, I engaged with you flow because I'm assuming this was probably ghost written, but it was very well done. Like you you found me you were curious about why I did what I did, like, you engaged. It wasn't just a slap an email. You know? It was very well done. And we need to do that, but you still need to send probably fifty to a hundred emails per every response. Yeah. And that's what we use it for.

Host 2: That it that make sense. How's it going? How about what do you think of people ai?

Client 4: It's good. The problem is there's Everybody's trying to fix just one problem. Because if you look at the competitors, like, we utilize Gong, we utilize... We had a visa for a while. People i basically replace it. Outreach we still use Salesforce hypothetically was going to be able to give us this data. Like, there's there's always been a problem as to where you use it and how to get this information. Like, is Micah the seller?

Client 4: Doing the things he needs to do to find and close more deals. And it feels like they're still not the right answer somewhere. Know, I like people Ai, but I have to dedicate time there. I also spend time in a a company called demand base to see if our marketing stuff is resonating with companies So it's there's not a good answer. And I feel like I run around in circles with all of these different products.

Host 2: Interesting. What other products did you use? So you mentioned Gong People Ai out reach syllables demand base, days.

Host 2: What's that?

Client 4: Demand base is have you heard of six sense or basically, it's it's tracking activity within accounts. So if I send out a link on my Linkedin or a white paper, I can then parse it down by my segment and see if there's a company that people are looking at my my posts.

Client 4: As well as our marketing. So just very high level. I work with a couple of airlines. So I know for a fact that this one airline is interested it in one of our products because we have fifty people come through our marketing material. And it shows up in demand base.

Host 2: I see. So it's really for like, account based marketing.

Client 4: Yep.

Host 2: That makes sense. Of all these products gong to Ai are reached man base. We which of those is most important to you.

Client 4: For me, outreach because I'm an acquisition. So I have no existing customer mers. And so I have to quickly get a lot of information out to a lot of people. So outreach is most important I would argue people Ai is second when it comes to Am I doing the right activities within an account or an opportunity? So I can quickly pull it up and show to my boss. Hey. I talked to fourteen different people this week within this account, trying to get this deal forward. I validated my existence.

Host 2: I'm sorry. You why is outreach to such a big deal flow?

Client 4: Outreach automate my tasks so I can create an email campaign, a phone call campaign or a linkedin campaign and I can use some it's it's a more sophisticated mail merge. To put it simply. So I can send that out. It cycles it. It makes it looks like a human ascending it every time So right.

Host 2: Makes sense? What what do you like best about people Ai?

Client 4: I like the high level. They keep changing the interface but I do like the high level. It's it's like every you know, customer facing tool every sas. The toolbar change every month it seems. But I do like the high level I activity, I can quickly see, like, On Monday morning, how did I do last week? Did I miss something? Do I need to dig back down? And then I pull it on my each of my opportunities I juggle about twenty to thirty opportunities at a time, and I can stack those opportunities on my x axis and see what my activity is on my y axis. So, you know, is this big deal that I think is gonna save my year? Am I spending enough time there? Do I have one email to the the Ceo hoping he's gonna buy for me? Right? So that's what I like about it.

Host 2: Can you when is the last time that you use Ai?

Client 4: This morning Can you walk me through with what you did there?

Client 4: Log would you be comfortable sharing your screen actually or is that overly?

Client 4: I I think I wouldn't be comfortable doing that. I don't wanna share my territory.

Host 2: I'm not sure right.

Client 4: So... I'm helping you out. I get it. I don't know how much I can share.

Host 2: It's all good. Absolutely. I I I don't need to to pry. Okay. You used it this morning. Can you can you walk me through what you did there?

Client 4: So every Monday we submit our forecast for the following week, what opportunities are doing well, what's going to close either this month or this quarter. Our quarter ends the end of December. So it's like, all hands on deck. So I pulled up my forecast tool, which we utilize ana plan on one screen, and then I pulled up People dot ai on this other screen. And I saw that I have three opportunities that are slated to close here in December. And I pulled just those three up over here on people dot i. As I'm forecasting, I'm seeing if I'm getting the responses that I need that mirror what I'm hoping to get done this quarter. And so that was the first step. And then the second step, I pulled it out the view to a more macro to see did I do enough last week? Post Thanksgiving, you know, Thanksgiving week was a pretty light activity as far phone calls and emails. I'm not gonna waste time calling somebody Wednesday hours as they're traveling to grandma's house. But the week after did I double my efforts, and I was able to see that.

Host 2: I see.

Client 4: So kind of hold myself accountable. That's how I utilize it.

Host 2: Got it You mentioned that you have to send forecasts every week to... I I assume your manager Yep.

Client 4: To a manager and then she rolls it up. Tomorrow will go to rv vp, and then Wednesday gets to the c suites.

Host 2: Thing real dumb question here, but is that typical of of of sales teams is, like a typical process.

Client 4: Very typical especially as you start to grow. So we have We have our Smb segment is more automated online. We have our commercial segments we have our enterprise and then a strategic segment. So there are twenty five managers each with between five and ten people on their team So it all has to kind of cluster together up for your forecast. So What kind of action does the management chain date based on that forecast?

Client 4: I can share that there's a potential risk in an opportunity and ask for their help. And they may bring in either a solutions engineer, or bring in somebody in the c suite that may know somebody over there. I work with the Fortune fifty customers, so I'm working with fairly large organizations. And it's sometimes it's a matter of who you know in those organizations. So we'll send out you know, a flare gun asking for help. Anybody know anybody over here? You know, that kind of thing. Or it could be a headache with procurement. Maybe our legal team is you know, say this is the line in the sand, we won't change this term. But it's a million dollar deal. Maybe we could get enough leverage to get our legal team to agree to it. You know, that kind of thing.

Client 4: Yeah. And so with the forecast and that risk and what's potentially coming in Those are the action items my leader will take.

Host 2: I see. You... So you do you use it every week every day?

Client 4: People Ai, I use probably two three times a week. I used it every Monday. I'm probably the heaviest user on Mondays. And then Wednesdays, I typically look at it again as I get ready for I have a one on one with my manager every week, and that's Thursday mornings. So Wednesday, I double check. Helps me prepare what I'm sharing for my one on one.

Host 2: Is that a roughly typical usage in team.

Client 4: Yes. Definitely that's very typical for and end of sales executive What do you dislike about people Ai if anything It still doesn't track all your activity.

Client 4: That's the joy of everything like Salesforce doesn't show If I make a call for my cell phone or if somebody texts me, you know... There's just no way there's no good way and I'm not gonna log a text that I get at ten o'clock at night saying, hey, I just this like, I'm not gonna put that in a Crm. I'm not gonna take time to do that. So matter how good your tracking is. There's always a percentage that gets missed.

Host 2: Right. Interesting.

Client 4: And I don't want it to integrate, like, I don't want to integrate with Twitter or my socials like it's had enough that everything feels like big brother is watching.

Client 4: Not that there's anything to hide, but I just don't wanna give that much access.

Host 2: I understand. I mean, honestly, me, I'm I'm discovering this whole will of sales that I blown the away that there is so expectation of privacy Like I I come from the world of engineering, like, engineers do not like.

Host 2: No.

Client 4: That's.

Host 2: Yeah. I'm actually interested because all the like dire solutions on sale like, Solutions are there that you don't use your personal cell phone for like like, text and and and and phone calls Right.

Client 4: And I do use outreach, but I still my email signature, I have my cell phone because of my laptops closed or off, and it could be the most simple of questions I don't wanna miss a million dollar deal because they have just a simple question Perfect example, somebody bought a thousand licenses for our platform. And they were like, what if and it was... They were going to just go ahead and sign up they were worried. They were like, well, do I have to buy a new seat if I fire somebody and hire somebody to replace them. That's typical in some of our the products out there. Some of our competitors do make you pay per person every time. But we allow about ten percent rotation. So if you have a lay or if somebody quits, you don't have to buy a new license for somebody that quit just replace their seat. But what if they didn't want to move forward with us, Like, This one worked, but I will always get my cell phone number because my income over half of my income is dependent on commissions. That's another different perspective. That's why I give up that expectation of privacy. Closing that thousand seat deal is the difference stream. My kids Christmas and not. So I will always get my cell phone number out. Some people don't, but I always will, and I've been very successful because I am more transparent, And what why doesn't outreach have an app you can install that you would receive this gold from your phone?

Client 4: Same thing you could do it, but that's just another step another layer of connection And same thing our customers, once they finally once we're working closely together with them they also put us in, like, a safe space.

Client 4: Like, give us their private number and we you know, you can communicate k very quickly that way. Like, I've sent people texts with the link to the Doc sign because i like hey. I can't find the link where you just send it. Then they sign it on their phone.

Host 2: Yep. Are you aware of other solutions out there in the market competing with people Ai.

Client 4: Some that are similar. I know a Visa is in that realm, but nothing that's right as nothing that does exactly what it people Ai does.

Client 4: I think Salesforce... I believe tried to do that in track activity. But, yeah, I'm I'm not aware of something that's really exactly like people ai.

Host 2: Have you heard of Cla?

Client 4: Cla, I've seen the name before. I don't know what they do.

Host 2: Yeah. My my understanding is the the very similar. I'm actually bit confused because my understanding was that Cla is different people that Cla shows you level views and people Ai, like it's more like people they views. You're describing to. Sounds like the way you're using people Ai is very much a new centric.

Client 4: Yes. I can look at both I can look at people level as well as opportunity on business level.

Host 2: You can also look at people labeled in people Ai.

Client 4: Mh So I can pull up a single individual and see my communication back and forth with them.

Host 2: Sorry. I meant, like, salesperson level, like you can see people's activities. Can you do that?

Client 4: Yes. I can look at just Micah platt and see what my activity is.

Host 2: And can you can you also look at the colleague activity?

Client 4: If I'm on a team, yes, I can look at my team. So everybody under my manager we can see and track ourselves together. But I can't see other people's teams. That's how our permissions are set up Got it.

Host 2: Is that wheel that you can see your your team's activity?

Client 4: No. It's same thing. The culture of sales we like that leader board. We like that Gong.

Client 4: Right. We like to a sale a sale. I got another sale. Let's it's how we're wired. And so it's very different. I'm very close a lot of people in the software engineering world That's like don't ask them how many lines of code they wrote. Just ask did it work. You know, did you solve a solution and they might not even want to share how they solve the solution. They're like, it's done. You know?

Client 4: It's it's different where salespeople like I don't know why we're wired this way. We're like, yes. I did this thing and I want everyone to see how amazing I am.

Host 2: interesting.

Client 4: And stack ranking salespeople love it. That's why we have President's club, That's why you have end of quarter in incentives. I we love to brag that we got these plastic trophies that cost two dollars say that I was better than everyone else. It's the weirdest thing.

Host 2: As there's initially dumb questions, but like do salespeople often get filed because of what, like, people find out on Yeah.

Client 4: Yeah. What they find out on, like, social media?

Host 2: No. No. On people ai. Like, like, just generally, like the Will your manager come to you best basically. Top my friend like, hey, you'll not singing enough activity here.

Client 4: Hundred percent hundred percent. First, So that's the other weird thing. Results are the most important thing for a salesperson.

Client 4: Alright. So I'm closing a million dollars a month, they don't care what I'm doing. You know, like, I'm walking on water. They just love me. If you're not closing what you're supposed to that's when they start looking at your activity. And yes. A performance improvement plan or a pip First thing that it was like your activity, You haven't closed anything for six months. You haven't sold anything. The reason you're here is to sell something, what's going on? And if you're not doing your activity, you're gone.

Host 2: Like, gun like you mean need like to sometimes immediately.

Client 4: Because that's why I try to be very proactive every week. I'm like, this is what I've done. Like, it's also protecting me. I'm showing my leader Yeah. I struggled. November was tough for me. I did okay, but it wasn't my best month I was able to show all the activity I did. I'm like, this is where the fruits came in. So it's almost protecting me having it there. Where some people are afraid to show their activity because paint some in a bad light. Interesting.

Host 2: Great. I think this is pretty all my questions about... Oh, you mentioned Gong What what do you think of Gong I like gong.

Client 4: They have an interesting Ai and machine learning inside of it that will track the activities that you're doing. So it records your meeting and it'll it can even pull out that you're setting next steps with your customer. It helps remind you to, like, get those next steps on the calendar. I always review it too because you're constantly talking in this conversation, like, You need to review what you said sometimes. Because they could throw fifty questions at and you're doing your best to answer them. You know? And so when I do my recap email or a phone call. Which is just good sales practice. I always try and go through and answer all those questions again. So I I love that tool.

Host 2: Interesting. Does Gong. I because I'm wondering Gong could even like Right. That's for deputy email for you.

Client 4: That would be cool if it could. I'm sure it could pull out certain subjects, but I don't know if the I don't know if them algorithm or whatever tool they're using to pull out that those data points is smart up to know what it is.

Host 2: Yeah. Yeah.

Client 4: Because then you're getting into voice recognition, like, are we setting a meeting for the twenty eighth of November? And if I have a heavy boss i and might not understand me.

Host 2: So you'd be surprised. It's it's it's pretty getting better.

Host 2: Yeah. It's coming. It's coming together. It does your bezels use gong to review your?

Client 4: Yes. Yes. I send him over quite frequently and ask for feedback and coaching.

Host 2: So you do that proactively.

Client 4: I do. Yes. But they have access to look at all of them.

Host 2: And what kind of feedback do you receive about goals?

Client 4: I am two? I guess you could say that.

Client 4: I'm overly positive.

Host 2: Like I like y energy, but Okay. So you'll...

Client 4: I get that a lot. I'm overly positive. Even if I'm getting bad news, it still sends like good news. But I have a tendency to lack patients.

Client 4: So you have done a phenomenal job asking questions and letting me answer them. I have a hard time on the flip side, and sometimes in sales, it's more important to listen. You know, my grandpa used to say that we were born with two years in one mouth we should listen accordingly.

Host 2: Yep. Yeah. Gong gives you these metrics. Like the station still like do those manual to you? Do you actually look at them?

Client 4: They do. The patients I've definitely keyed in on, and then customer stories If you have asked the appropriate question or have a good enough rapport, your customers will start to share longer and longer stories and that's usually indicative of trust as well as getting to the right solution.

Host 2: Something that Gong exposes to you and the customer stories.

Client 4: How long it's how long that customer is speaking?

Host 2: So it's kinda like the, like, the customer And so the terrific monologue.

Client 4: Yeah.

Host 2: And so the room doesn't the for the customer. And I assume that like the For you, the wheels.

Client 4: Right Exactly.

Client 4: Interesting. If I'm sitting here trying to pull information out and you're not even you're giving me guess no. Yes, no. Yes, no. That was a bad call.

Host 2: Yeah. Yep. What else does does gong expose to you?

Client 4: I think that's about it. So it gives action items. It says next step, it has a call broken into different segments. So it does, like, the introduction It has the conversation has the questions it has potential next steps. I don't think it's set up, like solution development or you know, it does show screens, potential demonstration. But I think that's about all it its surfaces.

Host 2: Is that useful to you that segment Yeah.

Client 4: The same thing, If I have a thirty minute call and I spent ten minutes you know, goof around saying hi, talking about thanksgiving. Maybe not the best use of my time.

Host 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll well well looking again, like what kind of wrapping our heads right now, the industry we're looking into a lot of these different value props, but I think the one player actually closest to it is gong, like what will currently building. Well, looking into also surfacing things like topics like questions, the objections, we're looking into things like sentiment analysis, like, hey, at that's point like it didn't sound too good. Objections, another one that told the was thinking any anything else comes to mind, like anything email to with Gong so to you.

Client 4: I mean, switch board does something very similar. I think that's part of their product map, That might be something you should look at but I would love to see I'd love a centralized place for all this information to surface whether it lives inside sales versus a plugin or a separate app. I'd love it to be all in one place. And then something that I used, especially when I was prospecting, I believe it was called crystal nose? Where it would actually do, like, a scrape of their social media and everything to see what kind of communication style they had.

Host 2: Those.

Client 4: I believe that's work.

Host 2: And did you see switch?

Client 4: Switch board. I believe that's what it's called.

Host 2: I know once we board, but I don't think that's the one. It's like a remote kind Let me pull up And French head of software development over there.

Host 2: You mentioned you would love the insights to be in one centralized ice please. What what do you mean by that? Which insights.

Client 4: I mean, if I had a dashboard, so instead of pulling up multiple screens to see if everything's lining up. I could just pull up my opportunity within Salesforce or whatever Crm, and it says, you did a great job engaging with this customer here some insights. Here's some potential next steps. Because we get lost. You know, I think that would be great. Yes. The other company is called Switch.

Host 2: What's the website? See.

Client 4: It is switch board dot eight p p.

Host 2: I mean, i'm on... I'm on that website nav but it looks different. It's called like a visual kind of It's like a collaboration workplace, but you can record the calls and demonstrations.

Client 4: I I think that's what coming out.

Host 2: Interesting.

Client 4: I'm calling? I don't use it. I just have a friend a software engineer over there.

Host 2: Oh, interesting. Yeah. They'll they'll competitive from, like the first product that we built.

Client 4: Oh, okay.

Host 2: Yeah.

Client 4: But then I just shared the crystal nose. Not... No isn't nutty.

Client 4: Like, k n o w s, i Do i...

Host 2: Because I mean mini view right now. Data. Chad, Colombo told no, got. Perfectly our better. That is great. Awesome. Alright. Well, these are all my questions today.

Host 2: Brandon Enrique, any any your last questions paul make.

Host 5: I think Gong has some sort of, like time view where you have the different activities that's happened in your opportunity. Is that something that you use well. And how do you compare that with People Ai?

Client 4: I lean more heavily on people dot Ai for the timeline just because it seems to show a more visual spike in my activity. That's easier for me to share to my leadership. I haven't used that timeline line activity on the Gong product.

Host 2: You mean the diesel spikes.

Client 4: Just a great dashboard. It shows my activity well. So like, I can prove, I had a call on Thursday, and then I sent all the information to twenty new people trying to get them on a new call for next week. Are you talking Enrique about the deals tab?

Host 5: Hey think so. I think that's what it's called. Yeah. Okay. Nope.

Client 4: That's an interesting view I have not used.

Host 2: Yeah. Gong got a lot of features in my understanding is that everybody uses everything. It's a lot. Well, I guess one last person sorry, we'll and we'll a beautiful of time. What would you take for something to replace gong for you?

Client 4: To replace it? Yeah. I mean, ultimately, it would come down to cost adoption and results. I mean, if we're going to invest in something we need to see results, but we also need people to use it. And I think that's the challenge with any Sas type product. So Yes. Great. Because I still have friends that are my peers that are mid to late six days that are old school. They write down their notes on a notepad and you know, they're just really good with customers, but how they find these customers, I think it's because they've been in the industry for forty years. Yeah.

Host 2: Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you so much Mike appreciate time today, Enjoy the Utah Winter.

Client 4: You have the freezing cold.

Client 4: We'll enjoy the coupon down in Miami.
