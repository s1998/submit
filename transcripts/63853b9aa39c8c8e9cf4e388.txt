Client 3: Yeah. No. It's No. Thanks for joining guys. Actually, we were... We're were having a our our Executive team meeting is normally on Monday afternoon. But my boss has the flu So he was out a commission today. So our meeting tomorrow. But in the conversations i've had, And formally, I I feel very good about kinda of where we are. And I I actually feel very good about getting being able to get something done and signed off her end of month. Oh, probably have a little bit more of an update for you after our meeting. Tomorrow after said an email. Let me just get a call, but I can I can send you an email and I think. You know, definitely you know, the value prop, I think not only from the And a standpoint for from... Well, related to on our Sas standpoint, like, being able to had a meeting with our chief revenue officer this morning and some of the cross functional team that's working on kinda of getting our Bi infrastructure up. And, you know, I mentioned to them I'm like, look, you know, this is part of the stack I'm looking at here is miss Sake, at least for our revenue and growth Saas metrics or, you know, our bookings and kind of those those metrics that are derived from bookings and customers and and revenue you know, we can pretty much get those out of the box you know, with direct connections through a zag. And everybody was kinda like, you know, they were kinda like, oh okay. Wow. We can knock out a bunch of this stuff we're trying to do there. So feel. I I I feel really good about it. I think know, the proposal on adding the two extra months if we pay up the upfront is very interesting So I'll talk with the team more about that tomorrow. You know, just from is standpoint you probably see this with know, series a companies that you're dealing with like us. But obviously, cash important. So anything we can do to know, to spread out cash impact as much as we can as always, you know, we're always trying to do that. So that definitely helps. And I'll give you... I'll give you guys once we have a chance to discuss it, like i'm in our meeting tomorrow. I'm gonna present some of the slides, some of the slides and stuff like that. And Thanks for sending the demo link list because I may actually during our meeting, I made play there's a couple points in the in the demo that I talked for the whole demo was strong. But I thought there's some points are trying to actually play the team and trying say, hey, look, you know, we're actually looking at. So so I feel really good about you know, being able to get to a yes in a signature you know, by november thirty.

Host 1: Awesome. Dan, I don't know if I sent this to you, but if not send it over just because it sounds like you are presenting to non finance teams like Rev robots and whatnot.

Host 1: Yes. We have this sales rep ops example use case. It's like, about ten minutes, but you Put it in half.

Host 1: It's about five ish. And definitely not all encompassing on what you can do with Rev off, but it does have a lot of good up in here as far as, like, visualizations and doing things beyond Salesforce. So I'll send you this along with our full list of metrics that come out of the box. That way you guys can can kinda know what you can expect And with that, a lot of the metrics, you can slice and dice them by, like, different ways, like whether it's by field grab, owner or things like that. So it it they even go beyond, like, what the definition says.

Client 3: So... That's that's really helpful because getting rev ops up and running here our company is just one of my major priorities. And kind of a cross functional one. So I think that'll be really interesting some of that like. That's that's awesome. And i'll. I shared, like with the team I met with this morning, I I shared you know, the original demo length, which is... I mean, it's an hour twenty minute.

Client 3: But there's a lot covered in there. But I think a particular something like this will be really helpful for them to see. I think again the ability to have connectors like, you know, your hubspot in your swipe you know, those those pieces Saas op, you know, potentially is, you know, one that we're interested in. But the ability have those connectors and stuff, I think is is really from a time to value standpoint is, I think is compelling because Otherwise, you know, one of things that team... That team has been talking about as well, wanna go able to be high stack and, you know, we're gonna go warehouse out. Etl tool and all this stuff. I'm like, well, you know, if we don't if We don't need to. Be buying, you know, Etl five tran and then, you know, like a snowflake lake warehouse and building that which take months. You know, we can get a lot of these metrics. Out of the box, you know, Obviously, there'll be some set in bulk, you know, I'm connecting the billing system and getting that. Even through Stripe, but that would be That's super helpful Just the ability to get to value faster. You know, and not having to right, you know, coding to an Api or anything but being able to do it through a a a native, you know, connector. That's that's really cool. In terms of billing systems, and Leaandra you're not. Had touched on this before. Do you have list I know Stripe, obviously, you connect to, but is there like list of other billing systems that you guys integrate with? And I know you had mentioned word has one that was interesting from you know, metered billing type standpoint But would be good to know like which you know, which which of those you have connectors for. You know, Yeah.

Host 1: Right now, we have these five, and also show you So Saas is Charge b Z stripe and old. Charge, I would say, is not something I would recommend. I actually have been hearing that it's worse than stripe as far as, like, getting the data in a way that you can actually do something with it. So recommendations from our end as far as just, like, our customers satisfaction with them and also like the usability and ease of use for you. Is and Saas. Normally really use z how be honest.

Client 3: Yeah. My Good.

Client 2: Oh, sorry. Daniel yeah. I was gonna say that's definitely what Recommend as well. I think Saas tends to be, you know, definitely best practice for organizations, but because you have that usage or meter component. That's what we're way could be a good option for you guys. But recommend a serious look at both. Would would be pretty shocked if fire goes good run for you guys. Yeah.

Client 3: Or, yeah. We're like, just kinda skimming through the website that looks like, you know, it's kind... It's built for you know, metered it's still more from here billings. And I've heard this say with charge me I've heard that you get some of... In terms of if if you just have straight up subscriptions without metered usage kind of stuff. It's okay, but I think with Charge b it sounds to me like a lot of the same limitations. Or pain that we have or stripe But definitely, thanks for the the the shot there because both of, like Saas in and word. Looking at... And with both of those like, you can still ultimately use skype just merchant process, you know?

Client 2: Mh. No.

Client 3: Exactly. So So that's good to know.

Client 2: I'm mean Daniel, what one quick thing too. Just you called out that there was a couple of other errors in the demo that you wanted to grab. And like you said, that demo is pretty long. We have a lot of videos a lot shorter and maybe just healthier to show your team quickly that are, like, kind of quick explain videos.

Client 2: Is there any other areas outside of rev ops integrations, and it would be helpful for you guys to get, like, just more higher level video on, so you're not searching through the recording.

Client 3: Yeah. The wrap super helpful if you could send me a few links if you have any that are like on. Okay. Just You're straight up budgeting and forecasting. You know, those are definitely those are interesting to everybody. Particularly on the executive team. And I know we covered a lot of that material in the demo which is why just I send everybody the demo, but it there is an hour or twenty minutes.

Client 3: Mh. And So you some of those, you know, if you have any links, anything that you think are helpful, planning of budgeting you particularly particularly planning around of what I call workforce planning, right, which is your and Hr integration And and I realized that part of our part of our account is is not reachable if you will, because it's it's our Columbia team, so that's gonna be more of a Csv type thing, but Still I think that part is is really cool. So this is this is neat to there's a whole bunch of on here.

Client 3: Yeah. That's...

Host 1: I'll send you this. It doesn't look like it covers head count playing, but I can actually snip out that part of the demo for you or have Maximus just like, create a really quick walk through.

Client 3: Snippet fine.

Client 3: Because I think she he showed us quite a bit. On the head... Because we we covered that a lot and we talked about that a lot in the demo.

Client 3: So snip it out probably easier than have him after to do more work. You know, if you can step out a few chose that that would be that would be fine.

Host 1: Cool, Okay. Perfect. Yeah. That's really good to know. And Also, you know, I know we're at the tail end here in that we're about, you know, two days out from that in the month and we were hoping get a deal done, but if you guys do, like, you know, December whenever just be like, hey, we actually wanna to show our team something. Just reach out to me and I'm happy to, like, jump on a call and show them even if it is, like, in that limbo time between getting started and, you know, signed the deal.

Client 3: And I'm I'm I'm really pushing to try to get this done November I wanna... I really wanna check this off the list, and I I I feel based on the conversations I've had. Including him informally with my boss and everything. We we like as an executive team we like to we like got healthy consensus around, you know, around these things. So So I'm pushing hard.

Host 1: Awesome. I guess last thing address here is I know we kind of like touched on it a little bit, but is the pricing you know, is is that considered finalized as far as like, that is good by your guys then. It's more... I guess what are what would be a reason why this wouldn't happen by the end of the month.

Client 3: I think, you know, from a pricing standpoint, particularly with the particularly with like, you know, the the be pay up upfront fifty the extra two months free know, takes the pricing down you know, below you know, two k a month And that's so much pricing, but it I mean, if it were possible, If it were possible to do that with semi annually, semi annual billing?

Client 3: That would be, you know, that would be really nice. If that's possible. You know, I know I know we had originally talked about quarterly And you guys can't do that to same. So even on a semi annual basis. If that's possible, if if you guys, you know, if it's worth asking, you know, I'm asking. So if if that's something that's possible, know, let me know shoot me an email I realized you probably have to talk in internally about that. So you know, should be an email or something. Because I think happening. Yeah It.

Client 2: Yeah. It's something that we we haven't seen before because that's kind of one of the the stipulation for that.

Client 2: Concession, but no. The Harm is asking you yeah. I mean, I I see why I drove for you guys. Sounds like we're a little bit close and that could help. So probably, you know, less than likely, but, yeah. I no harm is asking again, so we can definitely let's catch off this and we can find that up change.

Client 3: Yeah. If you guys don't mind asking, you know, it would be good. I'm just being you know, the cash manager that I that I need to be. So So I have to ask.

Client 2: Call it.

Client 2: Yep. Absolutely.

Host 1: Cool. Well, Dan, we have this scoping call tomorrow, It really is just of like for us to get ahead of, you know, anything that we could see was right, but it should be a breeze. I mean, I'll bring up our data Team on. Her name's is Gertude. She leads part of the data team over there and so she'll just be asking some questions on Perfect.

Client 3: Okay Great. I'm I'm still i'm So perfectly fine more.

Host 1: Awesome. And then what time is your meeting tomorrow with your boss.

Client 3: Maybe our team teammates tomorrow at three eastern It's normally on Mondays at three eastern, but No. Three three central.

Client 3: Thanks. Cool. But that's tomorrow.

Client 3: So So I'll I'll let you guess much right after that. I'll I'll give you guys a heads up for sure.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 3: I'm around Wednesday on Wednesday actually looks pretty open for me right now.

Host 1: Nice. Okay. Does it make sense? For me once I find out Denisha and I will we'll try an answer on that on my anal today. Again, really no promise on that. It's it kind of is, like a stipulation for the three months. But if whether we get a yes or no on that, since it sounds like we're pretty much at like, we're up against the wall with, like, the pricing and levers and things like that. I'm gonna put the or affirmed through Doc, And if it all it after tomorrow, we can get it all good to go and if not definitely hop on a call in address anything.

Client 3: Sure. Absolutely.

Host 1: Oh, Awesome. Well, we're gonna be on a call tomorrow morning again. So we'll talk soon.

Client 3: In morning.

Host 1: Thank you guys. Anything else that you want to go over?

Client 3: No. I think Thanks for the the And from look... Like, the videos I think is will be a really cool thing to share, particularly i rev up of if you have. Wanna just, you know, like, just links like you did last time?

Client 3: Down. That's fine. And if if you wanna snip you know, for just, you know, we don't need, like, you know, hollywood video editing here. Just snips on our workforce planning of, I think is is is good to see Perfect.

Host 1: Okay. Cool. I'll do that. I should be able to get it done before my next meeting. So I'll do that right now.

Client 3: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.

Host 1: Well, you too. Soon.

Client 3: Daniel.

Host 1:
