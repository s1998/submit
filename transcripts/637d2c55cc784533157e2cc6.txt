Host 1: Good. It looks like your home today Unusual, but my college kids are home.

Client 2: Troy Thanksgiving. So I stayed home stage.

Host 1: Nice. Yeah. I'm in Arizona with my sisters and their fiance and been so it's definitely a four thousand.

Client 2: Yeah Yeah.

Host 1: Never realize how much time travels in this house It's all in here.

Client 2: Really? Yeah. I know Just to get my background and like, it's kind of a little messy thing I have back there but oh well you couldn't.

Host 1: Awesome. Well, I brought Denisha on he's my manager slash our director sales just as extra support here. So I mean, it's been a while. I feel like we haven't talked a long time and was totally my bad for sending the wrong day. I was, like myself so hard for that.

Client 2: For the last Oh my gosh. Yeah. That's okay. I know. I know. And then we have that all team meeting. We literally had everyone in the office last week tuesday zero say Thursday. So was a little bit. A little bit nuts for me, but Yeah.

Host 1: Nice. Yeah.

Client 2: Cool. So a couple updates. Like, so I love the product. Right? Love the product. My you know, I I guess we really went and looked over all of the different know, videos and stuff you had sent and just to recon confirm everything of my head. And I talked to nets suite, and I about getting that connector, you know? I forget what it's called, but I... Like Ice screenshot kinda what you said everything. And they first gave me a price of six thousand dollars and then I got them down to five. I don't think I can get them any farther. So that's five thousand dollars annually that they'll give us. Which I might be to bring down at our renewal. You know, but whatever is for seven months. So Usually get about a twenty four percent discount. So I might be able to bring that out a little bit more than. But I he said no not now. I'm just like, okay. You're hoping i'll cards five. But so there's that. And then so my only, like, I don't really have... You know, you guys know us right now, we're series a. You know. We just... you know, it's like I'm the only finance person. I mean, I have, like, a definitive this invoice a little bit stuff for me, but So barely objections are, like my own time, and know, the cost, which the cost I think is very reasonable. It's more like just trying to spread out the payment a little bit, you know, like spread out a little bit. So those are right only objections. I think we can get true.

Host 1: Okay. Well, one thing also, I'm know this is non traditional and maybe Denisha close your ears.

Host 1: But I have gotten on the public reps in the past.

Host 1: And like, pretended, like, I was, like, your assistant or something and, like, help someone get a little bit more off. I mean, they honestly don't budge that much, like it's probably not gonna be, like three or like that, but like five k's is typically, like, what we hear as the first go. And like, I'm happy to try right for you for that if you wanted to. But that's as far as everything else that's good to hear. So Yeah. The yeah, let me know if you want me take... You wanna take up on that.

Host 1: But as far as, like, the time aspect.

Host 1: The good thing is you guys have, like, a honestly pretty easy tech back from our perspective as far as like, implementing, So yeah. It should be, like, a little bit of an easier lift, which is why it was a little bit easier for us to waive that implementation fee.

Host 1: Right. But what I'm understanding, does it make sense? Like, if we could do quarterly payments, would that, like, Yeah.

Client 2: Do it for you. That would awesome. Only because, like, we're supposed to go out and fund raise starting in, like, January, like, January early February, you know, to hopefully get some you know, our series b funding we're we're thinking in, like May or June. So they just pushed out to, like, yeah. Quarterly payments would be awesome. Just because that would just like help with our cash. But you guys know how it is. I mean, Software and expenses are not our main part of our cash so it's all people. Right? That's mainly what it is, but anything we can do especially be the finance person to try to be like more, like, try to, you know, push on that a little bit would be awesome. But... Yeah, that would be fantastic. If we can do that. Yeah.

Client 3: Denisha. Yeah. I can...

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: And didn't do that.

Client 3: Yeah kinda kinda of reverse here, but... Yeah, we're we're good to go on that. I mean, i understand that sensitive for you guys on top of the next week quote probably being a little bit higher than we hope to see I can speak confident. That's that's good to go.

Client 2: Okay. That's awesome. Yeah. Next will do quarterly for me. We always do that with them so that would be that will help us too.

Host 1: So...
