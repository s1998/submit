Client 2: Hi.

Client 2: Billy years.

Host 1: Yeah. Hey. Happy New year.

Client 2: How are you doing?

Host 1: I doing well. It's already Tuesday. I guess, it's it was weird having Monday off, but it I'm doing well. How's your break?

Client 2: My break was great. I feel really recharged. Yeah. Just like really rested and and ready for the New year. Totally like it's pound and then and Yeah. Ready to dive in. Did you manage... Did you manage to unplug like over the two long weekends. I know you were working last week hopefully it wasn't too busy.

Host 1: I mean, you know, calls were like, very few far between so I I was on a couple calls i'm glad deal came in, but I took a lot a lot of time off because it just wasn't a lot going on. So.

Client 2: Good.

Client 2: Yeah. Good good.

Client 2: Yeah. I Sorry. What we're gonna say?

Host 1: I i gonna say is it's the first year. I got a couple interestingly It's not super embarrassing, but I got a couple lego sets.

Client 2: Oh fine.

Host 1: And... Yeah. It just it kept me busier for for a while. So that was kinda cool. I've I've never done All M ml live. So someone thought I'd be interested. It was cool. That was cool.

Client 2: Nice.

Client 2: What was the... What was the set... What was that take the project.

Host 1: Yes. So I got I get two of them and they're they're pretty... Like, for engineers like it's like a pretty they're not that challenging. It just takes time. But one was Singapore the Marina seals bay.

Host 1: And then the other was actually the London Bridge.

Client 2: I've haven't done. Oh cool.

Client 2: Is is it really a leverage?

Host 1: It's it's for, like, people... Like, what it is actually, it's cool you to build something really cool out of legos, but it's like a it's like a manual. And you follow the in the instructions, but it starts to, like, very simple like, oh, this is easy. And then it gets like, really difficult. Like, you know only have to build stuff, but you have to organize everything like a super interesting way. So yeah it's... I can imagine you start building like a giant lego set, it would take months of your time.

Client 2: Wow. Okay. That's amazing. I didn't realize they get so elaborate.

Host 1: I didn't either. I didn't even.

Client 2: Oh, fun. I can see how you would like really enjoy that. Yeah. Okay. Well, let me know when how London bridge is going.

Host 1: I wanna see that.

Host 1: I'll let you know.

Client 2: How big are they?

Host 1: Not very big. They're like maybe, like, three or four books stacked on top of each other.

Host 1: Yeah. They're bigger than that.

Client 2: You know, like Cool. Let me double check it Galadriel is joining But while done on getting a couple of deals signed, last week, and yesterday, of cool, How did yep They diversity vc.

Client 2: Did you like speak to them? Was there more conversation back and forth after our call.

Host 1: Mean Right Amin was on a call and she's out until this the ninth. So I don't think she noticed yet, but lot before she went on break, I sent her and I sent lot a agreement and Then just followed up with Amin, but I included lot in, and then I seen he looked at it yesterday and like, alright. Let's see what haven't signed it. So I think New year new budget There was a yes they were just waiting Yeah.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: Amazing. It's it's pilot it. So I mean, it's it's pretty know Yeah.

Host 1: We'll see. Yeah. That that's the downside.

Host 1: Yeah. But the other one, Trans ventures was no pilot you know, That's a good client.

Client 2: Yeah. Where does it come about? I mean, it's not even a name that I think. I've I heard when discussing the pipeline opportunities.

Host 1: Yeah. Tri us. I wonder where they came from they came through a demo submission Okay.

Host 1: And I think not pulling up my notes stress. So I don't actually know but they might have come through, like, some kind of referral program or some kind of referral from somebody. Really cool though I feel like I had just sell him pretty hard on it. I'm trying to see where he came from. Yeah. I don't know where he came from, but he must have known about us from someone, and then they use donut, but he switched over to Ms teams and he's like, I can no longer use donut.

Host 1: Right. We're we're a good solution.

Client 2: Right. Hi, Galadriel.

Client 3: Sorry I have a few minutes late. I was opening in orange. It wasn't even a good reason.

Client 2: It's okay. We're easing in Yeah.

Client 3: It's officially citrus season if you didn't know that. January kicks Our current oranges is and great for season which.

Client 3: I literally went to the Grocery store on new Year's day to get citrus. So Yeah.

Client 2: I've you like, kilos of the sweetest mandarin and... Yeah. Jackie Mountain monster. So was... Yeah. I've got on the trends. No. Nope. No orange is a great yet, but I'll take a note. I'll take a note.

Client 3: They're great. This time of year specifically.

Host 1: Didn't know that like in the south like in Georgia, Florida, obviously.

Client 3: Yeah. In West Coast, so California is a big signal. Okay. Yeah. I remember that for my whole foods today i'm like, January line, we would bring all this citrus to the front of the Produce aisle and heavily promote. And it be a sumo oranges. I don't know if you're heard of those, but They're particularly sweet. I think they're like seven dollars pound, they're really extensive of. But customers would just be Jan one, like, ready for Sumo Sumo and come in just for that. And I got on board, and I'm still on board.

Host 1: Wow, That's cool. I have I have at least four oranges a day, actually.

Client 2: Really wow.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: Would they like to like the main fruit that I I can take eating. You know, like, I like fruit, but it's the one that's super easy.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: It's like the little one's like, not the clementine, but they're just, like small oranges. I'll get, like, three packs, a we can just go through them on.

Client 3: Do you put... You her put some sentiment in on them?

Host 1: No. Never never heard of that. But maybe I'll try Yeah.

Client 3: It actually makes them sweeter. Counter.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Well, speaking of tips and tricks, a Chef told me that if you're making a really good tomato salad, them and then put a touch of sugar and that really brings out the tomato flavor.

Client 2: Yeah. Speaking of combos. Yeah. Anyhow and We're just chatting about a thing well down on a deal that got signed yesterday and then another one during during last week. So that's that was really exciting news Great.

Client 3: So stage two with today. Right?

Client 2: Or as a third one.

Client 3: As a third line, Yeah.

Client 3: It was she was today.

Client 2: Oh, sorry. Yesterday, Diversity Vc.

Client 3: Okay.

Host 1: Stage two was in December. Right? Last week.

Client 2: Yeah. Thirty first.

Client 3: Okay. I'll make sure they're on the reporting.

Host 1: Yeah. Bill you had three come in in December. Right?

Client 2: Well, yeah. Octopus octopus, stage two, and startup up experts. Yeah. But two of them are essentially. Is stage two and haven't an opt out.

Host 1: Stage two So stage two as a pilot.

Client 2: It's a paid pilot.

Host 1: Okay. Got it.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Nice. That was that helps December and for sure.

Client 2: Yeah. But the really exciting thing about stage two is the audience. It's their Lps, so it's the investors in the fund, and they're all c level execs of the best Saas companies, sea levels of like the Ceo Hubspot is an Lp, Coo of Zoom, Ceo side crazy names. I'm pretty sure this not one from atlas class I'm there.

Host 1: So it's good people to have in our community.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Credible.

Client 2: They're excited for their kids off.

Client 3: We... Stage two over to close one. Is that okay?

Client 2: Sorry you moved it one?

Client 3: When move stage two over to close one.

Client 2: Oh, I moved get to pilot, but Yeah.

Client 3: If we move it into... If we move into close one, then it'll show up on our Arr report.

Client 2: Okay. Alright.

Host 1: Yeah. And we i moved back because so I was messing with my pipeline. Put evolved in sort of coming pilot. Do you prefer them enclosed one? Instead of pilot.

Client 3: Yeah. I was actually typing a response to that. So, yes. So as soon as We start receiving revenue from a contract So for example, Eve wet, Wealth, we've already invoice them for the quarter if they don't stay on for the full. Quarter will pro them, but we're still collecting Mr r from them from December and January the months that they have access to the platform. So they should be in close one if we're collecting revenue from them from day one.

Client 3: I see. In when and and that goes to also because when we do our reporting to investors. You say, hey, we brought in, you know, class. Here's the revenue associated with it. So at that point, if we're not if they're not going to continue, then we need to count them as turns. And that is a different route... That is a different reporting process. That I was gonna type of response to and how to do that there. But basically, yes. If it's if we're collecting revenue on it, if there's an onboarding fee, and the subscription starts on the day that the contract assigned, then it's close one and contract is active. Okay. Things like radical B and Octopus, where we aren't receiving revenue from them yet. Like, they have a free pilot they have ample space and room to get out of the contract. They... That's why they stay in pilot.

Host 1: I think Evolves we waive their onboarding fee.

Client 3: We did, but their contracts started So they don't have an non onboarding video right.

Client 3: But their contract and there for their subscription started on the day that they signed in the contract.

Client 3: Okay. From day one we're we're billing them for the Mr r or whatever. The mr r for their their access to the platform. Makes sense it does.

Host 1: I'm sure more questions on it as...

Client 3: I mean, terms of what's ideal Yeah.

Client 3: But like, radical Vc, there is no no onboarding and they had said that in their contract, they wouldn't be billed until after their ninety day opt out period. And so therefore, we weren't collecting any revenue from them. So I kept them in pilot. Octopus similarly, like, no i'm. And they don't pay us anything until after their pilot. So kept them in pilot. But as soon as we start invoicing them, then I then goes over a close one.

Host 1: Okay. So, like, diversity dc they They have a thirty day opt up, but they're paying the onboarding fee. They do not go on pilot.

Client 3: They go into close one. So what happens is if they... So... And also their subscription starts on the day that the contract is signed. So we start filling them from there. For their annual subscription. So if they're most transcription started on Jan one, for the first month of the subscription they're they're were getting double, They're getting paid double essentially, which is why the onboarding fee works is they're getting paid for the onboarding and they're getting paid for the Mr associated with the subscription. If they do choose to not move forward after the thirty day opt, we will reimburse them for the eleven months of the subscription that we didn't that they didn't use. But we still what we still collected on the month of January revenue, which is why we can still claim it as revenue.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Their contract starts on one thirty.

Client 3: Okay. So that it yeah.

Host 1: Who just Whatever. Well just... It's the same thing. We just started on one thirty.

Client 3: Yeah. Okay. Yeah we changed the contracts our. Okay.

Host 1: Well, do we want to go over in this meeting wanna go over some things in pipeline or do we just wanna catch up on what happened in q four? Get what what make sense from here.

Client 2: So Galadriel, you're working on the investor update, but it feels like everything has been reported. Do you feel like you have a full grasp on new accounts in total Mr r?

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Arr roi I do.

Client 3: I mean, in the last update, i think so lead how we did the updates quarterly, they go out to everybody and current investors and prospective investors, they go out, that goes out to, like, whole network of investors. Monthly only go out to our existing investors. So on the quarterly one, last quarter, we is there any follow ups on, like, success from the Ed tech? Hours outreach that we did because we put that in the last one, it would be nice to close the loop on that. Say to like draw any examples of success.

Host 1: So we would we built the pipeline we did get a verbal yes but they pushed to January. So I think q one might be a better indicator of in a result we can get from el learning beyond the fifty k pipeline. Okay. My my conclusion is you you can compare the interest to, like, community managers it compares like Vcs based on the outreach amount that we're doing, it was about the same without us knowing where our buyer persona was, so I think it's worth continuing el learning.

Client 2: Actually that that's a good segue because I know you you've showed me your stats. Was really exciting to see. So wondering if you wanna go over that quickly, a little bit of remedy as well.

Host 1: I can. A lot of the information in there is for me. Know, because, like, I'm just organizing my thoughts for q in twenty twenty three. So there's it's like thirty slides I can go really a high level, but I I don't know how how much information do you do you want on this?

Client 2: I'm I'm happy to take a look. Go over now. If it's... Yeah. A a little bit of lessons of out of from the past and and looking forward to scout ideas because tomorrow, And and I are looking in the numbers. It's scenario planning and finalizing some ideas Friday. So... Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. I will go through it and if you want me just to go faster, I can because I make So what I did like a q four summary, and then I did like, a q one and then, like, some things to hit twenty twenty three revised Do you want to skip q four? Are you wanna go into q four?

Client 2: High level. It cover it don't.

Client 3: Yeah. That would be helpful to hear some of those ideas into the investor letter.

Host 1: Okay. Can i share quick screen. Yeah.

Client 2: Yay.

Host 1: Can you see my my notes at all or just a slide just applied.

Host 1: Alright. I've never done this in in slides. I'll I'll keep it is high level as as I can. I I put the last one here, because I know we.

Client 2: I love it.

Host 1: Okay. So this is only new business. Right? And I'm skipping anything, like, pipeline for q one, like calls this week and stuff like that. So again, no renewal are involved in here And so I I just put this in here because it just... I think goes over maybe what the state of community is in twenty twenty three. So this is Jamie. I had to chat with Jamie, and she's a senior director of community at unusual ventures. These are not necessarily like in our target don't now. But she got laid off in November, and then she started to say this is exactly what community managers need to consider if they wanna be taken seriously in twenty twenty three. So user driven development, research and reporting, and then connecting. So we kind of already know this stuff, but I just put it in here we can go deeper on this if you want to, but i'm gonna keep a high level. I think it's Relevant.

Client 3: Know why she was let though.

Host 1: No. I didn't I think i didn't ask the difficult questions.

Client 2: Is that's. Right?

Host 1: Sorry?

Client 2: Is that her public post on Linkedin or from your conversation?

Host 1: This is her public post on Linkedin. So she got... She's already starting... She's doing her own consulting now. So choose the second community lead at unusual adventures. I think they're head of community was not let go. So I think it's still there for them but they obviously cut budget.

Host 1: Unusual. So I gotta change my...

Client 2: That's a powerful closing though. These questions haven't ester your mind, I have to ask why did you build a community to begin with?

Host 1: I think it was like some message to unusual. Do you know what I mean? With this post? A little bit.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: Any... Yeah. Should I move on from this? Yeah. I also just put this in here. So I did a lot of content from outreach Salesforce this is back in twenty twenty one, but This is the state of of B to b. It's a really trending pattern. So Their data says more meetings with more people are needed to close a deal. Sales cycles have increased. So I just wanted to have a quick look here and considering this for a sales process. Right? Always good to keep in in touch what's happening with b. Any thoughts for questions on this? K. Q four sales metrics and yeah. And we I know you have this. But from my counts we did about ninety k in signed agreements in total contract that includes pilots in sixty two k was recurring revenue. So we did about thirty k or thirty percent in pilots. And so I'm using this as base to set metrics in q one. So Yeah. I I have a lot of other notes on this bug and I'm gonna keep a high level.

Client 2: initial that the Ac has dropped to six k the Ac for q four was six k, but the Ac for twenty twenty two total was about eight point five.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: But, yeah did it did drop in form.

Client 2: Yeah. We've been trying to get it Yeah. I'm from ten k for a while now. Yeah. So I so it's that's that's that's low from cheaper. Now we were doing a lot five k deals.

Host 1: December December was slow. December some momentum in our pacing numbers and definitely heard our Ac. I mean, even if we had three more five k deals, our Ac would not have increased. So I think our Ac was impacted, but December was This is q four split up by outbound inbound, and I So I I like numbers. If you don't like numbers, I am sorry to to look at this. It's not all numbers. But inbound is really solid. I think we should maximize the inbound because it expectations and calls booked and send agreements Outbound did build a pipeline with that fifty k in in el learning, but it didn't lows. The only thing that did close, billy where your four deals So you're three December plus Octopus, which I thought was November, but those are the four deals I put.

Client 2: Oh, maybe wrong remember Maybe it was November, honestly, I can't remember from the top of my head. Sounds like late Q four. But... Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it might be right because we were trying to kick off the pilot in December. You're right.

Host 1: Yep. Yeah. Either way, it was a q four. And so these outbound numbers are actually skewed positive because of those deals Hopefully, it gets better. With outbound in terms of closed deals in q one. I just put this up you.

Client 3: You know how inbound leads we got last quarter?

Host 1: Inbound leads, like inbound books meetings?

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: We had seventy nine inbound calls. In q four, so are you somewhat about q four last year?

Client 3: Q four. That sounds like a lot. So that is they submit They say they wanna sign up for the newsletter or they submit a demo request form on the website and they you reached out to them and they book a meeting.

Host 1: Yeah. So this seventy nine is total calls. So if I had three calls or four calls with one company. Included in the seventy nine. So I don't know the unique number of inbound, but I can I can find that out.

Client 3: Something. Are they are you seeing any from the inbound, the ones that are coming in for, like, the newsletter or the the award that we have the wipe the more than what was the white paper, Do you see that those converting to calls or is it just the ones that are submitting a demo request form.

Host 1: That's that's something I should look into. So I know, like, off hand, it's probably fifty fifteen. Fifty percent are coming from white paper versus book a demo, and then maybe half of those to two thirds are actually booking a call.

Client 3: So that's that'd be me to get.

Client 3: Yeah. That's okay. I wanna spend too much time on it. I think they logically the ones that come to the website to book a demo or more likely to convert into a call. Just wanted to look at the award we got, and then we out them. I was just curious.

Client 3: But... Because sometimes I see them, like, those leads coming in is, like, Gmail account our personal accounts. So looks like I curious how much those are actually converting.

Host 1: Don't pay much attention to the ones that use at Gmail to sign up. I'll I'll send them send them an invite to connect and one of them did book actually, this week through a Gmail new and it is, but I'm not even adding them Salesforce until I know what they're about, but it's it's if you have a business email, you qualify yourself.

Client 3: They automatically get synced with Salesforce.

Host 1: Yeah. So when i when they book a meeting and I convert into contact, they actually automatically go qualified opportunity, they should go into prospecting instead. But I I can when I when I put them in there, and if don't go forward. I'll just kick them out of the opportunity. K. Okay. Yeah. Quick snapshot of our beating. These are all the signed agreements in q four and December. Okay. So this is where the el learning is. This is our outbound emails did by industry and... Yeah. So you can see the el learning has similar interest of Dc and Cms C. I'm just combining specialized networking software subscription and other hand I think we had enough interest to continue to push on it. Obviously, we had a lot more outbound, but that's because we don't know who the key buyer is. So as we figure out who the key buyer is, that's gonna even out in terms of output outputs input. This is revenue. So this is our science or closed one and our pilots per industry. So the only thing to note here is that Billy with your three Dc deals in December We we went down a little bit from our total in twenty twenty two. But before you sign those three Vc deals, I think we cut our Vc closed one in half. Which I think it's a good thing. So we're focusing on networking and software other.

Client 2: And by specialized mean, private communities, or just networking groups.

Host 1: Paid unpaid.

Client 2: Pay paid.

Host 1: Okay. So, like Tri ventures that signed last week and then diversity vc, they're both to specialized networking, they're both paid on unpaid.

Host 1: Open pipeline. So this is maybe a metric investors are interested in. This is everything we have open. So it there's about six hundred k, and that's for total twenty twenty two. Half of that about three hundred k was created in q four. Going forward I still wanna convert our Dc pipeline.

Host 1: Addition to every active opportunity out there. So I think we have a lot of strong q one ops in the pipeline. Really wanna close these logos. So B, I'm having a conversation with You to cha June.

Client 2: Wait, bricks, I'm chatting with the community person over at B.

Host 1: She wants to connect in January. She's an opportunity. I need to get her on a call. I'm prospecting she's not qualified yet.

Client 2: Well did that come about?

Host 1: Outbound.

Client 2: Amazing. Well done. And we are a client of B. So hopefully that should count something.

Host 1: Yeah. They're they're aware of us anyway.

Client 2: Nice.

Host 1: There's a lot more logos. These are just a few in my pipeline. Like I'd include Cor or Hubspot those would be great also.

Client 2: Yeah. Have a follow up with next week.

Host 1: Okay. And these are tee up in terms of conversations for January. So hopefully, q one at the latest January, if everything goes right.

Client 2: Awesome.

Host 1: Another big three in metrics. And again, if you want to go faster, let me know. I'm I'm just going through this one thing at a time. So with these big three, think these are the biggest things that I'll need to measure on the sales side for twenty twenty three. And these are twenty twenty two numbers. So we have a sixty five day average sales cycle for all of twenty twenty two. That actually got bigger in q four because we had a slow December. So we wanna reduce that to thirty days while also increase in the deal size. Or Ac. Yeah. I got slower. It's eight point three total in in twenty twenty two. Yeah. I think it's just over six in q four, but we want that at ten k. So I'll show in some some of the next slides how maybe if we increase our target to a hundred k monthly, that'll guide some activities are closing tactics and see if we can nudge those upwards, but q four Yeah. You know, thirty k was our monthly and that's up actually on a monthly basis from our twenty seven point eight of total twenty twenty two. So we're trending in the right direction or pacing upwards. Any thoughts questions on the slide? I'll send this deck over to you you can have a look at some things. Okay. Last thing in q four just to recap shorten sales cycle, more second calls with Dms a lot quicker, so I'm gonna be asked for a lot of second meetings with a lot more people in my first calls. I wanna revamp pricing. I have I some slides on pricing, I can show you, but we wanna increase our deals our deal size. Increase inbound get more targeted with outbound. Yeah. Those are the basic things that I want.

Client 2: I really liked your idea that stores being increasing Tv goal to basically not even talk about the essential plan.

Client 2: I really really like about it. And it's... After you mentioned and I'm like, Wow. Why didn't we... Why why didn't we experiment with it sooner?

Host 1: It's it's a risk. I think when you start doing that, you get more into product market fit conversation So from product market fit with companies and nets matching their budget at twelve k, then we're gonna land deals. But if we're too far ahead. They might get turned off before we have the chance to offer a six k. But I think we're the point where it's good offering.

Client 2: Mh.

Host 1: Okay. Just So Just to process some goals like, ahead, they're not forecast. They're they're simply targets and there's a lot of assumptions and it's really hard to celebrate at now. If they're gonna be attainable, but they're meaningfully set based on q four in twenty twenty two. So if we hit the targets I think we're at product market fit. And I don't think we're yet a product market fit.

Host 1: So q one, I'd really like to increase our targets see if we can get more calls or if more calls are actually being significant towards reaching that. So in addition to more emails and being more targeted, I want to to close fifty percent of our sales target. So in Four, we close fifty percent So if we hit that fifty percent of the new target we're gonna be out q four. Does that make sense?

Host 1: And then I'm gonna keep trying to you're saying if we if we close a hundred and thirty five in q one, we will have a hundred and fifty percent growth over Q4.

Client 3: This They understand that right?

Host 1: Yep. Yep. That's right. Right. So we did we did about sixty two k. In Arr, if I convert... If we can convert a hundred thirty five k in Arr. And we do the same thing where we convert half of our goal, which is still might be difficult to do in q one. We're gonna grow quite a bit in one. And by setting the higher targets, we're gonna see, yeah. If the prospecting increases can help us reach that. The goal is to increase exceed this. And then it's broken up between bones and inbound. The the main takeaway from this is I need to be adding a hundred prospects per day in a if I get a hundred prospects per day, five days a week for q one, and I can certainly hit calls to meeting booked. And then convert enough of those calls into cells, we should get close that fifty percent if not exceeded. This is an assumption.

Client 2: And basically, this is a target where you were just you're just projecting your own activity. So I'm I'm taking out of this in terms of Activity video calls and deals.

Host 1: In in terms of ideal scenario this is lee everything I'm doing, but if you on your are doing fifty k or more a quarter that is gonna help us exceed Yeah.

Host 1: Or actually hit the target. Yeah. Yep.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: We wanna talk about At all right now or skip through that right now? Is to irrelevant?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: So...

Client 2: Let's let's quickly touch on everything.

Host 1: Okay. So I'll just give like my halo hotel in O. I think it's still early. I think we're still a ramp up scenario, but fifty fifties is what we wanna aim for. And I think that's something It's an ambition target ambitious Target worth shooting for. So it's a hundred and seventy k on the your total. So I'm basically doubling my base. Q four here on the left is actual. That's forty two k in Arr that's on a quarterly basis. So I want fifty fifty, my Ot that's two hundred and twelve k. That's a five x increase. If that's possible, it's really unknown. And I don't know if it would be reasonable to expect that. In q one, actually, I know it wouldn't be. And we do what was our Arr in in twenty twenty two? I have three fifty five is that a new business. Is that right for you?

Client 3: Don't know. I would have to pull it to be honest with you.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 3: That sounds that sounds about right.

Client 3: Yeah. Because I think there's like, a hundred and q one hundred and fifty and q two, See... Yeah. So that sounds like that'll be right but I can I and bullet it Later.

Host 1: I'm I'm only basing this on partly in the fact that we hit fifty percent of our target in four and then also based on this target that we're gonna set. Let let's keep it at eight fifty, that'd be a really big increase. That'd be a hundred and fifty k year over year increase in revenue So I'm thinking my quota my ramp up quota should be fifty percent of seventy k monthly in q one and then reevaluate on a quarterly basis. And then hopefully, raise it towards that fifty k and that actually aligns with our targets in the previous slides. So if I if if I was the fifty k, of that quota, we would be doing twenty five percent increase european over end revenue.

Client 2: I want to confidently It's it's it's really big.

Client 2: It's. Yeah. But that it it's somewhat grounded in numbers. Yeah. Like, there's a path to it. A lot of things will have to align, but It doesn't seem complete improbable There there's a lot of unknowns.

Host 1: Right? But it's it's a good starting point. If we find out that you know, the the state community or the economy or whatever reason it's just not working out or the resources we put into it are not able to hit this at least will know the gap.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Any need new thoughts son Ot, anything else? Or we'll just leave it there and and see where it goes.

Client 2: I mean, Yeah. Just for your own sake, really excited to get you up to your ot as soon as possible all it's in. The motivation for a couple of partnerships to land a drive inbound But it did cross my mind. Let me close stage two because these these are some big logos that if if some of them get interested fast and decision makers. Put you on those deals, really support you with Yeah. I wanna be sending every every warm like intro that comes over. I wanna be sending you more of these as I focus lauren in person networking and opportunities in the Uk and really throw even more stuff over the fence. Like Us based deals for you.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. I think I agree, like, maybe as much of the Us new business is possible on my end, Yes.

Host 1: I think that would help. That help gets out you. Okay. Trying to keep it at high level recap This is a recap on twenty twenty three. Okay. So do wanna go... This isn't, like less metrics for investor and just more, like, strategy. Is this of interest to dive into right now?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. So just just some strategy items for twenty twenty three again, all assumptions they gotta be tested. But they're based on the numbers you know, in the previous slide. So no up on the Vcs. The reason say no more outbound. Is they're tough to close because they have tight budgets. I don't... I think it's only to get tighter depending on the industry that they're in in twenty twenty three. So instead, want... Let's let's convert the pipeline that we have if possible, but then let's double down. On Cms and start focusing improving our upsell game. With some key selling points. So one, I think a good positioning as your tools are critical to success and selling orbit as a really key tool and have that language and phone calls in like, hey, if you want good results, you need good tools because as a salesperson, my tools are everything. I can't hit my numbers without good tools. A community manager is the same thing. So it's one thing to test out and then also selling dedicated Cs team qualitative feedback, raving testimonials, and then I'm getting into more calls with Merry to make sure that we can actually grab some internal Kpis and get some quick wins. These are like, the high level changes that I think or the improvements in q one, that should be helpful. And in pricing. Just just some language changes. What is this slide saying here? I curious your thoughts on this I wanna give that range of twelve to eighteen k and to show the six I do wanna move up there maybe in a community size, let's go down to ten k, but I don't like the thirty day opt outs.

Host 1: So I don't like them for two reasons. One, I don't like the language. But also it seems that we're not converting a lot of our opt outs into Arr. So when I like to offer a pilot or an opt out, but I know that's probably necessary. I think that we can at least change the language to paid trials and say, hey, you know, we do pay trials I wanna ask them how the they typically we do pay trials because they can tell me and I can just match them at that or I'll say, our paid trials are a ten percent of our annual contract. So they're gonna start at What is that one point two or one point eight k for thirty days? I'm not gonna mention thirty day. Have been in unless unless we've update our contract to someone we like that language. But my I like to test that out. Another thing I'd like to do is base it on community size. So I'll show that in next slide. But wanna start talking about two year paid agreements. And if you can send it to your reduce your whole contract belly by ten percent that is typically closed in the past. Is it gonna work on the Cms? I don't know. But it's something that we can test out when we update the pricing.

Client 3: I think with the... Like, can we go back to the yeah. We should definitely play around with you onboarding. And, like, figure that out. Agreed, we should try whatever structures, you think could work. We did do we did do the structure that you're suggesting here. Up until, like, mid last year.

Client 3: Mh. And the reason we changed it was because we did have a really high conversion rate. So we had, like, an eighty five percent conversion rate from pilot to contract, and We also really wanted to close q too strong, and we high conviction that all of those are going to do, so we could pre... We could preemptively report their revenue now. Right? It's basically i saying. So we move deals basically a month faster as opposed to showing, like, a month slowdown in sales cycle.

Client 3: So not a reason not to try it again, but I just wanted to share with you that that was why we tried... We're trying opt out. But we could play around with other options if you want. And then the the two year annual contracts with the discount. Is that discount if they pay the two years upfront or is that just if they sign it your? Contract.

Host 1: They would have to pay the two upfront. Two percent I mean, it depends on what we what we need.

Host 1: If we can pick it annually at ten percent. Of course, that works, but you want it up upfront. We can make the requirements.

Client 3: Yeah. I think that that's better for us because they all... Like, I mean, as much as a contract is important thing have in place, we've seen, you know, people on one place say, we're we're done and just stopping us I think the same thing could happen two your contracts Or especially with these higher contract value ones.

Client 2: Yeah. And I think we could go higher on the discount because in this environment, it's gonna be hard to get prospects to pay two years upfront. And they just make it extra attractive.

Host 1: How i did account? Where'd you go?

Client 2: I don't know. Fifteen twenty percent even. If it's a... If it's a good logo, just get them in.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. And I didn't... When you when you explained a pilot in the way that it worked with closed one, you know, I wrote this up before i knew that. I think just quite a bit more thought. Around length... Maybe it's just a language change and that's it.

Client 3: Yeah. And I think there's ones like, if you if like, for example, you really get the feeling that eve wealth. Just picking one other the hat. Just for, like, instead example purposes. But, like, if you we were like, i know they're gonna sign this contract with thirty opt out, but I know that they're treating the thirty day that is like a free trial. Like, let's reconsider what we're signing and, like, definitely do it is like, a paid trial to save that from just closed loss and then also turning, yeah. Like, especially as you get towards the end of, like, the sales process, and you just have feeling that they're not really taking it seriously. They're just taking it as a the thirty day opt out as a, you know, get out of jail free card. Definitely, like reconsider maybe just give them a paid pilot.

Host 1: Yeah. I think think with those ones they ask for a pilot. Like like, give a pilot program like, no, but we a thirty day opt out. So they just replace the language, but for them is still paid pilot. They have no intention of sending an annual. They have intention things work out. So I... Yeah. I think it just requires more thought on my end maybe.

Client 3: Yeah. And you can, like, play with them low and be like, no. We don't do that. But if you think that they're really interested be like, oh, let me see if I get my manager to maybe sign off on a big trial. I throw them along. So that they know it's not something that we just dole out. To anybody. It's it's not our standard our standard process, but, like, if you they could be good and worth the shop. Like, yeah, we'll make special concession for you. Okay. Okay. Makes sense.

Host 1: So pricing points again, Oh sorry, I'm sorry.

Client 2: Just just one. I really like the language of breaking it down to a monthly fee. Oh, it's one k, monthly paid annually. A language for calls. It sounds very yeah.

Client 2: Well, it kind of... It it it provides logic to the twelve k which is what we had originally, and then we kind of started struggling with twelve eighteen k there's gonna be interesting to try to get up there to those amounts.

Host 1: I'm also curious to... I mean, I've I've used that strategy in the palace and it that is tended to work out especially when I can combine it with the two year annual agreements.

Host 1: Yeah. I'm I've not used that yet, but I think it helps them contextualize what it actually is and and maybe sounds a bit cheaper than twelve k annually.

Host 1: So I'm gonna start doing this this week.

Client 2: Yeah. I'm gonna start using some of that language as well.

Host 1: And I'll just I'll update this in the playbook as well just so we have that. Because I don't know if you pull up on calls, but I pull up so is helpful.

Host 1: Okay. Pricing wise, again, this is just a thought. I like the thought, but it just helps me, like, logically go to next steps, and it also helps us, I think upsell. So right now we're selling based on features. And I think if we wanna be able to clearly sell the court value, and consider, like, what it's gonna take to go into a new tier as to be clear what that price has escalation involved beyond just the feature because I don't like just feature selling. So every tier You're also selling the previous tier and it goes up by in addition to future, community size, So less than five hundred, I can offer a a six k annual. And if I already know on a phone call, i'll I'll i'll still give the twelve k range. But if they say that's way too high. I don't know. I gotta figure that out. How do I drop them down to a six k without them thinking I'm trying to hide something for them or maybe I just give it six k for every under five hundred, and then we try get. Is many calls over that number and So five hundred to five k. Gonna offer twelve k. And then anything over five k, I'm gonna offer eighteen k say this is what our typical pricing is and this is what you get with it.

Host 1: So I know it's a bit of a a shift, but I think it's gonna help the community manager like, understand how our pricing works is gonna be easier sell to their Cfo.

Client 3: Yeah. So we we've also done something like this too. Maybe changing how you talk about it is the trick we've run into this problem where they say, oh, the five hundred five hundred people is only five thousand dollars, well I have a community of ten k. I'm only gonna now five hundred inmates a month.

Host 1: Right?

Client 3: Which is why we added. It was, like, community size and features. In doubling it and making actually downplay the volume. As being a cost driver for us, to avoid that that issue. Exactly.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 3: Have any ideas for how other ways we could get around it.

Host 1: We could offer stuff.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: And well, he had the other that... That's definitely being a blocker, but I used to have in visiting on the twelve k, one to one or group matching?

Host 1: The reason I did.

Host 1: Sorry?

Client 2: Mean the top tier.

Host 1: Reason I put it in the top tier, is because I think her group matching isn't like, flushed out yeah. Premium is not We not the biggest selling point. Like, Wealth did the group match and maybe we can offer that instead of one to one, I can have that in conversation, but I don't think but I don't think replacing one to one four group matching on the pro here. Is like, the big selling point. I think my conversations telling me is the top recommended matches. Which is the selling point. That's why I highlighted it here.

Client 3: It's also access to data now that we have like, all of the downloads in the platform for pro tier. And the inside dashboard with like, twelve different metrics for pro tier. That's the that I think is a big selling point that isn't included on pro. And then for premium. It's the level of customization. So, like, that added custom questions, the feedback forms the just ability to customize the their workspace more and and do the white labeled email addresses, for example, So you found that those features that we put into pro and also in premium are the biggest reasons that they're moving into a new tier.

Host 1: Which is obviously why we put it in the first place.

Client 3: It they were, but but also, like, top matches is really new. We don't even have that in the platform yet. So we haven't really been selling that. So maybe, maybe that's like, the new thing that they're were excited about pro. But previously it was, like, access to data and then the level of customization that came with premium.

Host 1: Okay. Well, maybe this is like a really line we can have and then you know, maybe I'm finding that the community size actually is hurting us or actually, is not that helpful for the buyer.

Host 1: You're saying it order isn't. So I mean, you have a very different sales approach to how different people solve this.

Client 2: So I think it's definitely worth experimenting. Because I think you have a very strong way of positioning and arguing and reasoning with clients. So I would definitely encourage you to try and see see how you deal with with with these objections. I I have a feeling who might find a good way. Yeah. Reasoning clients and explaining them.

Host 1: Yeah. I think maybe if there's if there's like, a a problem with this with this idea, I'm gonna figure out pretty quickly on calls.

Host 1: Right? I think that's Yeah.

Client 3: I think you'll find... You could find a way around it. Like, hopefully, That was just that was just really tricky with some of the... Like, you get a a a call was a huge client that you thought was a huge community and they say only wanna do five hundred bytes a month. But yeah.

Client 2: But then you come with the features and customer success, and you're like, well, on that tier, there's no. You get your onboarding? And you're like flying solo and for this Vip audience you definitely need Yeah. But I I I know what you mean.

Client 3: Yeah. Maybe it's a combination of both like, usage and features. Yeah.

Host 1: I think I think also if I only offer to twelve eighteen, we're gonna have a lot different pricing conversation on that call one, and I'm gonna I think I think it's just gonna help out. Know they simply can't do it now from like a basic, a very basic package with no Cs team. You're kind of doing this so low and that's when I can bring up the six k to them. Like, maybe that's another way of to position as well. So Yeah. I think you're right. I think I just have to test it out and see what holds I can find Yeah.

Host 1: Before we put this in stone. Okay. This is just a recap on our our key buyer. We already know it. But I got this data from Salesforce. So this is what the people that are buying And this is I'm gonna be targeting going forward. The we think it add to this? Was a hundred plus employees in a million Arr. I think that's a a good place for me to start. But if we get desperate, we can go lower. Really quick on how useful. This is gonna be free, but Only put this market size for Us uk. So this is all the contacts, we have access to right now in Apollo. So head of community, community manager, senior marketing manager. These are buyers, and these are people have not reached out to yet. So it's a lot And this is basically where I'm gonna start from. And then I put that up to el learning. He his obviously a lot a lot smaller. And i don't actually know these are buyers. I'm assuming they are really small market. From people who are buyers.

Client 2: Interesting that we thought Yeah. E learning will be much bigger than actual just community management.

Host 1: They might have bigger than like different titles maybe they're budget Maybe they're more efficient and their budget don't doesn't go towards people it goes toward tech.

Host 1: For all we know. Yeah. But they have less people in these roles.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Okay. Last thing last thing I'm gonna do is focus on hiring. So the two people that I have calls with this week capital, and then also Darby both of them were hired within last five months and they're they're they've both told me that they find a lot of feeling they went have the conversation. So if I pull up everyone we access you in apollo, that are hiring for a community. And I go look at their company that have a couple community roles gonna prospect to them then hopefully get some conversations. So companies with the most community hires, hospital, higher ed, And in government, I don't know if these top three have different types of community than what we're looking for. Obviously, government does not have the roles we're looking for, although they're in the top here. Just a quick snapshot to put that looks like. There's a bunch of other stuff in here for marketing. So I've updated this. I don't think it's super relevant right now. Yeah. I think I think that's the basics. I think that's enough for now. There's a lot more in there in, like, marketing and inbound, but think we need to go into it.

Client 2: Yeah. Cool. We can continue in the one to one tomorrow.

Client 2: Yes. Thank you so much for using last week so constructively to think about how to make twenty twenty three bigger better and stronger. It's really appreciated and exciting to see some new ideas and new approaches. That you're excited to try and me alongside you as well.

Host 1: Yeah. I hope it was helpful. So like for you.

Client 2: Yeah. Very helpful.

Client 3: Yeah. It's definitely a good year to try. All those new things. So Alright.

Client 2: Well, guess this week is also a little bit of i know I'm trying to get calls for next week and meetings, you do have any external... I don't have any internal calls. I have couple of client things, but no prospect conversations. It's more for me trying to get new meetings in terms of rest of the week. You have anything I've I've three calls.

Host 1: I have two from outbound and one from inbound. There might be more. I've tube yes right now in contracts we'll see if those lands in a couple weeks.

Client 2: Nice. Nice. Yeah. And I have one January the clock ventures that I've been hoping for since the end of November, she messaged me Christmas saying that mid January might be our time. So let's see. Let's see. But yeah. Still catching up on things and getting things in the calendar. But... Especially like, C, That's that's top of my bottom of my list. See what they've decided hopefully relaxed and feeling like they have capacity to manage us That was their last email. We're evaluating if we have capacity.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 3: Billy, we have the call with that last in this afternoon.

Client 2: Oh, yes. We do.

Client 3: Hopefully, that we've gone through, what I believe is, like, everything we can do the contract. And they never works fine that last email, but hopefully, Oh my god.

Client 2: That comes through the first week of January. That's gonna be Yeah so.

Client 3: Okay. I'm I'm definitely optimistic for January though.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: You look there.

Client 3: Thank you.

Client 2: Thanks. We'll keep you posted if there's anything worth sharing you, you guys don't know.

Client 2: Right. Well, again, thanks for... Thanks for all the to you work and excited to continue going through it in in that one's one?

Host 1: Good.

Client 2: Thank
