Host 1: Hi Brook.

Client 2: I how are you Great.

Host 1: How are you? I just sent you an email you couldn't ignore it. It was right before you joined.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I joined.

Host 1: Perfect. Awesome. Well, super excited to speak with you. I know we sent over an email before beforehand and if correct me if I'm wrong, but Brie was reaching out to you, You weren't actively looking for a finance solution. Correct? Or were... Was it just good timing and she was reaching out, and then you looked online as well.

Client 2: Wait a minute what But Which product of are we talking Mosaic.

Host 1: So we are a strategic finance platform form to automate everything relating any of your controller. So everything relating to, like, the Fp and side of you're all.

Client 2: Okay. This is the the the the company name didn't recognize or. Don't believe that we talk Before, I think this is the first time.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: This is the first time, but we are reaching out to you over email.

Host 1: And I think this vehicle schedule like two or three weeks ago. So it was a little bit ago, so I understand if it's not fresh in your mind.

Client 2: Okay. Then I I I I the two is that I'm getting so many invitation from the company And i the examine new feature new for that new solution. So just wondering want to hear about the solution to understand what the prices will be. And for example for the next day pipeline. If possible, we will add this course we will consider it in our pipeline and This is the main the domingo that I I schedule this meeting.

Host 1: Gotcha. Okay. That makes sense. So I am curious though you as far as I know, I saw that you guys have a fractional Cfo but you're the only person in, like, the finance team in house. Correct?

Client 2: Yes. No. I have also woo first and I have the office managers of the Hr managers the accounting stuff. Also, we are a team the Us web south outsourcing. But they work part of time with the company.

Client 2: Mh. So this is the structure. We have two companies I'm consolidate both companies and managers all the finance stuff both companies?

Client 2: And the thing is what I mentioned, the multi person the office managers.

Host 1: Gotcha. But you're the one who's handling all of like, the metrics, the go to market metrics and the forecast.

Client 2: Yes. May Also there this more is the Cfo, but is is not is more dealing with the business.

Host 1: Gotcha. Okay. Cool. And then I always like to just clarify because in Israel, priority is a really big accounting system. You guys are using Quickbooks in both of your, like, the Us entity and in Israel. Correct?

Client 2: No. Just Us.

Client 2: Okay. You can allow Israel.

Host 1: Oh, so you're using priority in in Israel?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Darn. Okay. So that's why I sent the email beforehand because we actually don't integrate with priority and just like looking online. I saw that you guys have the majority of your employees in Israel, so it's not like that part is a small portion. We actually don't integrate loop priorities. So Mosaic really is integration platform. And so if we can't in that data, then we're not able to provide a lot of the value that we is really like, our fundamental value proposition. So actually probably doesn't make like get a little bit deeper into it. We actually have a lot of Israeli companies that once they move over, like a nets suite, then we can start working with them, but we typically do those consolidation, but they you both have to be in Quickbooks or zero or something else.

Client 2: Okay. Twenty it what where we are going to move to reports?

Client 2: Oh.

Host 1: Awesome.

Client 2: And and this is gonna be in the should be in the second or third the quarter that wouldn't twenty three.

Host 1: Cool.

Client 2: Okay. So I believe in the future, maybe at the end of next year, it's gonna be feed to our systems.

Host 1: Yeah. No. Let's definitely do that because I know nets we in integration or implementation can take a while. So I'll definitely check when you guys you know, middle half or end of next year. And I also don't wanna dollars i'm because like, the part is changing so quickly that wanna make sure we show it to you in a place where you guys would actually utilize it. So Appreciate you jumping on. Sorry that, you know, can't help you guys today, but we'll keep tabs and keep in touch then get back in touch where it makes sense.

Client 2: Okay. Just a curious, what is the price for the system?

Host 1: Well, it It is changing in January. So I don't wanna tell you something and then changes, but I will say, like, we're, like like, high twenties low thirties as of today, for the full system, but this really should be like your full suite of software staff or, like, bringing in your Crm, your Erp, your billing and your Hr system. All into one and getting it a spreadsheet. So we're like, kind of in the middle ground between a full enterprise solution and, like, a spreadsheet plug in. It's kinda like a gold lock solution for companies of your size.

Client 2: Okay. So it's about twenty to thirteen Yep.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 2: Cool.

Client 2: And thank you for the time.

Host 1: And yeah.

Client 2: Touch can oh yeah next year.

Host 1: Sounds good. Have a great rest of your year and New year and talk soon.
