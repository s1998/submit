Host 1: You didn't miss a lot.

Client 3: Yeah. It number is.

Client 2: Second I gotta fix my resolution. It's like we Cool. That's fine give a few minutes. Anybody non answered that thanksgiving side? George you did. Right?

Client 4: Just just one play a single figure of mashed potatoes in a middle bill like a.

Client 4: Just all the top. That's the only thing.

Client 2: Cool. Sorry. Guys. Need need to use set issues done kick things off. How do get yours?

Client 5: No. I like... So I wasn't a big fan of stuffing. Until I tried my mother law's, and she makes it like, the old school from scratch with, like, the cut or whatever and, like, fries. And I was like this sounds so good. And I she sticks it in like the Turkey, like... And then I had a bite of it, and I was like, oh, my lord. This that's why everyone's obsessed stuff making. Because i always that like that. Mom always did like the box. Why i'm sorry she was like be made and, like, you should said put water it. You know, it's like But... Yeah. So stepping, Nice new bay right now.

Client 5: Weather lost My favorite, well from this thanksgiving getting at least was some like corn brand stuff?

Client 2: So it's pretty much a normal stuff. We got some more kind soon. It was pretty good. Probably i makes some even less healthier in the other, but pretty good. Cool. Alright. Think about the new Tv Rocking here. Should be good? I'll start to share my screen. Did it. That's sorry one second. So Done Okay.

Client 2: Can you guys see the main slides not giving me the orange box or the green box.

Client 6: See how on my end.

Host 1: It says Denisha has charged started sharing screen sharing, but it doesn't show anything.

Client 2: We're try. We just entire Tv if that works.

Client 7: Yeah. Yeah to go.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Alright. Let me get your face on Tv else here. Awesome. Cool something guys. All numbers update we got and this miscellaneous updates some December strategies stuff and then we'll go the trackers pretty here, but First wanted to recap everyone on November. So I heard one individually this already, but back. Just sitting announcement, basing on. So is out to be our third best month ever in a month where I certainly was worried about less several days. And anytime we have two days off and probably a day two on side of it where our prospects are very consistently taking off time. You know, there was some mass education. On where we're gonna finish. But to pretty much just close a hundred and fifty came more than last month to month in which I think we to a pretty good start given the previous month being very successful and also two dc gdpr outbound mix in our bookings there at the bottom left. Just really really impressive all the way around and sets us up for, you know, very likely our best wherever. And now it's probably hitting that best quarter every mark, but more about a how can we just blow a little it off we'll give into that here in a second. Submit contribution on the month Selwyn hundred thirty four k I just absolutely just wacky nick. Fourteen prior hundred eleven. Well, there's nine seven five a couple types of slips but she got some stuff have far probably the next couple business days. Evan hit not rang quota with an nineteen twenty five k deal. So Yeah. Longer guys just great work. I mean, I I've mentioned this to you before, but the urgency that we approach our cycles, not just from when we get interest in a later on from the very beginning is super super important and think because been a huge piece of our success is just that really consistent dealer execution kind of, you know, stays for auburn. Know obviously we're doing a ton of things around conversion, and I'll possibly empty to emphasis for us, but that stage conversion and working on a mixed with the execution we're seeing up know, tap down the funnel. It's really where the model starts to get pretty impressive as far we can contribute. And then not without, you know, more excited is the top right there or hours go amount. So I think are like, twenty three seven or something like that right now. Some gotta round it up for us here, but You know, what's really impressive if you're outside of just this number is that when you actually break it down and you look at deals greater than certain threshold like new Agreements going during the twenty five thirty plus Those have absolutely shot up. What's really pulled this down as been some of our deals in the teens. So, you know, obviously, that's business that in each case was we had to do to win the business I feel strongly on that, but Just work keep in mind to hey, if we can get this to that twenty five K mark so higher by end of year. It completely has a a compounding effect for how outside part us and frankly for the efficiency that we hard to close our quality I hired deal size is really, really awesome. Also regarding to that this is a month in which we this a lot of of scoping requirements because start deals, We'll talk about always ways need to continue to further out later in this meeting. But to still not have that slow down our contribution in a significant way is is awesome to see On the bottom right there the call conversion side, I've changed a little bit of the view on this we were gonna just stand reporting in the previous few weeks. I think move forward all the portal on like to train in a couple months. Then just like with it remember most recent week, looks like a two big look back in the previous flip back. So Take a look at where you're got there obviously, something there we're continuing continuously trying to improve and you find yourself carriers, just now that's still something that you're... you know, should the point of emphasis for you. Something that you can take the volumes from those or are doing better continue attack to some one lines know discovery calls and, you know, that early stage deal management is what we're primarily working on. So now continue to keep it in important emphasis to that because I think these numbers if we're a little bit better on in the bottom right here. It looks much, you know, more impressive despite the fact that already in a very good spot. So continue to hit harder. Go. You questions here on that november pops? Looking at the four update here. So I left the the I was put my hair top right, but left hand side stuff, Selwyn leading the group here, custom absolutely massive mass porter accelerators are in play and that'll just cops that I looking for that one. You see their work where cascade down. On the bookings of mount. So we mentioned this earlier rat. Five right now solid. It's a no brainer that we should exceed that Q mark. You know, that would only require us concerning a, you know, small fraction so. Well, we'll do some goal setting here in a bit, but something that really puts us stuff in an awesome awesome spot. And as we know this hate four k is we could just got some more volume k. On right, I didn't want flags and version two stage one, typically in the q four time frame here. So we're looking at... This still includes deals that are have yet to be converted, but essentially looking at Twenty seven four inbound and twenty for outbound. We sent an outbound goal to be that mid twenties range. So it's good to see that improvement. We're still kind of where at. So there's still a lot of type so, I can move this up and I feel strong that we can do better right if we continuing to improve, but it is nice to see a little bit more return to normal in that figure. Swear we're at in three. Cool Step update. So first of all, chad make for in the the buy created in twenty five k. So awesome steve, still the cell love that. I mean, I think we're gonna the key to nick success quarterly has been just higher deal size. And still get its transactions there's you know, much less than than no else, but he's right know the packet of bookings and some good stuff working. So Yeah. Ac are not just a drive for business, but a a key lever in and how you guys will it accelerators. Those four Tom three Rabindranath two and net line. So Honestly, I wonder seems like they got a real shot at him this buy at the end of the quarter. So let's keep this strong and again, that's this is a huge piece of the business. So if you ever feel like you're in a tough Case speech situation flies in me and, you know, you're let's let's jump dive into it. Wanted to talk a little about a December strategy some of this will be a little bit similar to November because it's a very similar challenge. Almost really similar in the sense that it's like, we have basically of three release. Still didn't wanna flag this, is said, we know, we did have some slips. Despite doing this, I think pretty well last month. We did have some slips that I would describe on our prospect side. Where, you know, they had a a Ceo who's got a office or something who wasn't able to approve or yeah. Their legal stepped in despite, you know, them not thinking they needed review So I kind at least bought two or three those deals. You know, we build perfect here, but it's definitely very, very helpful full too especially you at this point. Like can the a deal that can see can cause in model, like asking these by students. Whether it's an additional touch or on a call it's absolutely mandatory. Otherwise, we're at the well of how lot of prospect up and so internally, which as we know, it's not it's supposed have way. So would encourage you guys kind have any deals that are likely send this note over to the top. You you do this in a consultative way, we mentioned last meeting, like, if people will do this asleep you say hey, you, think about, you know, your guys projects here I wanted to planning my... you know, my team's internal review, You know, i wanted to confirm a few questions in of office, and things to be aware. I mean, i just move around, like, This could come off healthy. I went positioned correctly and certainly went over the song. Cool. Pricing changes. I send the email today like a couple of things here, I think you were earnings from some calls. I'd realize that we're still waiting for the full price to roll out. We don't know what that's gonna be fully at we have a good idea it's something where there's gonna be some last minute details that are ironed out And you all I said was a way to give give you guys some framework for what that could look like. But I've noticed some some calls where we start to mention all la carte pricing or things like that, but prospects starts to wonder if there's a way to like find a pathway for itself being a lesser deal. So it's it's a little bit weird, but I encourage you guys to when you messaged this. Also mentioned the first and foremost prices are increasing as part of on If you make just outlining because you're trying to soften the message, now they're we wondering well, hey, you don't want head reconciliation. We don't want you, half consolidation and they start thinking they can, like, you know, carpet on packaging. So keep that in mind, i mentioned that prices are increasing and doing some refund of products that will mean that you're not grandfather to the full platform. So as eye gel. The email you guys a couple of people who specifically ask, like a player or two to run for some certain deals. So that's why i some i. But not exactly how to look and, you know in full fashion I said i can mail out some people express enough from Frodo to helped on this just for different situations. Is there still have out Like, anyone want basically, simpler message point out from Frodo to the team just for maybe different audience or Something.

Host 1: Yes.

Client 2: Yes.

Client 7: Yeah. Definitely.

Client 2: Just one. Just note about how the email. It says, like, We'll have full details to next week. I'm gonna take that out that if it's just so we night. Wait So... Yeah. A call. I'll send idea. I again if you want iteration of that, that was just one to a couple people ask some calls today. Let me know you send a new line. They're gonna forward it. Feel free to delete it. Adding do you stuff because it will be like a different color in in G suite emails so just be very careful not the delete stuff of that works. We just find that on the. Perfect. So we'll get the strategies section here in second, but this would be a key play for strat sessions. Like, the way that, like, a c level wrap does and they say pricing changing here you guys sign. The way that we've been more sophisticated in our emergency plays, I think it's been a huge reason why we're executing more effectively. You know, dressing up slightly with, you know, note from Frodo kinda called out, maybe a specific space for the customer and why they would make sense for to sign now based on the remodeling or something along those lines like it that slightest of creativity really helps also slam well it makes not seem like hey who's saying the same thing they hear time time again. So we should think of this as a key urgency play but also the tells underneath that should be well thought out. So again, what I said is probably, like, a generic, you know, version let me know if you wanted more procurement job to strategy sessions. So Cool. Any thoughts on pricing changes one, likely January, but any questions there. Yeah. Just. For price changes. I was just curious that I'll how many variables are we gonna introduce it would actually... Like, isn't actually gonna be, like, pricing plus scaling, plus a la carte, I was just wondering what that kinda of looking like I did this. So this way to send in nvidia Door wind up on this family the that like a packaging a lot of different tiers. And then part here is features function but also the data still is a part of it. So It's to be relatively two days. It's just but then the all the carte nature is the the the products but each of those tiers. Is my current understanding, but this is also moving very quickly.

Client 4: Brian's gonna do, like a preview session feedback session with all the Aes. In December so you guys will kinda get like a first look and get a handle on it, but what Denisha that is. A good way to think about it. Hey I guess question on just early deadlines. Did a lot of did anyone or a good handful of people watch how to drive urgency or log video.

Client 2: Never I watching it yet. But so i we were just on the sales floor to start playing my computer's not later, but having one year.

Client 4: Nice. There's a really good piece. I think it's, like around minute thirty or forty. I just dropped a screenshot shot. Of the slide. There where basically that talks about like kinda drive urgency, and there's, like, kind of the strategies of like, oh, like, you know, pricing changes, like, Cs availability, It's like, then it's, like, the alternative, like, tying it back to the blob training around, like, rather than doing that. You like, the defines, like demand side or see like, cost action, compelling events, negative consequences. So I guess those people like start to think kinda like drive emergency of December definitely encourage people to like, take a look at that section. Because I thought that was the the best piece of it. Could be helpful for upcoming deals.

Client 2: Totally. Yeah. I'll got a lot back and definitely a big thought raised and anytime you can tie it to specific situation and not just... What's happening Analyst egg is, yeah, Definitely first and foremost us and particularly our finance folks and everything thinking i'll staying up their model, all different cases they have. If we can line to that, that's that's fundamental enough for sure. Take a look at that some doug. I you guys to same. Cool. Strategy session. So we bought least of monday tuesday the execute while some time to include their pipeline tax to deals and then send back then. I'll I'll pause them and ping template just for the sake of of time we can keep moving. But it's pretty straightforward. So the library already compiled. It's just like excel sheet. What's the deals know let's say inbound our outbound, pretty much what you're doing on the cash sheet realistically. Call hey, was the current status for post play, and I just have some sections for notes. So pretty straightforward stuff. Again, I'm gonna look into it so take a time here, but I will send this out afterwards. Please populate that with the current deals station you have. It's also on sheet for looking for ideas or something creative, we can access errors and see what they they're doing. So this way of structure really can easier for you guys. I'll now afterwards, and then get be on Monday, tuesday. Kind of boss up i any chat possession plays, you guys have that resonate well, and I think we're getting good job of none what those look like, but anything just maybe behind a scenes that you didn't share with anyone and or something that's where we're flagging here? I I'd say you it's slightly not totally pricing plays related, but before getting into pricing, which is verifying fine, but you wanna go to this you buy this? Before jumping into negotiations, like on that was. I didn't quarterly was like, we gave up too much easier like i said, they can get it approved, but didn't get that like So just we're actually giving you anything on pricing, making sure that they We don't have the vendor at choice. Because of add once dad's done, that it's a lot easier to drop this online so where so is switch address. Yeah. I'm in you're position strength, you know you know, Is this price matter not such and position strength it's much so different Cool. Anything else?

Client 8: Yeah. For for me, just understanding too if it's competitive, where people are coming in at price wise, and then setting up those calls to better understand how they're gonna make their decision and what else is left. Because then it sort can lead to you know, is price gonna be the ultimate factor in your decision or or it is Mosaic stacked like, all those things kind of factor into how aggressive you have to be at then. So that's just worked well for me knowing if it's competitive. Or not Hold on.

Client 2: Yeah. That's a key it input for us now for approval on a smaller It's like, I mean, throughput every deal. So I think it actually literally well was deal since one he had competitive players in play who were just absolutely in, like, the low teens or even like high like single digits. So Yeah. It's a key input for our of all.

Client 5: I was on this pre sales like webinar with, like, three hundred sales and pre sales leaders, like don't know months ago and they're talking about champions. Right, and how can identify champion and give them enough collateral to sell internally. Can we put too much trust in those champions I think i mean, everyone basically admitted, like, we could always do a better job of educating the Champion because they, are not trained in selling. Don't know how to pitch They don't know mosaic enough. It's just something to consider especially for December, you identify a Champion, you give them, like an Roi template. But also, Like taught me go a step further debt to really help them sell internally especially signing up.

Client 2: Yeah. It's a good call. I didn't actually address that made of this here, but we've had a lot of success with, like, putting me together these even somewhat rough business cases for folks, how twilio resonated. I think of at least a couple of deals where we did that that that very helpful and we schedule calls around it it's touch. Like it it really drove a out of conversation. So That's a good call. Yeah. In our strategy sessions I would also think about that guy around. If there's anything that think chandler need to enable or even I mean, high level stakeholders need to make the case that is Definitely top of mind. And and we've seen that too. I think some of our tough losses last month. In November we're go to kind of last minute Denisha doesn't seem like you guys are the best Internet connection Yeah.

Client 5: I I get the same thing where he's cutting out.

Client 2: Yeah we've got the unstable note. How this sound now?

Host 1: It's fine now but it happened twice sorry.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah. Fact goes out. we can turn our camera off if we need to... Like i let me know more time because does that. Cool. We good now.

Host 1: Yeah. Just thinking more for, like, demos, and if you guys arguing going demos from the office?

Client 2: Yeah they're on the case. Sorry right cannot.

Host 1: Cool.

Client 2: Yeah. We had a pretty challenge earlier, but i hopefully will be good for us this minute. It's slow trying again they'll let me know. I'll just the camera. see so. One is quickly fax into new content? I think this is this is important for December I was kinda buried in the sales watch manual during the last day of the month. So i wanna flag it here. We got some very important product releases coming up. We obviously see that we have material on some other ones who discuss like, query engine and all that. But We do have the product release highlights that's an external deck that's in that sales channel. Good at visuals shows product screenshots shot. So much better than just it If you're ever handling any these objections, you guys send this stuff out or if it's reaching out to a prospect to the on the vendor level, you know, close loss list. Like, again, some collateral way up more helpful than just speaking to it. Permissions and some head count planning updates are also on there So... Yeah. Please take a look at that. We also have police webinar on December fourteenth that's we got great feedback on last time and and definitely influenced a lot of deal let's you nodding so. Yeah. That was a a huge one. So that's all bob and Brian's note in the sales slack channel. Was also the one that many dental, which is on another slide here in a second, but i'll i now just sick of what for going on.

Host 1: I have have question on that.

Host 1: Might be a good question for Frodo as well, but I'm a little bit hesitant to send out that head count video because it says it's top down, but it's really just bulk bottoms up. And I feel like a lot of people who've given us the objection of tops down arr our goals and then for us to tell them how many people they need. So I just know that people who I've talked that that's been a deal killer for have like, the driver base where I think we had, like, a whiskey of video where it was like, for every Ae, we want one Cs or, like, two Sdr or or something like was a lot more impactful than like, the bulk import or yeah. Just like doing more roles based on number and month. Do we know when, like, full top down dynamic account? Drivers will be released.

Client 6: I don't know. This was the first step to do in the driver based plans, but You're right. It's not driver based head count. It's it's more tops down. Still think it'll resonate with people if he showed to them, but it's it's definitely not the the driver based thing that you're talking about.

Host 1: So... Okay. So maybe I'm incorrect. Is that tops down though? Because, like, it says tops down in the video. I thought tops down was like, Arr down to head count.

Client 6: That's that's, like using a driver. So you know an Arr our goal and you say if I'm meet ten million in Arr, I need ten reps. That's, like a driver based head count. Pops down is at the end of the year, we know we wanna be a hundred people, but we don't exactly what the makeup of those people will be.

Client 6: We need to add fifty people into the model.

Host 1: Got is okay. That's good to know.

Client 2: With... I said, it's it this isn't being improved yet for large larger your company's making discuss like states that the copy paste you do a lot of things. So it's helping with larger companies that are adding more at the town, but it's not... Yeah. It's not that here. At that point. So just how i assist it, But it's definitely helpful.

Client 2: Step right direction.

Client 5: Cool.

Client 2: Sorry. I'll go.

Client 5: I don't think that's gonna be coming up until probably q two where it's like true like you know, driver based off of revenue, and then it just produces you need you know, twenty reps to support that new revenue line. But I know I know they're working on incorporating the the role like, that the tops down role, like head account count so that you can pull it into top line. And then it could be really dynamic where you go. I got these roles with the salary band. Then I can go ahead and reply a ratio and start doing it all top line. So there's ways to to combat that. We can do it within top line.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah. I was wondering is I like a pretty legit around or is that one of those side hands. So now it's gonna be pretty legit. I think like, we have you need this many aes. You have that in a row that's up on model, just copying paste at a row. Five month into that like, four eighty four masks. Yeah. And they're good to go or just being like, hey, you know, it needs six in July thousand four rows. Okay. So think if we can talk her. Definitely We can work Yeah.

Client 5: We work the magic. I think with with a couple things already.

Client 6: Yeah. Can you guys limit? That sounds really cool?

Client 2: Right? Yeah. Seems like the work.

Client 6: We would.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah.

Client 5: Yep. I got Denisha.

Client 8: Yeah. Yep.

Client 2: Also up updates on the competitor piece says internet and stay got they alert. You guys get.

Host 1: Yeah. We lost you for a sec.

Client 2: Alright. I'm thinking the video. Sorry. I can't see Maximus is billable face. So competitor objections and now, aren't gonna get a some goes up. I'll I'll dial. So Let this is up a hashtag for this. We already have hashtag competitor. That's still like competitor, like, you know, like, features that we don't have. I I kinda thought too long about this and I just held on competition. It's was like, way to track actions. Phil has a better idea. Let me know We haven't started doing this yet. But I think that works for now, competition. Just like the single meeting impact. I I think it's been really helpful to just see and it goes. You guys have trouble you got a success like flagging in is is super helpful. Jericho, and I are to to watching more disco on recurring basis with focus on paying. You know, that would lot of the or last stuff we did. And then now competition. So Please tag those up, Sharon as a team, you know, we'll also have the at G team as well to surface that to everyone. Particularly populate these guys, because it's gonna be helpful for us have some more coming on this as well around Some slight items liquid can competitor cheat sheet that just really tee up like best practice liner? And then the tiny data will accompany that i I gotta press not make it more egg branded, but I'll send this as well on it will include that kinda, you know, once you do that first one liner how tied to their pain and that kind newer process that we introduced a couple of weeks to ago. So work time here with still on Reiterate. This is a a is for at competition increasing or competitor or attacking more ever and be kinda have that Like I think, Frodo said it perfectly where it's like, we have to counter people's words with, you know, products features now. So how we use our runs back is a is a helpful band as well. I don't think else recall, but it could be helpful also a korean that can say normally, And you like my battle card, but before we just started down up especially notes it's about Just like this is what gonna. They're gonna gonna say can't do top line they're gonna say we don't have let us here I can say we can't create different data sources. And it helps kinda like, reduce that credibility if they're attacking us on the lines we can how we can do that. So getting of it kinda like helps so my competition deal interesting Yeah. I should a previous. I let that him lot here this is successful that is the system all. Trying to I it. I'll try do it now. Yeah. All good. Yeah. I know I'm happen stop here. But that's a good call. I mean, I I we thought one different things our competitors and we talked about is that like, when someone's wrong without against Mosaic, it comes off. Very poorly and it's kinda one those gotcha moments and then use competitors often both how up you speak to our competition and maybe how we can kinda pre them what they gonna hear. Our competition, that's a that's a great call. Call. Alright. Most important in December strategy of all standard joking, is I wanna since our team global prize. We have a certain goal working with George what that goal is, we just wrapped up a the month, look at that not to everyone my end of day. But I think we'll... Start with Jorge will do some like, custom slack for the group. Like, Just I don't know i don't wanna perhaps to make my own ideas because this is meant to source feedback thinking, like Thirty evs are already out automatic quarters of Jackets something like that be unique to the sales team have some M brand. Someone like goes lines and have reference for. Type clothing or recommendation and maybe something you've done in the past that school.

Host 1: So a pants.

Client 2: Right now. Okay. Gotta like that to work home i'm like jeans. Yeah. There go.

Client 7: And one of the v. I think we were talking about that a few days ago, Frodo.

Client 2: There you go. I didn't think I got nice. Something did not I mean, brian it's my. Cool. Yeah. I'll saying I see based something could be cool. I guess the got on that same level.

Host 1: And there's all brands Sorry.

Host 1: I have, like, a million jackets.

Client 2: Thank. Blankets not What's the traffic?

Client 2: Would be nice.

Client 5: Went.

Client 2: Hey. Okay. She may have this a friday day. I'm gonna start looking line my some stuff for us that if we our stretch goal we'll get these of that's already in play for Ac and whatnot. So yeah. We'll get good create for make sure something where we're actually looking forward to. So all set options around. And place send the me any thoughts, but keep me there Cool. So these size items are gonna this one minute demo. Next session is December twentieth. We do have some help on the Str sdr side template outreach and for getting the lips more quickly. We had a balance. Probably three ball aspects one last one. But was very much to draw on it to be expressed. We didn't do a ton outreach around it. But Yes are is time. I believe I have to check them with marketing for doing a push on this this one, I know they are in the future is gonna help drive more attendance towards it. And then we'll have have some ways to just set out reach more quickly afterwards. Worth noting that it's december outreach, you know, probably and very much should be instant by the custom note over the top on top of it, but a good way to kind check ins so not having to recreate the wheel time we do one of these. And this link, bookmark is, this is the same for everyone who's moving forward. Very easy to set out and spread awareness on this, you know, baking in a docs if you want, you can see is click... But definitely helpful to to get this out to all our prospects. We press before says a reminder this is not to replace custom demo if you think the custom demo is better in any way than schedule that, It's just for maybe a prospect who's holding up a deal because they want take peek or our someone who maybe was, you know, Borderline line qualified, but you didn't wanna, you know, just say no when you can never check on To something along those lines. So We'll keep the list on two attend. I'll give us some earnings on what types of alliances are showing up for these, but but without follow my prospects doing the last one and filing well. We also are innovating long this flow a little bit and ten hour our position Mosaic. So iterating line and new session. But, yeah. I did wanna make sure we're spraying on. Cool. Contact back. Hi. I just want to fly this at And we... You know, I know you got there doing this on basis, but look to forecast December, please ensure closed dates to amounts the sales stages whether it's open to close, all that needs to be accurate. One thing too to know is that we're seeing some scale ops, you know, call it open for a hundred plus days whatever. In our pipeline. Not the time, but enough where it forms a flag. So This intelligence us out, we want our days to close to reflected of our total notion and not be just the case of you to something out not shows it to be your close. I can really drag on our average and when we were modeling out can you can have a big effect. So Please if having those go ahead and and close us out I will start to feed you guys in some of these by end day tomorrow, and then by Monday roll it up and by I should say the Monday weekly sync on pipeline. Please have this ironed out, so we're not speaking to five hundred, the rather working on sales. It's is there just like a number like, it it's bullet blank? Should just close it Like I'm just thinking that kind of a case example but I've been talking to it. Plans for a long time. But is there should we just say, like, you don't want anything why in ninety or sixty or something? Good question. I mean, my thought is that We also don't wanna be to close something out and close one it and two days sounds like low in the next week to no next step within forty five days. And that's good can confirm next step. Eligible for close. Then tell you to check back next month and maybe they do respond well whatever. It's like not enough it least used to be like, a real, you know, call schedule. So probably a little be case by case, but I'd say anything once about a hundred days. Is a clear see like this has now been in the pipeline so, you know, almost double close. But I'll i'll to you guys chat on my individually. regular dot com. Just want go back this. Part of us trying to be good on Slack com, one of the when this rolled out a few months ago was just around, like, making can show the audience when you ping you a large group. If you could go on more specific to the Ot, please do so. Wanna die in general being crystal also give me first a lot of questions that I'm seeing like getting service to like you know, Cs sales chat that are pretty, like, flat out questions that I could answer for you more quickly rather than going into like service Cs and that's channel. Maybe I don't check super often where i messages and you guys I'm caveat on as since possible. So pretty to ping me first, it's like gonna be first line advanced from your. I talking had needs to be this us when everything thinking all you guys for stuff and my hey just front that's meeting and I can be the filter because it's lost out of like for you. So Just wanna call us out. Obviously, feel pretty paying great team you guys need to. But if you think is something I can answer first, probably get it work quickly you than talking out to a big group where responsibility you'll be just used today.

Host 1: Just note from that. Because I know I do that a lot.

Host 1: Sometimes, Caleb tell me to slack it out because he wants everyone else to also know. So I... That's kind of like why I do it is I want like, knowledge sharing, but some of them definitely I could direct towards you, but is there like a is there like a role like I mean, I would say if the goal is to keep contact for the group in a helpful situation bill free I don't really have a good framework to to, like, line further.

Client 2: Would say hey, feel free just pay me for, like, questions are top of your demo and if it's something that... Yeah. A good the group. And Ken dawson to send it out feel briefing. So I can call it out as you guys not big issue you guys... I thought I think we can iron out to create a less noise. So Yeah.

Client 5: Let's are you talking about like, technical type of questions.

Client 2: To cs. I'm talking about, like, the Slack like Cs you know that says like, where's is the onboarding pickup tracker? Like know stuff like that. Yeah It's it's more symbolic true, but, like just super lighting questions that I can address. Not not big problem. Guys just wanna sign something that the companies working to be better. Let's scale out while still all on cycle all day for not real a bit. Scoping. So is a a big piece of this call. It's something the last few things we talked about today. So We've definitely a lot of improvements here. I appreciate the mindset on scoping that see from everyone it's clear that they starting to identify these. What really just not flag this again is that it's the consistency of addressing this that it needs to be better and also we can couple changes in Salesforce to account for this. So Just one very that for scoping. What you mean by this is that every deal goes through scoping. When we talk about scoping I wanna know longer thinking it as, like, a stop call, those no longer person synonymous this it is scoping as a functions that we go through to make sure that we called it's not gonna go churn, you know, immediately or turn or something like that. So a Share ownership about this. As, however, have be clear technical the mindset and can calls out out and have also the science experts used to know what these potential yellow and bright flags may that maybe we didn't catch. So our case is definitely organizers to own far as, like, flagging them your deals, but hey, similarly your about close transaction, make runs you're s Still you saw Yesterday, there is now a mandatory checkbox in there, it's no longer a clickable, but the eight the S now owns this. Sorry. I'm triggering it yesterday. It was supposed to be kinda order out today, but essentially what we want to be done here is that what a deal well really from the start of a deal, but certainly before a deal hits four k, see the technology I run through the sales teams stack i'll pull up here in second. And discussed do happen met these technical hurdles? Have we validated model dimensions and there's maybe a couple of lines don't want us to slow on deal velocity, but again, guys this is something that has matter for customer health for avoiding and, you know, deals getting turned out. And frankly, it's a level of detail that our our competitors do. So we need to be all over it. So again, the process here is you know, from discovery, as you probably watching your discovery talk prepping for the demo start of line of still red flags and more your talk. You know, all the data validate that the data mapping section And then future calls, all that. It should be continuous process. But then have very least prior states for you know because the yes will have to check that box. They're gonna be asking you like, well, hey, have we gone through this I just guys call me to mount this out. And then from there, determine, we need to interface this in the data team. Has not always been straight at scoping call, but rather Send to Cal team, explaining what the situation is something you can use Cs validation somewhere I leads to the implementation calculator here because if they're they needed to timeline a request, go buy time frame also validate that there. And in general, just know what we're drawing the hard lines moving before hard line speed that you guys are are still accountable for this. Because of this now box is forced to go through another party. Checking it when you comment done this, we'll would be not being front to the business. That's the worst thing you can do. So please take this very seriously. And so now a point of that believe for us and it's just totally necessary to ensure we have good retention as we discussed in the islands yesterday, attention is one of the biggest things in the business that we need to improve. And it really does start with us. And I would probably argue that we're as influential as Cs team and sure that number goes out. So I'll pause there. I realized that this is, you know, something have laid out for, but it's a new wrinkle. Something think that's, you know, very much you know, newly reinforced so any questions calls here It'd be helpful from the data team if we could get like, almost like a typically needs a call, typically doesn't eat a call because, like, Pretty much every time I've sent the anything that didn't seem like it would be that big of a deal.

Host 1: They wanna call, and it's they're asking questions that I wouldn't thing to ask. So just like even knowing what to look out or aside from because like, all those things are yellow flags and that means, hey, send loom. But doesn't mean Hey Saint Loom probably gonna be a call or case loom. And it's probably fine. So I I I would appreciate more detail here as far as, like, If there are yellow flags, one would not need a call.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair. I think the reason why this runs through them is that it's naturally so custom. As far as, like, why they they wanna Take the call? And basically, what your calling out we'll be documenting their entire process and that's something that we kind of done on their side. So you have to think about it? It's a fair call though. If you feel like you're... you know, you could've have set a next step that you did it and now doing your deal a couple days. Then determine the scoping calls if necessary. Please flag that to me. But No. The because. Like bond to that. I think... It's a balance between making can sure you guys have predictability, but also not make do the data team job and therefore maybe doing it not as well as anything have? But i'll talking the sales, which should hopefully please that up four you as far ago. Relatively to healthy. Foundation, But, yeah. Let to that one i'll pull the sales actually show what's document today here in a second.

Client 5: Hey Leaandra. Just on that node too. I mean, you just rely on the S mark because we're that bridge. To the technical, and we can get provide you guidance. I mean, we're listening here discovery call. To be honest that's probably eighty percent of whether I can understand or Maximus will understand this needs a scoping call or a living call. And then after the first demo, should be a hundred percent sure of what that requires whether it's a scoping call. Or in video. So just check in with Maximus and be like, hey, what do you think we should do here? I bet you can answer it within five minutes. For that. So mean, this this gets more technical as as the product gets more experienced. Just need a and a plan fan. As he's actually out Right. Own this entire process. So just something think about.

Client 2: Yeah. Took two long calls. That worry about deal blah Like, you don't know if that should schedule us scope or not and then you have to send a limit afterwards. I take go ahead and schedule the call. Can call the scoping call or whatever. And then if you the pull it later, you can if you just stay team go. So actually you're fully fine. You could pull it or not have a call schedule your prospect to check it again and just say we the data team you're all set here they told us like, It could still be a touch point that is another step that makes all that they don't get them in on. So I mean, you about the boss i said, look at the next meeting and that may be the doesn't need to join. Is also another option for you.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, why... I'm I'm actually not worried about deal Velocity. I'm definitely not against scoping calls, I just don't like, having, like, gray areas of, like, not really sure of how I should be positioning things. And I also would like to understand, like, When we have a scoping call, is it just the data team is aware of what's on the pipeline or is there actual chance they might say No.

Client 2: I I think what crazy Caleb expressed is they wanna set right expectations. For revenue data. So any data that doesn't live bit. Sales for most file. So, like, in an on standard build, they wanna ensure that they're gonna be able to calculate it the correct way do it the type of the manner. Let me do implement and I think just the expectation setting. And understanding of our rules or gaps in the person's data is the biggest thing for that. Yeah. And for as far as it we'll say no Leaandra, Caleb and Gertude, you they're pretty clear on this that it's not their place. It's also to not pursue be a that's a rather and form of the race if we do close one. I think Kelly even kind of finally told me one time is like, only said milligrams some when I said i know. I kinda say it was okay to close anyway know, I really want it too. So it's like he's not gonna tell us pursuit deal but it'll really layout out is what's risk step doing so. What's an expectation we to set. For example, I called Crazy recently where it's pretty messy. I we built of custom metrics and She totally happy us supposed a dealing, but all she wanted to caution well is expect it's doesn't to matter to take an extra for few weeks and expect this dataset to take an extra the prospect appreciate the clarity and that was about it. So that's something thing I just couldn't have spoken to you because I couldn't have no color was configured and what types of, you know data they're interfacing and all the past stuff. So Yeah. I a good call. I think you can do very is too much the file. Say if it's something blue you want and gets bigger. But let me think more about that. But I'll jump the sales cadence now just make sure we have time to I on this guy because there first got updates to it. The. That sound good.

Host 1: Yep. Perfect.

Client 2: Oh, do you guys see the sales stuck here?

Client 2: Not yet. I got a weird notification give one second. This it was tried again here. With last time. There we go. You see that out.

Host 1: Yep Perfect.

Client 2: So I'll this to Text. We'll send it out there everyone afterwards, but This is the list that... And and really, this should be a pretty easy cadence especially had a couple calls across back you know, see down your determine okay, what the key metrics attributes they needed? You know, hey, but all seem straightforward we're good. If it past metrics and we got interface data team, weird business model definitely gotta sit down and see what if that makes sense and get the s you sign off subs particularly big thing to call out here and kinda of i'll taking quickly just like a time, but basically take look at this. Started planning across this, we've been burn on this recently. So a very, very important most things that, like they sign on on first call, then we glad it can't do it, and it's just like, by hug as get. So Very, very important multiple currencies. Wanna talk with a lot lately guys, week we can flip between and application that you have one functional reporting currency. If two, absolutely needs to be scalable, and there's a lot of Nuance here So very much needs to be called out does that bill out date got the time my calculator for that? Would also caution that if it's extremely sensitive for that. And like continual success of the project. The calculator probably is not enough he's maybe surface staff to your see they'll try hear our to do so. To Arr arr third party connectors, the dimensions want plan by. Nuances fighting process is probably like hey is there any bigger, you know, sql allocations or something more nuance your asking would flag. Data blind this do absolutely important if you know they have you know, transactional business or a b2c compliant over self serve component, all that definitely we're vetting out and then just create quality issues they expressed it click as bad or Salesforce isn't an absolutely mess, but they sold drive error from it. That's all be necessary. Thought when the you see this list are probably like we are prior now they'll just talking into something to validate, but You're gonna quick just gonna call, tell you hey. This makes sense her interface the date seemed Potentially, or hey we're all set, let's work for here. So really the process guys. Obviously there's some additional substantially docs here around, like, what to to think about some additional laws here, but send this out, please again I take a look at this guys and just know that we're all this part.

Client 4: Yeah. Maybe just to they, like, super clear on, like, how that should go and and, like, what the x expectation is there? Like, thought is every single deal, like, you and your asking, you should sit down, look at those two slides. Plus all the yellow flags and, like, literally go through every single bullet point, and be like Once... Like getting, thoughts on this, Do need to check it on this. So we all good here. And only after like, you've had that conversation, and it should be like a conversation, not just like a slack message. Then is it like, okay. Like, as an Ae, I have done my job met my expectation to like, go to the S and and get their sign off. And then the S i can go into Salesforce, check the box at scoping has been completed to that expectation. And now like, you're you're both right your name that this process has been followed So like just quick wanna make sure that, like, that's very clearly communicated like, that's happening a hundred percent of deals just so like, we don't have any more issues with known problems like, there always be things that the pop up. Like, okay, you know, at this actually wasn't the deck, we can add it, like, whatever it is. That's totally fine. But if we keep seeing, like, known issues become problems for Cs. We're just gonna have to put in more process more roadblocks until we get it right. I don't think anyone wants to go to a world where scoping a hundred percent of our calls. It's like you're having, like what setting up meetings with the teams to go through the last, like, there's a lot that we could do to get this right that we don't really wanna do. But if we can't nail it, just What it is today that mike will continue putting in more roadblocks more slowdown, which i don't think anyone wants. So definitely please do take this seriously like, cs anytime they get in the call, and they don't know there's a, like, multi currency issue. It's like a tough look for them. They hate it. Be a lot of their life. Spend trying to fix those issues. So please do take this seriously sit down the s every single time, have the conversation, and only that check the box. Hopefully, you know, also set from there, but Yeah. Let me just again. Definitely definitely taking this super seriously going forward.

Host 1: George question for you. If there is something like a business model that we can't support or like, I I don't know if remember that conversation but kayla Cad was pretty much like, hey, we can't really do this right now. Shouldn't set the expectation that we can with top line. And that's important to them. Would that be a disqualified deal or close loss?

Client 4: No. So... Yeah. I think I was gonna flag this. I think it's I think this company handful of times the last couple weeks like, hey, gray area. What's goes last what's I think we should just do a training on this again on Friday to hemp pan by fix all this. It is again a gray area, like, with dimensional But you're only really supposed to d queue something if... Like, if it's a non Ic, like it's outside of b b Sas, then, like it gets d queued because it's not me to be Saas. If it's b to b status, model dimensional is an issue. Then you should close lost it and then quote the close last reason it's a missing feature. So they like what we should we can walk through that more detail maybe next Friday, and do like, a training around it, but it is it does kind of depend a little bit But for the most part we should only be d something. If, like, we straight up to support of core piece of their technology stack like their Erp, like if know snowflake lake is foundational to their revenue model, Or if it's like a business model, we don't support, but it's not b to b Sas. But other than that, everything else be moving close lost, and we can't have missing features for like, dimensional. Missing features for top sound head account planning like, whatever it is. Or level forecasting would a fall to that category like missing features, even if that is why we lost the deal, we should close payments to Saas, closed last at. Missing features if it's straight up can can't connect to their technology or industry outside the b Saas, then those are really doing times. You should be moving anything in the detail.

Host 1: Well, I think the issue is that there's a lot of Non Saas companies that have a small Saas component. And the reason why they get we can't support them is because they're not saas. But then they have some kind of saas component, but it's like, okay, well, we need our whole business. So it's pulled to, like, the on the qualification guy it says, customers onto to our Ic can still be un if we can't support them. Top line or Op analytics, which is from their non Baby Saas components.

Client 4: Right. Well, mean, I think you kinda just set right there If you're saying, they're not saas, then they're not set like, even if they have a little bit of saas like by designation, they are not saas and you'd consider that disqualified because they're not asked.

Client 2: Yeah. I think with us been a time there's there's more to come here changing a little bit around the publication and vetting a lot up very soon here. So George, let let's chat that. I'm calling you... I'm following on, maybe a speaking super helpful. But yeah. There's any education continue to raise them. I know right times just wanna make sure we go one out of your up to mark. But, yeah. Plenty work come here in list do keep flagging that to Jordan nine will up down the turn. Cool. There's nothing on what's going well or what's going on i'll tracker. Like this because not the the month here. So we'll go ahead and cutting it out. Appreciate you guys. Well done last month. Spring towards the end a year here, and then we probably be a sign half on the christmas with that best ever in the books. So Alerts megs, let me know what you need and good.

Client 2:
