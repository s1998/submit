So we're building right there we're looking into sales tool in Gothic looking into diabetes. And and dialing applications. And they believe I found your name online on g two, and you will talking about the f goal there. So... Yeah, I mean, this is really just us looking to a little more about air and, you know, what you like, but you don't like how you use it and so on and so forth. Perhaps we can kick it up with... Can you tell a little bit more about What do you do and? What does your company do?

Client 3: Yes. So basically, we saw paints well pay and I'm just the customer service support and the said exact to take. So that what we do. So have a this call line it's article call for our calls, customer calls, and etcetera.

Host 1: I'm sorry. I didn't get that. What what does the company you do?

Client 3: Yes. So we we sell paint wallpaper paper. So it's a kinda white product that company office calls, they can apply, you know. It's a solutions for business, So then they can create a new learning space that we what we offer and I'm the one that I'm I'm responsible for the italian market because By italia, but as well for the other market as well.

Host 1: Got it. And so did you say you will leading support there?

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Customer service and sales. Yeah. Basically.

Host 1: Got it. Let me know that's the sales side of things. Well it it's it's quite unusual this is someone who both customer service and sales Well, well, least depends.

Client 3: I mean, it's a small company? Okay. So we are just few people. So that is why we've taken care as well the all the sales part, you know, from the beginning, you know, someone that just contacted for informations and i will go go through the sales sample sales. So... Yes. It's... I mean, uncover different part of the company. So Right.

Host 1: Great. And how big is the company?

Client 3: Well, we are in fifteen. It's very small.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Client 3: But warranty. Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. And tell me more about Air, how did you find out the value in the fill space?

Client 3: Yes. So basically, we we were using another system And then we were to find the just a better solution for us because That's with the order provider that calls were very bad. The line was awful, you know, So that's why we try for one month. And then everybody likes it. So we keep going like that.

Host 1: And what what what was the the previous provider?

Client 3: It was blue phase.

Host 1: Blue fees Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think it's famous I don't have idea, but it was different because I call you know, that you can install in a app or your computer, but the other one where it's stolen... There was a physical phone connect to to internet.

Client 3: I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because before we were in our office, then after the pandemic remove basically at home. So then we're looking a different solution or... Map, most of because the line that we have was was awful. With the blue phase.

Host 1: Right? Yeah. How how is it going? Well what you how what what do you think of vehicle Well, I Have to say that I'm I'm pretty happy.

Client 3: Because it's it's very useful to use and very easy and very friendly, because for example, I used my my phone So I got notifications when I got the call, and I can see who is calling from where and who is taking a call For example, I'm in a team with fu. So somebody took the call, I can see who took the call. You know?? Or if we have any missed course it's easier to see at least an all the voice message through the app. So we don't have to go somewhere else to check the voice message. We just can see from the app, or I can see, for example, if there was me call. I can see if one of my coworkers already called back the customer or not So it's very, very useful. I mean, to have the app or this possible to style as well on the laptop.

Host 1: At mobile, What do you mean? You you you have a way to see if your call your have only reached out Exactly exactly.

Client 3: I don't know how to explain, but basically in this application, we are... I mean, Iv area has an account And when we got a call Okay? You can see, for example, there was a call or it was answered by the name of the agent, so I can see who took the call who come back everything is tracked. I mean, I can see the they try to call or we can as well transfer the nicole So for example, my client call, but not available So my colleague to the call she can transfer to me. So... And everything so is everything there? So I can see how many calls my colleague that are doing during the day, for example, It's just from the history.

Host 1: And is that because you old share the same number. Although you all have your pool number.

Client 3: Well, the things is... Yeah, we have the same number. But actually, we have basically six different number I mean, one from is a german line, one x etcetera. But when we call, we have the yeah. We call from the same number. But we have a different accounts So we can log in with the with different name. But... Yeah, we basically share all these numbers.

Host 1: Got it. That makes sense. Can you tell me a bit more about what do you use that call for?

Client 3: Which tool?

Host 1: What do you... Yeah. What do you use?

Client 3: Yes. So basically for for the for the customers, So if I have to call back a customer or come some company or we use as well internally to cause some my... I mean, my colleagues if they are reply on whatsapp, I will that music to.

Client 3: Yeah. So it's it's mostly for... I mean, for sales calls. Okay. So for customer service.

Host 1: So what kind of things do Customers call you about?

Client 3: Inquire about the products. I don't know. They saw that the the product of it call the the cola asking was this this product was the diminish so basically or all information about what we offer. Or if they looking for applications? Most of them or as well, I don't know, if they need a tracking number of an order that has been placed that they haven't received So so yeah, we we use for for sales customer service calls.

Host 1: I see. Do you Do you ever have, like a question for one of your made about one of the calls they just had. Like, you see that they they picked up foot and it took a zone.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's happened because for example, as for example, I can add the customer to and put the name. Okay. So for example, I know that it's my customer. And I see that my colleague took the call, now we are always you touch so I can ask. And I also from the from from the computer, I can see, for example that calls was... Was about five minutes ten minutes, you know, Yeah.

Client 3: But that's only from the laptop. Because from from the app on the phone, I cannot see how long was the all But it's just for... You know, just if I'm good about if not the main phones box.

Host 1: And when you have a question about a specific call to one of you, one of your c noodles.

Host 1: How do you ask that question? What kind of apple or what kind of medium do you we use...

Client 3: We use Google Google chats.

Host 1: I see.

Host 1: Yeah. What would you think like would it be more convenient if like echo lets you leave internal notes on a given call, like internal comments and questions.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, we have this option actually, but i'm the only one that you it, not sexual interesting.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Now. But there is the option. The only thing now because actually air is connect to z And is there... I say south now software. But it's the one that we use fab call our customers.

Host 1: Right?

Client 3: Yeah. So... Yeah. So if it's super connected. So if I add a notes in this fall, it should be appear on come and he's in his file. But... Yeah, I mean, I'm the one that I always had some notes because, you know, so don't forget it, but No. No. Ma'am my colleagues didn't right. So What what what kind of notes do you add there?

Client 3: So basically, if there are Usually if they ask for a quotation, for example, they say look I want quotation for I don't know three kids of our products. Okay? So, usually, I when they are asking something, you know, if I have to to take some options, so I just add there to don't forget or, you know, it it's easy to see. Or... Yeah. If they're just asking random questions no. But I mean, the the most part things, I added.

Host 1: I see. And So I i I guess my question was was slightly different. My question was we'll like if you wanted to to to leave a comment on a specific goal, He just one at one of your coworkers skills, like, right?

Host 1: Like, at bug, you know, at the, hey, like, what happened during this call away.

Client 3: Yeah. No. I i yeah know this I'm thinking, I don't think this option is possible I... They world that's... No no I don't think there is it this option, I guess. I know I know that they cannot note but I'm not sure if I can tag, but I don't think so.

Host 1: Would it be useful if you could? Like, would you would you stop using Google chat who collaborate a vertical, or would you still use a Google chat whatever the reason?

Client 3: Well, it won't... We won't stop to use Google charts but if we if there was an just add the note and inside look, call this customer back. Okay? And just the note and the way to transfer I mean, this did this calls to to my colleague for... I don't know. Maybe like... Oh, call this guy two hours, and they can have a dashboard with all the notes yeah. I mean it's gonna be helpful. Yeah. Because at the moment we don't have if I if I need something just oh look call you back and then can I put the number.

Host 1: What's your favorite thing about? What you like most it?

Client 3: Oh, Well, I would say that line, the quality is good, And then I I just slide that I can use from my phone. And I don't need to use a physical on phone or. Yeah. My mostly is the quality of the company. The most important things because before there was customer there were complain and say, I cannot hire you. Or the line was broke Right.

Host 1: No. What do it like velvet it?

Client 3: Well these like I i don't know. And I don't know. I'm.

Client 3: I don't know.

Host 1: What would you what would you like them to change about the product?

Client 3: Well, well, It could be any any bug that you would like to see fixed any feature that you would like to see implemented Anything whatsoever about?

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: option soon to record the call and at the moment, I think you have to pay more way more I will like that this option would be in the basic plan.

Host 1: You know you Yeah.

Client 3: No. Because there is the option to I don't know. Maybe it's an important call or you just like to send to your colleague, you know? But now I think you have to pay and have a like training plan to have this option. And I will like that this option will be the basic plan. That don't know if make sense.

Host 1: Yeah. Absolutely. Are you currently on the basic plan? Or like on that more expensive plan.

Client 3: The moment, I think we have... not the basic one like that translation plan.

Client 3: I think there are more plan and we are just on the the professional. I'm not sure about the plan they have because I'm not the one that set up everything.

Host 1: So do you... So you do currently have recording?

Client 3: We have the option, but we cannot... I mean, I can there is the option, but we cannot use it because we have to talk to upgrade the plan. That's thing.

Host 1: I see.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: With all so beyond, like, leaving aside the diet vehicle full minute But all you'll duct problems on the day to day basis and you'll work Okay.

Client 3: You mean during my work with my colleagues and the way any any problem, Like, what what all the the problems that you would look like yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. What's you guys problem.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I I would say yeah. For the customer service. We receive many many emails and calls, sometimes so. Now for the calls, for example, I would say, We have missed calls and there is now the option to see, for example, if there was a miss call who has to call back this customer. Okay? It's it's not mean, maybe I'm gonna back this customer and the customer gonna say, yeah. No. I just received this call, if it was easier to see this this customer was already called back I mean, there is no way to see just checking Better things is I think that air can implement actually.

Client 3: To have the option to just take okay. This customer was already called back. Lexi.

Host 1: Like Just signal of that something like that.

Client 3: Day today, problems trying to complain about my customers. Not much.

Host 1: Okay. Great. I think that's about all the questions I had today. Do you have any other questions Enrique?

Host 2: Yeah. I'm curious you mentioned to use the mobile app Do you also use the desktop apps?

Client 3: I used before bags there was an issue I guess it was connected my because every time I try to chat the call from my laptop the people can cannot hear you or I cannot hear them. Because I guess the settings every time was messed up. And then you made it if you have a meeting at Zoom meeting, and you're gonna see back call from your in your computer, you have to decide or leave immediately the meeting or oh answer up to the customer. So It wasn't a ideal.

Host 2: So you only use your call on your phone now?

Client 3: Yeah. I just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Because really if I have meetings, so if I'm doing something computer and I received the ...I mean, if I cannot take it, I have to close the call... I mean i It's it's easy to.

Host 2: Mh. I think You mentioned earlier, there this feature where You can see who answered a call So Okay.

Host 2: Cool. So Show you the name of your colleague.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can see who took the call who pulled back. Yeah.

Host 2: So for the missed calls then, so Does it show who called back this customer or is that still a problem for you?

Client 3: So basically, as I said, I can see, for example, there was a call. Okay. And then I mean, the... If I click there, I just can see, okay. There was a called to see if there was somebody called this customer i have to scroll up and try to see if this number short up again and somebody has called them, But to If I click just in the call, I cannot see if somebody callback back. Okay.

Client 3: Okay. I I have to go back to the he story check all the calls and see if this number was called back again. But from the missed chart, from sorry, the missed call, I cannot see it. Cool. Makes sense.

Host 2: And those are all the questions for me.

Host 1: I guess my last question is you you mentioned that integrates we you'll see our i'm Z. What other integrations do you use an?

Client 3: Actually, just with this one, I'm thinking. Yeah. Now just just with this one.

Host 1: I see.

Client 3: Yeah. And actually, now I remember, if you if you don't log in on air call in your computer, if you write any notes on on the app. It was synchronous synchronized. So every time every day, you have to connect... Log again on the on the on the laptop on the website, and then it's gonna be synchronized to z. To this. Here I see.

Host 1: Any any other integration that you wish go ahead Well, not really i mean.

Client 3: Maybe from the and I was thinking when we receive an email you know, when there is the the phone number. On Google. I mean, and mean on Google if we have this if we see the phone number on the signature on the mail, if there was the option that we can click and and i call with start. Instead to copy passed on on that. If this makes sense.

Host 1: Yeah. I think I have a chrome extension only they. That let them do that.

Client 3: They they shoot, I guess I didn't I never tried to use a actual.

Host 1: Mh. Alright.

Host 1: Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you so much I also a really appreciate time today.

Client 3: No problem.

Host 1: Alright. You have a great rest of your day.

Client 3: Okay.

Host 1: Thank
