Host 1: Hey, Tom.

Client 2: Hey, Leaandra.

Host 1: How are you? Yeah. How are you?

Client 2: Good. Not too bad for Thursday. The first day of December.

Host 1: Yeah, totally. Weather's been crazy in Austin yesterday was like two days ago, eight degrees, down to 40.

Client 2: Yeah. No, it's just nuts.

Host 1: Yeah. I'm still not used to it. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to handle it, to be honest, but.

Client 2: I prefer the colder weather over the hundred degree heat any day.

Host 1: Cool. Well, it's been a while, so I guess always. Good to just understand where you're at and you had the exact meaning.

Host 1: Yeah. So I'll let you update me.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. So where we are. So I think we're gonna defer this whole kind of looking at project, you know, kind of the planning stuff to key one of next year. I think like, after the planning meeting, we ended up with just a mountain of things we need to do from a planning perspective for 23. And so that's pretty much what we're focused on. And trying to wrap up. The Financial integration. Of you know, the Colorado Company that we bought. So, you know, so that's kind of driving sort of the push. Rather be using a system than Excel to kind of go do all the budgeting and stuff, but yeah, we're just not gonna I don't have the bandwidth right now or the resources to kind of help with that is bread pretty thin.

Client 2: So I think we'll pick it back up in key one and then try to make a push to. Make a decision by the end of the quarter and then, you know, move into implementation in Q two.

Host 1: Okay. That's super helpful. I do want to share this just because I like to. One. I don't want you to think this is a sales tactic. I also don't want it to surprise you with anything. You know, come next year, we literally got this email an hour ago, and we are gonna be changing our pricing in 2023. So just want you to know we're kind of thinking about moving away from the Allyou Can Eat model. Towards like more scubased. Just so not gonna charge per user, but there is still in flux. I actually don't know the details of it, but the pricing structure is likely gonna change.

Host 1: Like the whole goal of it is to help us get higher ACVs out of the customers that are larger and more complex. So. If there is a potential chance, it sounds like there's not that you guys will be able to make a decision within this quarter this month and then implement in any time in next year that you want. We can entertain that. But it sounds like you don't have the time really dedicated to making the decision now. So I did want to just let you know that this is likely going to be something that we have to revisit next year.

Client 2: That's fine. I mean, that's always the risk. Taking too long.

Client 2: There's always that, you know, risk of pricing, the change and all that. So. Yeah. Well, we'll deal with that when it comes.

Host 1: Cool. Okay. Good to know. Awesome. Well, no, I appreciate you jumping on and letting me know the update. Also, you know, just check in with you. I guess in the new Year, do you think January.

Client 2: Yeah. Kind of check in like mid January, because then I'll kind of have a good idea of sort of what schedule looks like. And, you know, couple of couple the key initiatives that will have been done by then.

Host 1: So awesome. Okay.

Client 2: Great.

Host 1: Yeah. We'll just keep in touch. And if anything changes, obviously, my door is always open, but I will check in with you in. I don't know. A month and a half.

Client 2: Sounds good. Trying to keep dragging this out.

Host 1: No worries. I get you guys are doing a lot more high priority things and some of the other people who I'm talking to keep on dragging it out, so I get it.

Host 1: Understood.

Host 1: All right.

Client 2: Thanks, Leaandra.
