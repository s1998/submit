Client 2: Yeah. It's been pretty rainy about We got some snow, like, a couple weeks ago. All and it's kinda stuck a bit, actually, but I guess, today is sort pouring. It's kinda... I'm looking outside kinda all gone actually.

Host 1: Sorry I i turn in Vancouver over a couple of years back. I remember once they're just a little bit of snow, the whole city shut down, like, the buses and everything are most freaking out.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. That's how it is here. First snowfall fall of fast season, it's, like chaos Yeah.

Host 1: I understand. Thanks take the time of your Thursday helping this call. Just for some contacts I'm Enrique Product manager here at sales ai pretty much for the start up where we're building new sales tooling as part of that, we want to learn a little bit more about the dentistry industry. And I think I found your name on g two. I think you were You you wrote up a review about Gong. Does that sound?? Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Cool.

Host 1: So the purpose of this call like to learn a little bit more about you use Gong, your general thoughts about it? And also just learn a little bit more about the context of yourself, just your title, like, your industry, the position and kind of the problems that you face right now in your role. Does sound good Yep. That's sounds sounds good. Maybe you can start off with this a little bit or yourself, Let to learn about company that you work at and what you do there.

Client 2: Yeah. So I'm an an account executive at this company called Spare based son Vancouver So we sell like... Basically, it's. You know, if ever taken an Uber a lyft, it's like selling something like that, but for public transit, the public transit it space. So we sell mainly to government. But we do also sell to, like Uber lyft competitors as well our software. So for ride hailing, Oh that super interesting.

Host 1: And how long have you been at spare?

Client 2: Over two years now. Got it How big is the company now?

Client 2: Fifty fifty plus Yeah.

Host 1: Have you always been working in the eight role? Yeah.

Client 2: I've been in sales for the last civil since, yeah. Since sign graduated basically. So six, seven years Got it And how did we discover Gong?

Host 1: The team always using it when you were first joined?

Client 2: No. The team was not using it. I actually slowly had trial it when I was at Hoo sweet. And yeah Really liked it. So I was working with the Manager at time on different tools, and I... Yeah heard really good things with Gong. ...and have used... I've trial it. So Yeah. Ask them to take a look into it.

Host 1: How long we've been using Gong since then I've been using it since for about a year now.

Host 1: Right fair. And what do you think about it I really like it Yeah.

Client 2: It's it's been it's been like a game changer honestly. Just having at tool like that as a salesperson allows me to like, really focus on the conversation and not like, worry if I'm, like, not taking down notes. You know, properly, so helps me to be like a better active listener and pay attention to what processor test has to say, and, you know, if I forget something or anything I can go back, on their gong recording really easily, and even see, you know, search for, like, keywords and yeah. Share it with, like, the team and make comments and things like So I really like it for that aspect.

Host 1: It so mainly for the lack of note taking have to do. That's the kind of the main value that provides for you It's It's I still take notes after, like, after every call still take notes and log it into sales scores, but what it helps me do is, like, you know, take, like, rough notes maybe at the time and then like, you know, then I can go back to the call recording, and I'm, like, listen to, like, important parts of the call just, like make sure I didn't miss anything and, like, add more detail and then Yeah.

Client 2: Just log my notes Yeah. After watching the recording, Got it.

Host 1: You mentioned there's searching through the transcripts is commenting and sharing snippets of their team. How often are you using each of these three features?

Client 2: The searching for words, I use it a lot, like, you know, looking up things like pricing, you know, what did I say when it came to pricing, you know, sushi up like, keywords, like you know, need or want, you know, if they they like oh, we really like this. Like I'll you know, just go back and, like, ...yeah. Just, like can I remember or write down what they said about, like, what exactly they like if I, like missed this specific detail. So I use that pretty often. Like, sharing it with the team, not as why and, like commenting not as much because it's more for, like, my manager to like, comment on my stuck which like, he doesn't really do that much anyway, but it's just, like you know, if he wants, so you can, like, go in and my comment Yeah like I'm like, hey, you know have a bit of a difficult call. Can he listen to, like know this segment here. You can, like, you can, like, snip it and send it or you can just, like, tag them, like, you know, you just, like, comment a time, and then they can go the entire recording and then go straight and take some straight. So, like that time.

Host 1: Got it. I don't to use that as often?

Client 2: Sorry?

Host 1: you mentioned you don't use that as much.

Client 2: Yeah. I thought as much. No. Like I I mainly use it for, like, my own... Yeah. Sort, like, if I had to have a follow call, I go back to the cloud like, just, you know, see what we talked about last time make sure I didn't like, miss any next steps. And then I use it for Yeah. Like, searching keywords, but in terms of, like, commenting, like, I don't use that much because like I'm not gonna go into, like, know my colleagues call and, like, make random comments, I guess.

Host 1: Got it. That makes sense. Do you go your call calls at all? Like, is there some sort of like Team library, where you're referencing.

Client 2: You can. Yeah. You can You cannot visibility into, like, everybody's calls, but I as a sales and I just don't really but I don't I don't really listen to, like other calls got it.

Host 1: That makes sense. Cool. Is there anything that you don't like about gong?

Client 2: It takes quite a long time. like, if I'm sending... Oh, another thing I do with it is like, I'll send the recording took. Client like prospects. So, especially from doing a demo it's recorded, so I can, like you know, like, section out like, you know, specific parts to the demo or the whole demo and send to them. So I use that like, a lot. And one thing I don't like about it is I find a snippet it part is actually not that great, like, it's just not very user friendly in terms of, like you know, when you, like, snippet it a section of the call, it's, like it it's not really clear like, what part you're like, snip. Thought makes sense. Like the interface like, makes it kind of hard to just, like, play the call, you know, just like, say like, hey, I wanted to start here I wanted to end here. Like, it doesn't... It's just not very intuitive. I always have to, like, go back and make sure, like, did I snippet it the right thing. And then once you snippet it it, it gives you like, a link so that you can, like, you know, hyperlink it in an email setting and when it gets hyperlinks a lot of times it takes, like, over an hour for it to, like, process So if I can't send it right away to like, a prospect, like, I have to wait until it's done, and then I check it and then I send it. So sometimes it sits in my drafts for, like you know, like, a day because, like, you know I... I'm I'm not sending a timer on it. So it's because if I don't do it right away i have to come back to it, so it's like might be sense a little bit later than I would want, but, That's kind of the the downside it's, like, It takes quite a long time to, like, process your calls, I guess.

Host 1: How often are you sending these snippets to your clients and prospects?

Client 2: Probably, like, after every demo. So Yeah. Like... Yeah. Pretty much after every demo. I'll send it.

Host 1: How often are you doing? Does like the whole call recording versus the snippets. Or do you all you see the snippets?

Client 2: I just do the snippet because like, I don't want them to... Or it's just like you know, them hearing like, small talk or things like that like might not be as relevant. So I'll usually just, like, do the snippet once the demo starts.

Host 1: Got it. Makes sense. And what What are you usually making snippets out of? Like, is it specifically Like, certain parts of the discussion what what what are some of the kind topics you're looking to create snippets out of? The demo Just the demo itself.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah.

Host 1: Cool. Because, like, they might wanna go back and, like, rewatch it.

Client 2: And we're, like, share it with their team, like, if they had members that couldn't join. Right, then they they can, like, go in and then watch it.

Host 1: Cool. Have you ever used any other tool similar to Gong or is this your first kind conversation intelligence will used Yeah.

Client 2: This is this is it. I mean, I we use sales loft as well, but that's not. That's not really the same, I guess. Yeah. Yeah Got it.

Host 1: You also have Sdr in your company? Yeah Do you know if they use Gong as well? Or is this mainly yes?

Client 2: They use it for, like... Because they usually take a lot of the intro calls that are lower priority, so they'll they'll use it to record their calls.

Host 1: And those actual, like, phone calls or are they still zoom calls or like, video conferencing calls?

Client 2: It's is length to sales law. So they use sales and then they'll... And then they'll it'll import it automatically into Gong.

Host 1: Got it. So these are sales calls. Yeah. Okay. Cool And do you know if they or maybe you view these calls inside gong or are you actually going into sales loss to references calls?

Client 2: I'll see it in Gong.

Host 1: And what's that typical works workflow like? Are you kind of preparing for a demo and listening to these calls like, what what do you do with this call information?

Client 2: Usually, I don't watch the Sdr calls because they'll take notes from it. But if I want to... like, I could go to, like, my year's call and, like, pull up that call and like, watch it if I wanted to. Got it.

Host 1: What other sales tools are you using? Because I wrong?

Client 2: Sales lost and then Salesforce.

Host 1: Got it And what's your usage of sales like? What are you using for?

Client 2: On the web dial. So I can, like, call people in the Us and well anywhere, like, globally and then Yeah. Like, the it records your calls as well. So Yeah. I just go back to you know, if I had, like, a call where I just, like, phoned up somebody, and I wanted to, like, go back and listen to it then I go onto sales law usually actually. Yeah. I usually just stay a sick and to stick stay in sales law for those kind of, like, thirty second, one minute calls.

Host 1: Got it. And when are you taking these calls Like, when would do use sales loss versus assuming your demo is you use, like, a Zoom or something. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. For for demos, we use Zoom.

Host 1: Yeah. So when would you use sales calls like, what what what's the scenario is they you're using that?

Client 2: If I'm just following up somebody, Like you know, calling somebody on their telephone.

Host 1: Is that for, like, follow ups? Or what what's what do you typically do Okay.

Client 2: Yeah. For, like, follow ups. Yeah.

Host 1: And then with your manager day, often get feedback from your manager via gong or what what what's kind of like that feedback would look like? Is it more during one on ones? How do you get feedback on your calls?

Client 2: Yeah. I not so much. Like, manager doesn't really, like, go in and watch back call unless I like, tell them to or if they're, like, particularly interested in, like, an accounts or something. Like That's kind of That's kinda when. Yeah. They're very... Yeah... I mean, our company in particular, maybe is just we're not very like, we a lot of autonomy, so we don't get, like, micro where i'm you're like goes through and watch like, all of our calls type things it's only, like I ask him to. For some reason Got it.

Host 1: That makes sense. Are there any features that you wish Gong implemented Not really, I just like wish they processed calls faster.

Host 1: Got it. Makes sense Cool. For the rest of this, call, I'd love to show you a little bit about what work working on. I'm gonna share my screen right now. Can you see this?

Client 2: Yes. Okay. Cool. So we're making something pretty similar to gong.

Host 1: This is care towards aes managers initially. So we have your video recording on the left here. You have your transcripts searchable load bottom left. And then we also have this notion of a summary sentiment as well as conversation metrics. So this summary is generated with Ai Well, parts with transcript will look through. What he's after you're talking about wanna give you a nice short summary about what exactly this call consisted of and what was the outcome of that call? And then on the bottom here, you have this sentiment. And we also have these like conversation metrics. Mh. You can take a look at what these things look like, but love to hear your kind of initial thoughts on this idea.

Client 2: I think the summary is cool. That's something they don't do. Yeah. No. At and the same was sentiment, like, they don't do sentiment. And the conversation metrics it kinda is similar I think it's the exact same. Like, yeah, talk time, patients Yeah. But the summary is different for sure.

Host 1: Got it Do you think this summary is useful?

Client 2: Yeah. I think it could be. Yeah. I guess, like it'd be useful if that was probably, like, displayed in the you know, like in the home view where there's, like, maybe a column, like, you know, what is this about? Because it'd be hard to, like, go in then. Like, read the summary. You know, I mean, like it's it's probably better if it's, like displayed in, like, the whole screen, and then if I'm like, scrolling through my Sdr calls, and I can see like, okay, this is well. Like, you know, something important, like, I need to go in there and see. But it's not. On this library, you...

Host 1: You'd love to see some sort of summary around these call?

Client 2: Yeah. I think that would probably be more useful because, like, I mean, for me, like, I'm not going into like my seo calls, you know, like unless like, I get a snapshot and then maybe the summary is like, oh, had difficult conversation on a competitor or whatever than, you know, I I... Like, that would be a call I'd be interested but it's not like I have the time to, like, go into all of this calls and see like, what's this summary about what's this summary about?

Host 1: Got it. That makes sense. And how about your for yourself? Like, would this be useful for you? Just reference a summary of your previous call.

Client 2: Yep. Yeah. I mean, usually I know what the calls are about, but But, yeah. I mean, I I think it'd be... Yeah. Cool To have that there.

Host 1: Yeah You did mention these conversation metrics they are really similar to Gong. Do you actually use the those analytics that gong gives you or do you not find them as useful?

Client 2: Not really. I mean, Yeah. Not really. Got it And then I'm interested a little bit the usability of this sentiment section What do you think this means and like, what would you do if you you're you were using this?

Client 2: The sentiment don't know I've always found the sentiment to be very tricky. I used to have it at sweet, I can't remember. We were using a tool that would tell us like the sentiment of our you know, our tone and everything, but never really found it to be, like super accurate or beneficial, like, Yeah.

Client 2: And i didn't find it, like, that that good. But I don't know. Maybe it's because the the Ai sucked, like, I don't know. Yeah.

Host 1: What would you want? The sentiments section to tell you if anything I mean know, honestly, I don't really like, I don't really I don't really care about sentiment that much.

Client 2: Like unless the... you know... Because there was a terrible call like, I would know. Already. You know So it's started to like... Yeah. It doesn't really tell me something I don't me know, I guess. Got it Yes.

Host 1: Makes a lot of sense. So just looking at this graph, doesn't it make sense what it's trying to convey? Or is it a little of confusing you?

Client 2: I guess, yeah. I guess it's like during certain parts, maybe... It's like it sounds more positive, like, maybe more, like, buying signals perhaps, but it's a negative mean that they got, like, really angry. You know what I I mean like it's like, did it take a turn and then it became, like, really positive? That's Yeah.

Host 1: Good for you. Is it if...

Client 2: Or is it more just, like baseline? Because, like, the red makes it seem like they were like upset. Like, for those two seconds. And then they're were really happy for like, those three seconds ends and then you know what I mean, i was like, not real no conversations really go like that in real life.

Host 1: Yeah. So to you, it's a little confusing exactly? This is trying to convey?

Client 2: Yeah Got it And then We sounded be like an thomas here.

Host 1: Gonna show you another version. Curious what you think about this.

Client 2: Okay. I guess that makes sense like, buying signals. Was negative I don't think we have negative marked up here.

Client 2: Oh, okay.

Host 1: Yeah. Actually see this is play better one there So what...

Client 2: Sorry what I'm looking like that like, the feed... The... Whether the negative is gonna be helpful.

Host 1: Yeah. So just in general this new design Do you know what it's trying to convey?

Host 1: Like, is there still some confusion around this as well.

Client 2: Yeah. I guess that makes sense. But I guess, yeah. So you can Yeah. I can I see what... Yeah. What you're trying convey. Yeah. That makes more sense than the graph.

Host 1: And why do you think it makes more sense in the graph?

Client 2: I guess the graph just the graph makes it seem like it was, like, you know, ups and downs when in reality, like, I mean, I don't know what the negative is like, i... It's like what would be a negative example because the the rest seem like they're positive. That negative seems Actually, I don't know what you guys. Are trying to convey. Sorry. Yeah. Like positive, this so the same sentence, but it's both positive and negative. It's different percentages assigned Oh, yeah.

Host 1: In this example, we we haven't updated this Yeah very confusing. But in theory, these are all. Like, positive things and these would be negative things.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, I just never found like sentiment be that, like, that helpful, Like, I think you know, like, word, like, buying signals like you know, like I don't know. Like, I think it could be, like, if you do keywords, like, I think that would cover a lot of the sentiment... portion. Like love or, like, you know, need or, like, want like, you know, like that. Might cover, but I don't know. Like, I just not... I've just never resonated with, like, having sit. Sentiment to because i I just never found it useful on my previous company. I can't roll it... But what ben was that we're were using, but it was like, off and it was like, didn't really tell me anything. It was just sort of, like there. Got it.

Host 1: I i'll that be feedback. It's it's better to learn from you now than she been in time to create this and shipping it. So I guess, terms of like, the buying signals, You mentioned a few things like keywords like love need want. What else would you want to see here, that would be more useful to here?

Client 2: I think like... Well, I I think already have it down there a conversation metrics like having, like, seeing like, whether they talk like an equal amount, you know, that it shows like that they were engaged. Yeah. I can't think of anything else instead of the sentiment, like, I mean, I think it's more helpful to sentiment thing instead of that graph. Like So I guess maybe you have the graph and then you drill down into it type thing. Bye Yeah. So I thought i'm like, you know, maybe this is you know, better.

Host 1: Maybe just outside of, like, conversation metrics or sentiment, like, pertaining to your meeting video transcript, like, what what's the information that is most important to you you just wanna get a video yourself and and that's it.

Client 2: I think, like, you know, if if there's any follow ups items, like, So to let me know like, if there is something that I need to do, like, you know, if it's like, hey, like, I'll send you... you know, let me get back to you. It's like it's it have like, a section on, like next steps or like, make sure you do this. So action items, like that'd be. That'd be useful. Got it.

Host 1: How useful would it be for things like a topic detection? Let's say we look at your transcript. And we... pinpoint the highlights where you talked about, like, pricing, objections, Yeah Yeah.

Client 2: They do that with gong. Yeah we're not useful.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: And what's wrong did they do that on a per video basis as well. Like, where exactly good they show you that?

Client 2: Yeah. It's like per videos, so go into like you can click that keyword and then initials all the sentences that you mentioned like need or one or whatever and then and then you can click on it and take you straight to like but. Video snippet where you said that sentence.

Host 1: How often do you use that?

Client 2: So pretty often, it's especially if it's price related.

Host 1: Terms of... usefulness specifically your yourself motivate that specific gong feature versus, like, like sentiment analysis, and conversation metrics Her say again So in terms of usefulness is for ourselves, like, how would you rate that?

Host 1: Topic detection, versus a sentiment analysis or, like, conversation metrics feature. Yeah.

Client 2: That's way more important for me.

Host 1: Got it. It's good to know Cool, that was pretty much from my end. Okay. Useful especially right now, as a team where we're in really are early stages of building this product.

Client 2: So cool Feedback is really, really great.

Host 1: Thanks so much for your time. My assistant will be in touch with the gift card But yeah. This Okay.

Client 2: Awesome. Great. Yep. I... Yeah. I hope that he feedback was useful. So Yeah. Great to. Great to meet you.

Host 1: have a great rest of your Thursday. Alright. You too. Bye.

Client 2: But
