Client 4: Oh dear good. Ten third line hello nice meet you.

Host 2: Yeah. What what time is it where you owing so?

Client 4: It's four thirty in the afternoon.

Host 2: Okay. That's good. So that's late. Well, thanks a ton taking the time really appreciate. So the context contextual for this conversation is will the team of at tim floor and we're working on a sales student. So what we're building a few applications for salespeople and the one that we're looking into is dial. And so this is basically us looking to learn at the market and and, you know, what people like, what it is like you and on and forth. So just very open ended indeed kind of conversation. Yeah. I I believe I found your name on g two. I think you were talking about vehicle. So yeah, just generally a to heal about experience with the apple. Perhaps we can kick it up, please... Can you tell us a little bit more about you? Again what what do you do do.

Client 4: I myself, you may have seen I work for any insightful, it's a productivity and workforce analytics plant form. We provide our clients with insights and visibility into how and please spend their workday on words whether they're productive or not, what is the amount of productivity where the bottlenecks in productivity and how sample can help with improving on those. I'm a myself work as an enterprise account executive.

Host 2: Got it. What kind of employee? Gonna Very very good question.

Client 4: We're talking about any type of activity that can happen on employees computers. Nowadays when many are working remotely or in hybrid, very often employer does have in enough insights sign to which program simple is use, whether they use them in the right way whether they're spending too much time away from a computer and what is it that may be pulling employees away from a computer, that is exactly where inside full can assist and it's very user friendly the solution that doesn't even require spending too much timing to analyzing that data. A lot of data is already, let's say digestive ready to use and to pretty much we tend to deliver a lot of different kinds of actionable insights.

Host 2: Got it. And having is the company and how is your team there?

Client 4: Our company counts around eighty employees. The majority of employees are here and some of the employees are in the United States.

Host 2: Got it. And how how how big is is your team up of of Sales?

Client 4: Eighteen or nineteen employees right now, ranging from lead gen team all the way up to team leadership.

Host 2: That makes sense. And so do you do you get your leaves? Like, do you do you generate your own or order does someone give you leads?

Client 4: Well, marketing, I have to say is doing a tremendously good job. So we do rely on marketing a lot. We have some credible professionals that are very good at their job did do deal with different kind of campaigns and depending on the region or what to weave from the sales are recognizing as a potential, we're suggesting the markets or industries that could be beneficial. But in that sense, we are getting a lot of leads from the inbound communication depending on what what are the companies that may have visited our web side or left any of the information on the websites, but we also have an outbound heels team that does a very good job target ideal customer profile companies.

Host 2: That makes sense. And how how did you find out about F gold in the field place Well, we have to look for a solution that's gonna help us let's say autumn itemized a lot of things and automate how we're gonna be connecting different programs that we're working with where we can see different data from one program to another and that is where pretty much it was very easy to...

Client 4: Let's say focus on air call because first of all, it's very very nicely integrated with the old solution instead we use internally. A lot of things are automated So there is not too much work to do in order to make it work. It's very convenient to use it on the go if you have to, let's say get away from the computer, but still be available So that actually helped us shortlist the solution very very easily. And we have been using it for more than two years now.

Host 2: And do you remember what other solutions you looked into?

Client 4: We have been and not remember every one of those we were as we're using cup spot is the internal Crm, we have contacted them first for an built solution right there, but because we're... We're using different program simply wasn't good enough to cover all our needs. I think we were also looking into talk desk ring. I'm not sure whether there was anything else. But right now, for example, besides the air call, because we also rely on sales we're using their integrated dial as well.

Host 2: Sounds left.

Client 4: Yes.

Host 2: Yes. So you use both Sales left and and and apple That is correct.

Client 4: Part of the team relies on the sales side sales loft. Not the whole sales team relies on it. But those who do, they switched from air call to to sales.

Host 2: Why?

Client 4: Because of the... How sales is organized, Because what they offer in their plan, it was more reasonable for us to go with the sales integrated solution.

Host 2: Like what go ahead.

Client 4: As simply the flow because the the out found Sd sdr, they have to go through a lot of coals, a lot of companies and leads and simply the flow is a little bit easier in the sense that if you're gonna spare five or ten seconds per call maybe even more from switching from one tab to another you're gonna save a lot more throughout a day not to talk about a month or a quarter. So in that sense, it's way more reasonable to rely on it. But the majority of the team still relies on air call exclusively.

Host 2: No. That makes sense. You mentioned mentioned the hot wasn't good enough what what was wrong with it?

Client 4: It wasn't that anything was wrong but because we are using different solutions throughout our platforms and how fast it is and reliable we decided to go with air call.

Client 4: Because some of the we have discovered some of the limitations and bugs I cannot tell you exactly what was so so annoying about it, but the air seemed a more reasonable solution. And now because of being perfectly integrated with Gong that we use with the hubspot that I mentioned. Then that flow is simply very, very difficult to say no to. Let's say.

Host 2: I got it. So was it was it that, like, hap hubspot wasn't as well integrated and and was Buggy. Was that is that is that a follow?

Client 4: Yeah. That's correct. That is correct.

Host 2: What what what what what kind of integrations do you need?

Client 4: Well, right now, we are heavily relying on the integration with with Gong we are relying on... I know that marketing maybe be used using it occasionally. Let me double check then, yes, the necessity to be available on the smartphone as well, way more convenient to use it to, then one fantastic advantage of of air call is that when you're using it with your smart devices, you also notified. Depending on how you use different solutions. For example, if are using the smart and watch or something you are gonna be having your smart the large ring as well with the air call application installed on the smartphone. So in that sense, we're talking about a lot of those little things that are making availability much much easier with air call present.

Host 2: That make sense. What what are favorite things about dental?

Client 4: For me favorite things are the fact that rings on my smartphone as well. Very easy to set it up when they we talk about the availability. Very easy to go to the recordings. Very nice interface when looking and going through those recordings, very easy to to identify or let's say walk through your call if you need to listen to it very easy to filter throughout the application The setup process is very easy. Another a fantastic thing is that the add on for Chrome will recognize phone phone numbers in a lot of different websites So it's very easy to pull up a dial as soon as you click on the number, very, very convenient and and sometimes saving. You can even do that and it's gonna recognize phone numbers within hop spot and make it easier to make a focal. So you sometimes and very often actually You don't even have to go through the suggested workflow then hubspot has which is make a call, and then you choose a number But on multiple parts of the screen, you're gonna see a phone number of prospect you're looking to call and you're gonna pull up a dial. In that sense, how how intuitively reacts to user commands, it's very into user's flow. Is very very convenient. If you need to make a call from the phone, also convenient as well. You have a very nice looking dial you don't have to run around spot. If you do have numbers, you can just simply dive and dial them from from the smartphone too. One thing for example that I don't like, is that you need to Let's say It's not as intuitive if you want to look for a phone number that you dialed from within the program. Of course, the Pentagon the team you're not gonna run through air call at all in order to look for phone numbers, but sometimes you may have to on intuitive, but that is just need the haystack if if I specifically have to find something that I don't like. This sport is fantastic. They will stay on tampa order to to resolve any of the challenges you may have encountered and make sure that but they assist you as soon as possible.

Host 1: Was air called, the only product that you looked at that had a mobile app That one that one was the one that we looked into the most.

Client 4: Because also due to the team size back then two and so years ago, we didn't even gonna have too much bandwidth in order to thoroughly analyze multiple solutions. Or test it out.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Host 2: You you mentioned support how often and the you reached to called support.

Client 4: Luckily, not too often, I would say maybe once a quarter even when I think about team team challenges I would say approximately once a quarter, it may be say note to try to to understand whether the challenge was due you connectivity shoes of some of the team members or it was an air call each to, let's say once once a quarter.

Host 3: That that chrome extension that you mentioned how often are you using that? What did you use it for?

Client 4: What's great is that with the Chrome extension, all you need to do is to log in and it's gonna help with identifying phone numbers on the page. So you don't have to interact with it too often. What happens occasionally, which is a little bit annoying, but not too annoying. It's that. Logs you out. It's it may be a security or of a or privacy let's say action, but you do have to re login into and it's gonna it's simply gonna help you with the flow. So for example, if you don't have an active, you will have to go through the for example, Hubspot suggested flow call and then choose a number. But if you do have the add on, and it's recognizing the phone numbers you can immediately call the dial or from by clicking the the number itself. So very, very convenient in that sense. Very good. And I do have to say have in mind that I that I did change companies So far, air call is the best solution that I have that I have used so far. Now if you... If you ask me right away, Which solutions we have been using, We have been using z dial before We have been using the Hubspot not in this company, but in some of the previous companies I've been with. And so far the most the most intuitive end user friendly air seems to be the one.

Host 2: You mentioned recording. Does automatically record all your meetings.

Client 4: It does. It does. All the... Basically all the phone calls. Yes. Automatically recorded, you can look for those recordings throughout the program itself, because of our integration with Gong within Gong itself, we can listen to the recordings too. So very, very convenient in that sense as well.

Host 2: And how does it work like? Does it does it warm as the person that you're talking? That the call is being recorded?

Client 4: It doesn't. No.

Host 2: Interesting.

Client 4: On the other hand, for example, when we're having live meetings or let's say Google meet something, then we're using Gong that notify that the meeting is recorded.

Host 2: What do you use the recordings for?

Client 4: Are we talking about phone rig porting phone call recordings or the meeting recordings.

Host 2: Either Well, we do use them When we talk about the meeting recordings, we use them for sharing them with clients in order for them to have access to everything we have discussed because very often in now were demos we talk extensively about multiple features of our own solution.

Client 4: And sometimes they do return it if it is you know, a feature walk through specifically they will return to it in order to music as a as the source of knowledge. The other way we use all those recordings is Very easy for note taking. During a meeting, you don't have to lose focus from a conversation, but you can take the dig the notes later The gong, for example is so fantastic that it's gonna do transcription of older the conversations, it can do the surge. Buy a keyword. So it's very, very good. Solution for training and improvement opportunity for each individual person has their meetings recorded. Same thing goes for for air call. We have inbound and outbound sdr that their main job is to focus on booking meetings. And sometimes, they may miss here a certain information and they ask for help. So listening to the recording will be very, very meaningful rather than bothering someone to repeat a certain an email or a phone number or anything that may sound maybe muffled, you know, in instead of asking them to repeat five times, you will just say, hey, okay, but then someone's can ask you or someone else, Hey, can you please listen to the recording? I'm not sure what the email address is.

Client 4: That still doesn't happen too often, but it is very important then again, of course, for for those purposes of verifying data. Another great thing, where we use the the phone call rate recordings is to make sure that both inbound and outbound Sdr are doing exactly where they're supposed in the sense of using specific keywords depending on the type of testing that they're conducting in a sense of a campaign. Specific keywords or specific topics that are going to push our prospects in to booking a meeting, or in order to make sure that Simply they're doing their job well. So predominantly leads the training purposes in those video recordings for sharing them with clients in training purposes as well.

Host 2: What's the difference between ethical gold recordings and gong recordings?

Client 4: Well, we do we do use air call for for phone call recording only. One other segment that I haven't mentioned so far, I'm not even sure why is that with the Us market, air call is a very good solution when it comes to text messaging. Very convenient. Text messaging is a great add on for an additional nudge towards prospects who may be unresponsive So very, very good feature there as well. And we when we talk about the Gong, it's gonna help you you know, For instance, I'm not even sure. I i don't... I don't assume that air call can record Google Meet ko or anything similar. But the gong is way more complex in the sense of providing suggestions different types of Ai that can help you with suggesting follow ups calls. It's gonna pull out notes where exactly you mentioned you will follow up on a specific topic and it's gonna remind you about that. So in that sense, fantastic solution. And also, it does store data for a very long time. So if you need to go over certain recordings from a year or two years ago, you can easily pull those back up. In order to talk about improvement in quality quality assurance training purposes for for new team members. So a lot a lot of opportunities where Gong seems to be a very, very helpful solution and frankly speaking, we even thought about Ditching Gong not longer ago due to pricing But we realized that it's not that easy to let Gong go.

Host 2: Why not because simply we we revisited the idea and revise that in a sense of what we're gonna lose if we stop using if we stop using Gong and simply simply the the negatives were so much bigger then deposited in case we canceled it, so we decided to stick with it no matter how how expensive it is.

Host 2: What would you lose if you can sort to Gong?

Client 4: The opportunity to track quality of the meetings of the we've a very very thorough a Qa approach to each account executive. And in that sense, a lot of calls are no matter how long is someone with the company, we will continuously look for opportunities to improve our phone calls. No matter how how many quarters you reach for target, not just individually, but the team wise we're continuously looking for ways to to improve quality of those calls in the trans transcript of the conversation and the notes and how easy it is to follow and and analyze keywords is fantastic. Another great thing about the gong specifically is that it's gonna score the conversation between two people, it was one side or not, interactivity what they call it, It's gonna show exactly the suggested range of a ratio, how much he's be compared to the customer. It's gonna tell you how long the customer story is where the areas of of improvement are it's gonna suggest timeline, when to chase them and not to let them cool off a very, very good solution I have to say.

Host 2: Yeah. Do you have a sense of how much you're spending for com?

Client 4: I don't. But if you want, I can check that for you. I think I should be able to get better of information.

Host 2: I would love that. If you were able to follow up and I'm be curious. If that's okay. But sure.

Client 4: No worries.

Host 2: Thank you. Tell more... I I realized drastic. Can you use air like? What do you use it for?

Client 4: For example, account executives will use Gong to follow up with clients to answer the calls because we don't have teams utterance sales being sponsored on those inbound calls. So it's for outbound reach towards prospects you're are all already speaking with. To connect with them if necessary, to receive inbound calls to as I mentioned until recently outbound team was using air call for reaching out to the outbound potential appliance. Now they switched to sales. And inbound Sc sdr, they still need to reach out to those who have left their data on our website for the for the purpose of booking demo and introduction call. And as I mentioned yet, that is approximately seventeen eight team team members and out of those seventeen eighteen. Let me tell you how many use air call I would say that is around ten to twelve people. And he is air called pretty much The majority of those ten twelve every day.

Host 2: And do you have a sense of how much you pay full alcohol?

Client 4: I don't know exactly because we may have renewed that that is something that our sales... Sales manager took up on him. But I can check that as well. For air call and the Gong. Having get my debt. I've been with the company for quite some time that should be in easy information to get Great.

Host 2: So separately from air and Gong and of that's stuff like, generally speaking, what are your top problems right now at work?

Client 4: Problems. If you ask me specifically, I would say there are no problems.

Host 2: Oh wow. Lucky name.

Client 4: No. I... You know, one one interesting thing that I just discussed with the the sales manager today is that this particular order seems the most dynamic ever since I joined the company, which is very interesting because the pandemic is is cooling off and we we have seen a huge break the pandemic started. But what would be the the major problems are we talking about the usability of the problems? Or are we talking about the general problems that the company may be dealing with or we think we may be dealing with.

Host 2: Either.

Client 4: So in the sense of a software solution, software solutions that we may be using. I would say that so far This has been the most organized sales steam that I have ever been part off. In the sense of every role has their responsibility, there are no expectations for one person to mix and match three roles in one, which we see a lot happening especially with startups. But when we talk about the problems in ten bead that may you know, some team members may not be pulling as some as hard as some others, but that is very, very easy to recognize Another thing is that you know, sometimes marketing campaigns may happen to be a miss and for those team members who are focusing on monthly targets, that can easily slip as as a month when we talk about targets. Overall. Company wise, you know, it may be the fact that we have seen a huge increase in demand when the pandemic started because a lot of companies can move towards working from home, so they wanted to track employee productivity as soon as possible. Now that the pandemic is says pretty much over. You know, it's difficult to to understand what could be another wave that we can write But luckily, as I mentioned, this quarter seems to be the the most active one ever since. So I guess, not not not a bad situation we're in right now at all.

Host 2: You. I'm sorry. You mentioned what problem still, like, perhaps some in build that because how some others deals they did missed Yeah.

Client 4: That could be that is not software related.

Client 4: We're talking about you know, the the the talent acquisition challenges that may happening, but, you know, with smaller companies that is very easy to uncover and deal with if if necessary.

Host 2: Great. Awesome.

Host 2: Perfect. Alright. Well, I have no other questions. Very exactly any less questions.

Host 1: So far, so good.

Host 2: Alright. Awesome. Well, thank you so much dry. You have. You have a great rest of your day Where you sheet time today.

Client 4: Absolute pleasure. Thank you so much and enjoy the rest of the day, gentlemen.

Host 2: Absolutely totally see you.
