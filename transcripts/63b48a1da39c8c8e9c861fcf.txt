Client 2: Lee, how's it going?

Host 1: Hey, Rabindranath. Yeah. It's good. And you?

Client 2: Yeah. Good. You have get Christmas.

Host 1: Yeah. It was great. It's good weekend. And how about yourself?

Client 2: Yep. Well again. Not fun.

Host 1: Back kinda back kinda of Tuesday already. Seems like it just came with as quick as it came.

Client 2: Yeah. Oh okay.

Host 1: Yep.

Client 2: So taking a look at this, list that decent sent. So it's fifty five hundred dollars.

Client 2: Basically, in, like, that's is, you know, per person we can do three matches around or whatever a month?

Host 1: Yep. That's right. So five is yeah. The most basic package. You kind of you get everything with that that you wouldn't need other tiers The only thing you're getting with the other chairs is just more, more engagements, more things that we can knew with through data you get into group matching. But yeah, you you get through matching rounds, branding, you know, everything you would get with our our Cs team w with to matching.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I think And we're trying to do kind of that basic features, you know, again, like, more like jon chat Tobias thing.

Client 2: Yeah. Book. So you know, I think definitely for us, the basics makes the most sense we'll probably have a very simple dialogue with people, you know, compared to some of the other folks I think especially the beginning, our goal is gonna be kinda keep it. Simple. We might do some other things maybe later with more specific topics, but I think for now our goal to just kinda like, do basic connections and do an automated way like this. Yeah. So we'd probably be looking at... like, I guess I looked at, like, you know, the the overview deck and all that, which just like just keeping it really simple. You know, as far as like you think it still work for us. Right? If we were just trying to to keep it a really basic like that. Like, so I'm interested in discussing topics, it's like mean we might I don't even know like, we may not even make need that.

Client 2: Like I'm interested in having a discussion with the A ever said of i team mike because like hard like employer. If they give it still work. You don't see any issues with you know, using this platform of that. Right?

Host 1: No. So our basic plan is is the best possible option to get started. We we would do one to ones so we can always grow from there as you wanna get more accomplished likes in the platform allows that. So automating at scale, you know, you want people in the organization to have a really easy way get to know others build connections we can get this solution like in place really quickly. Within a couple of weeks that's in January start ramping this up there, it's searching doing a lot of different things with that your parent company is using you've used it before you know there's value. I think the biggest thing is... Yeah. Or seems gonna help you set this whole thing up. Much more robust than than Doing. So I think you the results that you're not gonna see with with donut. Plus using Ms teams we can kind of do it in any way that you want to. And and go from there, but I I think this is actually a pretty nice fit. Seen that you, you know, you have over hundred plus employees kind of the ideal place for us to get started with this basic package.

Client 2: So if we did... So we're trying to use our budget from this year And because we have a little leftover money in the bank there but also, it's like... But so get the most out of our services with you guys, like is there a way for us to, like, you know, have our don't know. Contract date, like you know the t thirty or something like that, but then, like, you know, knowing that, like, hey we're not even gonna have our first discussion about this until you know, for another week or something. Don't know how that would work through like Yeah.

Client 2: As far as I don't know. Like, on the books two lines to be like, i hey, we purchased this, you know, this quarter for budget purposes and then but then actually having our you know, this rolling this out in the next in few weeks or whatever all that makes sense. Because I don't know people... People usually buy stuff then they're like, okay. Let's like, we wait a couple months, you know? Or something where it's effective or around don't know how it usually works from first start.

Host 1: Yep. So there are some things that we can do. One you know, your budget for the end of year closes on the t on Friday. That that's what it sounds like Right? Okay. Number two, as as a tool you're wanting to get this in before that budget closes that five k basic plan. Would that be the plan here?

Client 2: Yep.

Host 1: So what we can do is yeah. The agreement that I send over is is has everything that's included in that, that five k tier is there anyone else let's say we would get sign off by the t and start at a date that you'd want to sometime of January. Would would you be the one to sign off on that? Or there be anyone else that we need to loop in the conversation?

Client 2: I may have... I don't know if I'll be able to sign or my boss, but I've already had a conversation with her about it. She's you know, it's a green light if I wanna do it. So So, yeah, I mean, she might be one of the signature, but do have question can we pay with the credit card? Or... Because that Yeah.

Host 1: Can. Okay. Yeah. What I can do list her because she doesn't have a limit or it's a really high limit on hers.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. What we can do is I can send you an official agreement if there's from that Yep.

Host 1: Doc that I sent you. I'll just send it to like a dropbox sign and what I'll do is i'll either include you it, but I can also include the sign I can and it directly to them for for sign off.

Client 2: Can put it jackie nine or what do you guys have?

Host 1: It it's dropbox. I used to be hello sign, but it was bought up by dropbox sign. It's pretty much like a to sign, but I can send that today, let's say at that two level. And if you all want sign off and and get this within budget this week, What date... I can set the the date that we'd actually start the agreement so it'd be twelve months from the day it could be January fifteenth, it could be whatever date that you want. And then we can go from there.

Client 2: Trying to think of, like, the effective needs to be this year though. For it to come out. I think i if we're purchasing it. Like, does it have like purchase date or something like that? Is like trying to think of like can just make sure this comes out of this series but So me see or agreement date what would you need for it?

Client 2: I mean, what we have we have is a contract signed date, and then we have an effective date.

Host 1: But, you know, whatever you would need on your end. Works for... I guess, on our end, it probably urine as long as you sign the agreement Let's say, this week.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: You would.

Client 2: We could do that. Okay. Let's do that and then let's feel like contract start the you know, It's fine. We'll this... We'll just keep the contract started date at the same okay. Sounds like we're not working on send first or whatever, but yeah I won't I mean, Don't know. Does it matter if it's like January third, or January first but your end are what is it?

Host 1: It doesn't... It doesn't make a difference. So, you know, let's let's save the weekend at least, if you wanna start this on, you know, the first or Monday, the second Like i said seconds.

Client 2: So let's do the third, I guess. Okay. Okay. Cool. Go ahead and write it up. I'll give you my do I need to give you the names on here as well?

Host 1: If you have the name the email, that would be good. I can add to it.

Client 2: Yep. Hold on one second. Let just sure goes Okay. So it's Julia Last name is s p o n s l e I'm sorry. S p o n s e l l e r And her email address is jay, and then her last name, which I'll spell on their time. It's j spun seller miller.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. So it's j s p o n s e l l E r had tri stat ventures. Just like mine k.

Host 1: Perfect.

Host 1: And shipped that that should be all needs If you need a title, it's the Sv p of people and culture, Perfect.

Host 1: If so if I send that over... And when I send it I'll include unit of course it you can you know when it sends over Yeah.

Host 1: Any idea, I guess, it's already at a chat with their you're all getting this edition in the budget. Is that like a a a day thing? Or or what is your time look like, looking like just so I on my end and I can chat with my leadership.

Client 2: It would be today tomorrow or Thursday, I'm not a hundred percent sure when she'll sign it, but I have another meeting with her on Thursday. So Absolutely. This would be Thursday.

Client 2: Okay. So Yeah. So it should be should be good for coming forward with this.

Host 1: So Okay. Just on the doughnut thing, one everything that you would have with Donut in and a tons more. So there's a lot more that we can do with this.

Host 1: Any any questions on your end or or thoughts in general before, you know, hundred percent confident moving forward with this agreement.

Client 2: I mean, for us, it was just like will this be sort of like we wanted to be really simple low barrier way for people to disconnect Right? And so I just don't want it to be So cumbersome the amount of steps they have to do to connect So I wanna keep that really basic and simple. Honestly, like which is probably really... I know that's probably an attractive feature for your product. But, like, for us right now, like, we just wanna get people started doing this and, like, not put a lot of, like... Oh, there's too much stuff to fill out or you know, something like that where they're like not doing it, and we don't need right now. We're not setting up like, really specific dialogue in conversations. It's gonna be like you know, get to know this other person who works in our organization, we're trying to, you know, can I, you know, like to said, like the Donut theme type type of products so that was our goal.

Client 2: As long as we can we can do that. And I have a lot of barriers there, like, I think that would be really good for us. So I think honestly, I think we'll be really like, easy customers are you all because like We're just like running, you know, that that piece. And and, like, we... You know, their pieces like, well wanna know how many people connected and things like that, but, like, you know, like we don't need it a kind of a ton of that right now. We may... You know, maybe maybe we wanna spice it up six months into this something and, like, say like, hey we wanna have, like, more dialogue and let's we're gonna change it so that like, we're gonna talk about, you know, more specific topics. But like, right now that's not our goal our goals connect people people have never talked with other people work within the organization and we're all of country now and, you know, two years ago, everyone worked on the same office. It's very different environment now. So just back people and and build, you know, basic relationships. Through a product like this. So we can keep it very simple.

Host 1: And it... It's a simple product anyway. And the what we're asking from and you gone this. So you know, like, the opt in the sign form it's very quick and easy. Just meeting up with people even from the admin perspective and setting this whole thing up, can keep it really basic, You know, not a lot of time for you. Hopefully, we're gonna give you a lot of time back making these connections, you're always gonna have someone our team as like, an account manager with you. So Yeah. Hopefully, this is seamless, you know, you're gonna get a lot of raving testimonials from your employees on these conversations. That that's our biggest thing. And a lot of feedback. So I I think, you know, there's a really strong fit year in potential for this to grow really well. So I'm I'm completely with you on that.

Client 2: Okay. Awesome. Alright. Yeah. Let's go for it.

Host 1: Alright. I'll get this over to you today and then... yeah. You know, even during your conversation, just let me know if anything else Yep. If you need else on the front.

Client 2: Okay. I probably probably won't. So Okay.

Client 2: Cool. Awesome.

Host 1: Yep. Is you right. Then soon hopefully enjoy the rest of the the in between, we can tell the next year on it.

Client 2: Yep. Sounds good. Alright.

Host 1: Thanks. Alright. Talk soon.
