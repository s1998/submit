Client 3: Good.

Host 1: Good. How is this one?

Client 3: It's the world cup, like the Us Nice.

Host 1: I'm not following. Soccer like the one sport that I'm following it.

Client 2: I lost watched the game richard I promise. Little I watched it while I work because it was middle a day for us, but I guess i'm say it's on a recorded line, which is probably the smartest thing I've ever done, but Yeah. We, you know, manage this skull score at least a goal and group play, so that was development for us. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. I'll tell you least. I I've been lucky enough to work. Out of the world. Through Latin America and Asia and It really is the well guide. And just knowing you know, for the times I've been in in sales, just knowing a little bit, once gal got in football, I'd tell you, it it just gets the other person. Talking very passionately. So just this incredible. So Well, that's enough motivation for me to start watching tomorrow.

Host 1: So Richard i'll I'll keep you on tabs on what I see.

Client 3: Yeah. Well, if if if if two miracles happen, Us netherlands, which would be a minor a miracle and Australia argentina data, which would be a major miracle We would then made in the quarter So gloves then the gloves would be off Nice.

Host 1: Yeah. The one thing that I do know is that Latin America does love soccer. So they're very good at it.

Client 3: And and and I I mean, I just fully dialed into it now. I mean today, the Japanese just beats spain after beating Germany.

Client 2: Oh wow. Mean what it's now explaining that.

Client 3: I mean So the the blue just they're there on fire, so you can imagine the whole of yeah, at the whole of Japan. Behind and same satellites. It's It's great. You know, The world's What a pretty pretty nasty place the last sort of six months so. Think this is a bit of is a bit of a bit of positivity in It a bit better something to focus on?

Host 1: Yeah. I love japanese let lose little. So that'd be interesting in.

Client 3: I really play really exciting.

Client 3: Right? Teamwork work very Yeah. They really... Like their passions out on the soccer field. It's... Yeah, it's terrific. So Went against Germany and Spain that's That's wild.

Client 3: how do you do that?

Client 2: You guys doesn't know how. So I I can't answer but damage to packing their bags and going back to Germany.

Client 3: I mean, there'll be a I mean, i just just can't happen.

Client 2: And that's wild happen.

Client 3: So anyway Anyway might meeting with Well yesterday today. Been left been left with Me, the you know, the board. Realize this coming into the next phase of hopefully, where we... Where we grow into and now level of sophistication that this is perfect. I mean you know, right... Right. So. Mean. I'm a team of one, it's it's entirely my ability to choose a product. Implemented well. And ensure that it it really is that It's the it's the driving wheel. For management information. I mean, if thought I do it well, then it becomes a disaster. If I do it really well, it becomes just one of the core platforms that we use in our business like we use. Our sales side. Well like we use it that. On our delivery side, etcetera. So it's as you know, it's as simple as that. And They save of one. That's good. Because there's there's it entirely falls on on my shoulders. Obviously, being it same with one. Same time I've gotta make sure I get it right.

Client 3: So thinking about... So, So I still got stop similar the two that I'm sort the signing on but I will I will choose something and I will choose something. And I will something in December.

Host 1: Okay So that's that's good for me from your side.

Client 3: I really do want one reference to talk to on how how it's been implemented. It really getting my head around you, how How much of it how much of an effort is is it for me once implemented to Right. This is another financial system.

Client 3: And it's that's step focus Yeah I'm gonna get a lot of better information. Gonna be able to trust it more and I'm not gonna spend so much time on break fix, which I do with my current models. But really, you know, how how how efficient is it? You know, obviously outside of hump that you get get across how efficient it is this is part of my my tools. And you know, I'd like to talk to of your australian customers. It could to sort of discuss that as I said I've done that the calls and so. And then on the on the other person thinking about the pricing. And I think there's a win win. I mean, appreciate where you've got down to on price. Probably need a little bit more but I was thinking If this is successful, we're gonna we're gonna continue to roll forward. Right? I mean, it's impossible.

Host 1: Only get it more as you grow.

Client 3: Possible too, is it possible for me to have a successful implementation? Successfully is this is our management information product. An say. I'm I'm I'm gonna change. This just not gonna happen. Now, That might happen. A five year time frame. But to really go through that whole thing again, with all the things that are happening this is that would be such a long just Gestation period so even start to think about it let alone. Where do you ever would, because hopefully, your product continues to develop. And it just just supports our business. So would be no reason to. So Think god. Implementation period where It's sort of not really operating it's big. Implemented. I've got a an issue our where. Currencies made in a historic low albeit it's improving. It's going out quickly going up about ten to percent. You know, as soon as you your your fed starts to talk about not rising interest rates. It's pretty in. You know, people... Sorry. And the sixty cents for the australian dollar is historically. Poor. It sort of levels out about seventy to seventy five. And then hopefully in the next twelve months so I'm gonna start to get to Us still his team. So. Few contracts. We've got once.

Client 3: Well... Yeah. Hopefully I mean where like, you we wanna sell it to privacy markets because we can. Yep in the product. Product i can can do that. So that'll i'll give you that'll would give you a bit of a hitch. So know, I think I think it would go. On we'll start with the one year because I you know, I'm setting myself up to too much aggravation going for more than year. Having approved. How the product is. I think an extra month. For that first year like four eight months. I think that gives me lower annual cost upfront? Which helps offset some of those things that I've spoken about The day hit. I mean, you you just got a short thing if it's implemented well. Right? So you get you get to go back to the sticker approach you're happy with ongoing. So I think to make I always try to think about these things as a win. To me that's probably the sensible landing point.

Host 1: Okay. So, no. That was of really helpful context. And part of what you said, I do wanna address as far as, like, implementation talking to someone, like, totally fine. We can definitely find someone for you speak with. I think our next step aside from, like, coming to a terms on price and everything like that, because even if we have you talk to someone, your business is different from theirs, I spoke with our data team about, like, use your companies specifically and would love just get on a scoping call and make sure that in the non saas part of the business, we understand how i bring that data into the tool, And they'll actually be able to give you a really accurate timeline as far as what your implementation time one will look like.

Host 1: So Actually, it's. I was thinking the timing, but both of our data people are in like, of them in Bermuda, another one is in Colorado.

Client 3: So well. Good meter. That's interesting place to be right out.

Host 1: Totally, he moved he's from Georgia. I guess his wife is from Bermuda and he doesn't no sam's right.

Host 1: It was... Sorry. Was that?

Client 3: It's he's not one of Sam's Mates.

Client 3: Yeah f x.

Host 1: The same No.

Host 1: No. No no Definitely This guy is buttoned up you'll see here he chose up to always his call a student tie.

Host 1: Yeah. It's pretty it's pretty funny...

Client 2: Think buddies. Yeah. I don't think I save bet.

Host 1: Yeah. So I do wanna hear the scoping call and just because time zones are a little bit tough all we'll work on your schedule because they normally have, like, time set up, but Well, Denisha, I will help together and find an australian customer for you to speak with. As well. So that's like my next lapses is scoping call, reference call a lot australians, you know, australians are very open and honest And so I I I I don't see you have a problem with one of your customers saying I'll have chat five to two minutes.

Client 3: I mean, I think it's just It's how we... It's how... It's how we do things down here. It's not unusual whole as i said, you know, you know, just how i've thought about the pricing. I mean, we we do come from a minute perspective, and I was really sitting thinking about your side on my side and how we could make it's just how we and we right, But, you know, we're could obviously good we're good customers in, you know I think your I mean your product looks six here. Sorry. I mean, I think in terms of presenting the various options to the board, you know, like that come from come from different places, but I didn't... it just just looks a bit looks a bit nice that People like that.

Host 1: Like also I would say easier just because it is so intuitive and But that's so...

Client 3: Yeah. Look that's that's a concept.

Client 3: True. I'm not. I'm not saying it's not but, you know, that's that That's the big unknown. Right? And and your product is still only as good as my ability to get my head out. Like, if I can't... If I can't me that, from whatever reason it, Right that the contact concept doesn't get it did it fails with me.

Host 1: No. Totally. I mean.

Client 3: So that's that's But look I think you know, I I I desperately need something now before hopefully we start to accelerate And I think it's the perfect time was. Why it's manageable. Think our found that will I I found it will love it I mean, he he loves the data. Mean he's Id state, bouncing up the walls. Down the time right everyone it's not not any odds and size some, just wants to get into the the data just lost it.

Host 1: Dot and you never know what day that would be.

Host 1: I think it is a founders dream. Like, I definitely spend some hours here myself. Digging into it. So is it safe to say that we are vendor of choice mean, it sounds like it. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. And then so it's As far as, like next steps, we get you a reference call And then it sounds like pricing you like the one year free month twenty k That's.

Host 1: Oh, two months.

Client 3: Yeah. That was my was... But that was what I said. Said I need an extra month.

Client 3: Yeah. Budget brings... That brings a ticket price down in month one offsets the nastiness the exchange rate that I'm dealing with now. And then as I said for you guys, you're gonna you're gonna roll forward in terms of quite quickly into the pricing new book because if it works, then I'm just gonna sign up again. Miss cannot not impossible.

Host 1: Okay. We That it... I do appreciate compromise because I think we mentioned on the last time, but we It's easier for us to say yes the things when our Ac doesn't take a hit. So that actually is something that will bring up as a way to sell this to our team That.

Client 3: And I thought of that jackie. Because we with the same same sound but different. Right? Selling to really. So.

Client 2: Yeah. We can add that up in swing back on during our scoping session. We can do the kind online validation and, you know, resources need on your side and then yeah We can update you on pricing or that session as well.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's just... I think that's where we could could make it all like it work.

Host 1: Awesome. So looking at the calendar since it is your Friday today, how does What time is it for you right now? Is it ten?

Client 3: Ten fifteen pennsylvania yeah.

Host 1: Okay. Could you do a What time is this? A nine am on Tuesday for a scoping call.

Host 1: Okay. So awful and Gertude, and we'll just go through some questions. All debrief for I kind of did. And then she just probably, like, ask you, but that's my source of truth things like that. Then by that time, yeah we'll have a definite answer on that second free one. As well as I'll likely have someone spray to speak with it also.

Client 3: Yeah. Cool. And if there's anything she could send me pray about some other the questions, I... So I could think about it either of the weekend. That'll be helpful. If not, that's okay.

Host 1: Okay. I've asked for that before and last time they told me the questions they asked depend on your answer.

Client 3: So on that, but But last thing, so I guess, if we do that on your Tuesday, you think that you would be able to sign by end of next week or would it like what else.

Client 3: Yeah Yeah. Mean I can sign. I can sign anything at any point. Straight away.

Host 1: And you wanna start implementing also in December, No.

Client 3: January.

Host 1: Okay. Perfect Awesome.

Host 1: Well, Like it's just Service is not that to see is not the heads space to be starting to implement.

Client 3: Just this during my wasted wakes really and it been wasting everyone's time. So I think...

Host 1: Totally.

Client 3: Yeah. I'll come i'll I'll be back early in January. So early January works. Worked for me, whatever is a lot to your availability people. Correct. But again, it's and and again, it's it's it's it's only me. So really? Makes it easy in that respect.
