Host 1: i think that's ease showing up in the conversation, Or is that something that you like kind of mean immediately.

Client 2: Right I... Yes.

Host 1: No. No No It's great. So basically, we're gonna open like a small window during your meetings. That like, lets you easily update your pipeline during your meetings. Some of this I hate you can it don't try to fill them. So, like, that's what I'm gonna do for that field. Seven of the fields we're gonna tell the Ai like summary, like that summary Ai nails that. Gonna be price the Ai does have a really good job.

Client 2: Got it.

Host 1: What's what's that?

Client 2: This is, like, current challenges or pain or anything that I hear in a call put into the pain section.

Host 1: What kind of questions do you ask during the call that and google field.

Client 2: It depends on the call, but usually, whenever I have, like, an introductory discovery call. A lot of it is about Time spent managing current infrastructure, how much time in your day. You spent rain, partitioning vacuuming, planning, around data. Versus how much time is spent. With revenue generating activities like running models or clearing. Or self serving analytics? So that will won't cover a lot of pain there's a you know, a kind of a breath of different of questions. Depending on Yeah. Depending on kinda of where we are in the conversation how much money How much capital is being spent and allocated towards maintaining infrastructure.

Host 1: Got it.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Okay. Things of that nature.

Host 1: That's that's it. Okay. So you ask how much time do you spend doing is? This is that? And that's and that's the kind of thing that done the pinpoint.

Client 2: Yeah. If I can tie it back to time, energy or resources, Right.

Client 2: Great. So I try to ask questions. Around that. How much time is spent? Who who, you know, how many human labor hours per week How does that affect the business? How long has that gone on? What have you done to resolve it? How would this impacted this, you know, the business if this wasn't here today, etcetera, etcetera.

Host 1: Right. Right. Right. Awesome But...

Client 2: yeah. Moving on, I would say, yeah, these are I definitely try to understand what are they using today? What cloud are they on or what region?

Host 1: Then you what kind of questions you. Yeah. Is that like, the actual business what are you using what Cloud on?

Client 2: Yeah. This is these are boring questions. This is just like, hey, what do you what are you using today? Redshift big query, etcetera. That's for the data platform. And then I can kind of infer what cloud their on depending on the technology they use. It's always good just to to double check here. You just in Aws. Sometimes we'll say no. We some instances emphasis in Google or Microsoft. So I always ask that question I i i I do ask science I'll put that right now.

Host 1: What what what what kind of question do you ask? By the way, we don't extract the cushion wheels for we or anything, but we can can train the Ai using it.

Client 2: What are you doing for data science today?

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah.

Client 2: It I would see... Yeah. It is a more technical. Product, I would say relatively. So it might take a little bit more time front to to understand. I would say that's what separates maybe reps that can contribute value a little bit more so than others that you know, I love understanding what it is that I'm preaching chain. Right? So it's Right.

Client 2: He hoo me to understand these questions in A mass and why they even matter and the more I can do that the more, I can the more evaluate. I I would say? But it was a mess when I first time. I didn't understand any of this.

All of these fields exist because there's no other way to track information on organizations that could in field. Like imagine if you had, like a meeting recorder, and then you can ask any questions against your copies of meetings. Right? So you don't need to like, freeze your data in fields. You can just at any point you gonna ray right me ask questions and like, and create fields and fill up fields. Proactively.
