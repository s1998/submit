Client 2: Hi morning, Leaandra.

Host 1: Morning, how are you?

Client 2: Good. How are you doing?

Host 1: Good. How is the weather in Utah right now? Is it super cold?

Client 2: Snowing.

Host 1: Oh, nice. Okay. So... Yeah. Cool. There's some reason I thought you're in the East Coast and then I was No the company in Utah, and then I just checked it. I... I don't know. I guess I got you confused with someone else.

Host 3: Hey, Leaandra take.

Client 2: Hey How's?

Host 3: K how are you doing? Good.

Host 1: Cool. So we have a couple of things to go through Gertude. He's gonna join it at thirty minute mark. Just because I don't want her to sit on the call. We're going other things. But if we need her sooner, then that I think I But I know you want to go through some things with your model. We're gonna talk about pricing, I got approved happy to go with this wherever wherever we you want, I guess we can start with the model and they go to pricing and then go from there based on any questions or the opposite.

Client 2: Yeah. That sounds fine.

Host 1: Cool. So I guess, you wanna share your Perfect. Oh, I think we're having have kit Do you wanna understand screen? Or Yeah.

Client 2: Sure. I'll I'll just kinda give you a sense maybe of you know, what we're looking at here.

Host 1: Cool. Actually, i'm gonna make sure I have that open too.

Client 2: Okay. So I mean, we'll go into this a little bit more during this opening call a little bit. But here's here's kind of our big master model. Of course it has a thousand tabs here.

Client 2: This is just kind of the main summary review just with an Arr waterfall, very high level P and l. Sorry. I can zoom in a little bit. You know, very high level P and L and just kind of some key some key metrics around head counts and, you know, some of the basic saas metrics, magic number Lt to c, some of those kinds of things.

Host 3: Right? Yep.

Client 2: And then here's our kind of our larger three statement financials. We've got our you know, our our cash burn here and when we're gonna cash out And then we have a little bit more detail P l. This is as Andy would call the asp p now where we have it broken out by functional group. With a little bit of allocation happening to the from the Rev ops team to cost of sales here.

Client 2: And then balance sheet and same and cash flows all pretty pretty standard pretty basic.

Client 2: And then farther on, we have just kind of more P and L views by department so that each team can see based on our chart of accounts, you, ad spend employee events and meals, you know, and all that kind of stuff by functional provide by individual department individual team.

Client 2: And then farther in, it's just it's just kind of payroll detail and Op detail, software detail, collection schedule you know, Ar aging, all that kinda all that kind of stuff.

Client 2: Also in terms of kinda of the two the two big things that I wanted to hopefully hopefully cover her the previous version of this model operated off of off of quota capacity model. So, you know, we had our listing of of reps. We had a attainment and ramp assumptions, or... Yeah. We had ramp assumptions. We had payment assumptions, you know, when they're in seeds and ramped equivalent reps and all that kind of stuff. And of course, it would come over here and calculate you know, calculate approximate quota attainment based on all of those reps and now that would feed into our Model Yep.

Client 2: Just barely though for this for this last round we rebuilt the... We rebuild the model. It's connected to this sheet which is more of a I guess, what would you call it? More of kind of pipeline or or lead gen type model. So we have... It's kind of more around the opportunities that are generated by by reps and what each of those opportunities are you know, you know, what's entering the pipe and how often can they schedule opportunities to close loss percentages around some of those things. And we still have our listing of of all our various reps along with kind of planned head counts. Going into the next couple of years, but this is sort of still have the old quota quota model here, but this is this kind of pipeline model is now what we're using to to do our our Arr forecast.

Client 2: Kind of feeding up into ear.

Host 3: So you logo.

Client 2: Expansion, you know, cross selling upsell and then churn down so.

Host 1: And quick quick question on this. So I know that you mentioned that Salesforce isn't the most reliable dataset set, but the pipeline is reliable. It's just not other fields and things like that. Because that's one thing that I'm I know great gonna ask about is just like understanding what you don't trust at a Salesforce and what you do.

Client 2: Yeah. So let me let me show you that, I guess real fast. So this is the other sheet that we'll probably need to try and recreate. We call just sort of our I don't know, Saas metrics master. I don't know if that's the greatest title for it here. But what this basically is is we have we have a Salesforce input where I'm looking for you know, you just... You refresh, it'll bring in all the latest kinda opportunities, renewal, net news, all that kind of stuff.

Client 2: Yep And then all every time we have a new deal come through, with you know, the associated rep and the age and contract start date and billing terms and all that kind of stuff. We drop it into this big master list. So this is kind of our old customer list. And this is the this is kind of the master. So we categorize it by you know, the contract start an end date or months you know, what type it was. We have we have basically two products on either side of purchasing. You know, we have the assessed side where where vendors are or sorry, where buyers are assessing vendors since assessing companies that they want to see their security profile, and then we have vendors or sellers who are providing a security profile to people to purchase them. And then you have the package or platform, So that's kinda what you see here is either set the profile side. Or the platform side. And then we've been basically booking the Arr by by product tracking our upsell and cross sells our down sales returns, and our our renewal periods. And so this is the This is the master Sas you know, this is how we track all of our Arr and everything. The challenge with this is is oftentimes the Salesforce data that might come through here through an import Start dates are incorrect, occasionally even the Arr know, the stated Arr is incorrect. And so every time I book a deal here, I'm logging into my Salesforce portal and just take pulling up the actual contract and verifying that the information correct. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not.

Host 3: And that's that's why I can't fully trust the Salesforce data.

Host 1: How frequently is it incorrect?

Client 2: The the start dates are often incorrect.

Client 2: And they might only be, like a day off or something? But they're they're often incorrect. Arr is usually a little bit more reliable, but even sometimes it's it's not correct either. I have to And so I'll either make the correction myself in Salesforce and try and correct it or ping the rep who entered the deal data or you know, whatever. But But this this is the file that I know is is correct.

Host 1: Got it. Alright. Cool. I don't wanna derail this too much because we'll get into this bit more with Gertude, but this is good context, but just wanted to understand. Like, it sounds like a pipeline is correct. And that's what you can trust coming from Salesforce to build that pipeline build.

Client 2: Yeah. I think I think it is. Yeah. And so obviously, if we were to build this in Mosaic, we would need good assumptions or drivers around Yeah. Around the pipeline and the the rate at which we close those and some of those things And so when we build our Arr forecast, you know, we've gone from quota to this pipeline model in theory, it might actually become more of a blend where for the first first couple of months it's the pipeline and then in outer periods, maybe it's more of quarter model mh.

Client 2: You, who knows, but Cool. So anyway, I guess I'll I'll pause there for a second. How does how does what all that sound in terms of being able to recreate that process within Mosaic.

Host 3: Get the only piece that is really neat on your end that I haven't seen before Is the summary P l by apartment? Yeah. This time. I'm sure we can recreate it within the tool, but I just haven't seen it for given here.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, the the big big one is this. Is this detailed detailed P and L where you can expand each one of these, and it's just... Every every department looks exactly the same.

Client 2: Just based on our chart of accounts, even though there gonna be some line items here aren't utilized by you know, the sales team or something.

Client 2: Yep. But every department looks exactly the same. And then some of the outer periods here are fed by, you know, a more detailed sheet back in here where we're specifically listing out like, Say for the for the people team they want a listing of company events that are gonna do throughout the year and and employee swag and stuff like that. And that kind of detail is important for them to be able to see, but we consolidate it all. Yep. This chart of accounts here, but Definitely.

Host 3: Yeah. That's no problem.

Host 1: Just to clarify as well the top departments. Those are the departments you guys are using in Quickbooks. Right?

Client 2: Yes. These are those departments we're using in Quickbooks. Our accounting manager, I've told him to... He's got he's got Quickbooks numbers for each chart of accounts, you know, unique identifier doesn't yet have unique identifier for the individual departments. But I told him to do that for twenty twenty three. So by... By twenty twenty three, you know, not only each of these chart of accounts have their own unique identifier, but so will the departments you know, that roll into those.

Host 3: Nice.

Host 1: Awesome. Yeah. Maximus. I think you wanna we have, like, these exact models built out in mosaic. So I think it should resonate let we show it.

Client 2: So The name... Let's see. The main thing on my mind though, the other thing that actually I didn't mention was the... Probably the part of this that was the toughest this go around besides the fact that there are which I've kinda mentioned before that they're Throughout this model, there are drivers and assumptions scattered all over the place. And me coming in as as a new to. And just sort of inheriting the model that was a challenge to track everything down. And it... you know, we've changed the things and we've revamped a few things in that better. But the other part of it, that was the biggest challenge that I wanted to ask you about was our was this prepaid schedule. So in the interest of full disclosure, one of the things that Jira has told me they... They say that Mosaic is is rough with this. But I'll let you all that you counter that. Is this prepaid schedule where we have a listing of... you know, from our side, of course, we have a piece of software that we're am over the course of, you know, a calendar year or something like that, and we're recognizing those expense on the P l, But then we have the cash piece of it where we wanna know Okay. At a certain point in the year, we're gonna renew our annual contract and there'll be you know, one time cash outflow up And so we had to build this massive prepaid schedule where you know, we have all of the various kind of software Yep.

Client 2: And you know, the cash outlay, the length of the contract, when it's up for renewal and and tracking all of that. And so for something like It and security, there are they're even within even within the same piece of software, there are user based, usage base, license counts, you know, things need to scale with head count and and there was just a lot of complexities that building out this giant prepaid model mh to kinda see you know, when when things were rolling off when things were rolling on, when cash is going out door, and this is the piece of it that I was curious how how how would Mosaic help me recreate this model.

Client 2: So it's not So dang manual.

Host 3: Yeah. It's a it's a good call out. Realistically get kit the way our customers do this. They just copy and paste this model into Mosaic. Into your prepaid sheet on the balance sheet. And that's where you can model out the inflow and outflow of caps. And then have the amortization of those prepaid as well. To get a really accurate cash forecast. In general, I wouldn't say that there's like, really any tool out there, that would be able to pull in the contract start date contract end dates number of licenses in, like, an automated way. For your vendors.

Host 1: You have that living somewhere?

Host 3: Like I i don't unless you guys have like a vendor management, Well, I I guess what I...

Client 2: I guess the way I kind of think about it is is you know, like, for example, if there's a if there's a contract in here that has twelve you know, twelve month period Yeah. You know, I can state when the contract start an end date is.

Client 2: Mh. But if I were to build a a long range plan that goes out three years I wouldn't want to have to build out something that goes out you know, forever and other and and always keeping track of of having to put in a new contract start an end date every time. You know, if I could just say alright, This is a this is an annually renewing piece of software I wanna tie user cost to the number of head count I have in the company and have the software take care of as opposed to me maintaining it spreadsheet where I might that finger a start date here or an amount here or something like that. Like, that's the piece of it that I would hope to automate a little bit.

Host 3: Yeah. You can absolutely go in those drivers. So like contract by contract. I mean, for your vendors, they're either gonna be license base or they're gonna be like Saas based versus is an annual contract So you can build in like, a per person license costs, by individual vendor and then do budget versus actual by those individual vendors. When you're modeling the cash inflow and outflow, like, whether those contracts far up upfront. Annual contracts or call like quarterly or or bi. Those assumptions, you would have to effectively copy and paste the the schedule into our balance sheet planner. But as we're scaling up, certain expenses or certain licenses that that can be dynamic. So now you've set up the driver as you're adding head count to the head count sheet, that's the only thing we me to focus on.

Host 1: Also worth noting that this is not how it's gonna be for ever, this balance sheet schedule has been brought up a lot or not... I mean, multiple times at least, in our customer side, and so it is on the road roadmap to be changed to be more like this automated fashion. But so far, the focus has been more around the top i'm planning because that's, like, really where more of the focus is, rather like the balance sheet. But it is on a radar. So don't feel like, you know, the way it is when you start is gonna be the way to forever. Typically is never the case. For our right now.

Client 2: K. Yeah. So, like, obviously, here's some, you know, per employee per month you know hundred dollars per month or whatever, like, we anytime somebody starts, they're gonna get a Zoom license and a Google, suite license and you know, those kinds of things.

Client 2: And then we're you know, we'll sum things down here by by vendor you know to see kind of when things are rolling on and off Mh.

Host 3: Yeah. This is the... Yeah. Can automate this process here.

Host 1: Yeah. The only thing that it is gonna be, like, consistent with your current workflow is that prepaid schedule. Everything else is automated.

Client 2: K. Let's see. What did I see? What was I mentioning though with regards to the top line Did we get that covered? Let's see.

Host 1: We haven't shown you our model yet. You want to see a couple different ways of blending sales capacity as well as pipeline.

Client 2: Yeah. See the only other thing to see, I'll show real fast before before we jump over maybe that is it's like, for example, this is our... This is our master list of the whole of all the head counts. Right?

Client 2: Which would feed from feed from Adp. So the hire day base salaries, you know, type of variable comp they might have whether commissioner bonus, Like, all that is standard.

Client 2: Yeah. Then this piece of it right here is what Andy was mentioning where you know, at the job of a hat, he can toggle for positions either either one or zero on or off, and to be able to quickly make those kinds of head count changes when you know, after our after our current head count. Now we come into planned head oh, we're gonna you know, we have five people here are six people here for engineering, Like, maybe we wanna turn off a second software developer here and see the impact of that you know, that's that's the nice thing about this model to be able to very quickly drop in new heads, turn off existing heads, but But when all the budget owners have submitted to me their head counter or hiring plan, I can load all of it in here.

Client 2: Go and keep the keep their master record Yeah.

Client 2: But as I'm sitting in the conversation with my Ceo. He can say, alright let's that start date out let's turn off that position. I think that's redundant. you know, without necessarily deleting wholesale the plan position.

Host 1: Mh. Yeah. This is definitely something that with a spreadsheet and all the formulas. It is super quick. I would say just with a platform, it's a little bit harder to do this without saving it. But on the flip side, reconciliation process, I think is automated a little bit more, but creating the scenarios for this is like, three clicks, and you just have to go in and change. The the axle role, but can... I mean, we can show you how quick that is. It really shouldn't cause too much disruption your workflow, but it will be a different workflow.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 3: Awesome. K. Where do you wanna start on the forecast?

Client 2: Yeah. Show me to show me the top line piece.

Host 3: Okay. Cool. So with the top line forecast? A couple things here. Just have an air snowball built up. By month. This would be completely automated at the historical through. In this example, it's just through July and then rolling it forward month by month. And then you can build individual drivers for, like, up sell down cross sell churn. What have you? But this new Arr row Cool part about this is we're pulling in your historical. Directly from either the Google sheet that you would upload or in the future Salesforce. And then for the future period, we're using a formula here that's built down below. So here we're pulling our enterprise bookings cal. In this example, it's a quota based build Right? Just face off of reps in the productivity, but you can absolutely build this to be a like, opportunity or or pipeline builds. But then this is driving your new Arr.

Client 2: And this exam is that template there though already the pipeline build? Or or what's the or is the the default the quota capacity?

Host 3: So When you create a new model, It's really like a blank sheet. That gives you the ability to start from scratch, but all of the metrics are gonna be there for you to model off of. So you click into this top line planner here? And it's gonna be completely blank. And then this is where you can click into row five and you can say, hey, let's pull in r opportunities created. So our leads. Right? And then you can pull in all of your historical leads. You can build this up in the by role and you can add in specific filters here as well. So if you wanted to you know, bi by inbound versus bounds, by Ae driven versus Sdr driven, you'd have that ability here as long as it's tracked within Salesforce. So In this example, we can just say, hey, Let's take like, our historical ops created. And then maybe we wanted to pull in call it like, our Asp of these ops created and then we know know, based off of these two metrics, like, what's our opportunity amount? So it's gonna take maybe two, three, four hours to build up this forecast. Within the tool, but once it's created, the easy part is it's just gonna be automated month to month. Right? Because these are just actual that we're pulling in. From Salesforce for you.

Host 1: Worth noting as well that we do walk you through or we're gonna hand you through, like, building up either your existing model, which markers maybe flip over the snow model that we have built.

Host 1: So the models that you have are pretty standard for us. We just can't have, like, templates because they really are gonna be, like, a little bit this spoke to you. I mean, maybe we... I mean, we could definitely think about acc templates. But it's not difficult, although it may seem like oh my gosh start with Empty sheet. To build these up because it is all automated. And just one more point on what you showed us before. So We do snapshot your Salesforce. You don't have to be doing that anymore in unless like want to and you're do those manual manipulation. But ideally, you know, we should get you to a place where your Salesforce date is a little bit cleaner. That's kind like what I wanted to bring Gertude on just to help guide you to... I know you have the rentals person starting, but like, help put proxies in place around that to make sure that that's a little bit cleaner and then it should be a lot less of manual manipulation on your end.

Client 2: Yeah. And then I think you also mentioned that there's some sort of I came remember what you called it.

Client 2: Like, what's available to renew basically yes.

Host 1: Yeah. Mark maybe let's show that on the canvas first, and then and then we'll flip over to sign. So that's a standard metric for us because people say all the time like, hey. I don't care if you know, this account is not being renewed. I don't wanna be applying a certain renewal rate to it or a dollar retention. So we have the metric bookings up for renewal. And what it's doing is it's pulling in that renewal date from Salesforce and then the contract amount in the future And this is just one area where Salesforce integration becomes really powerful is being able to see these feature announced think we when we talked about this last time it was in the context of, you know, once you're cs team members like, go after checking accounts, things like that. But you'll be able to see here the amount the date that is going up for renewal. And then because we can pull any of these metrics onto that top line planner to then use it or forecasting, we'll just have those amounts in here and then you can apply certain, like, a dollar retention rate or a turn rate or, however you wanna be forecasting this out. Yeah.

Client 2: What was the other question I had? Shoot.

Host 1: No worries. And also, any of these metrics can be filtered down to the screen levels. If you want to look up only enterprise bookings up for a renewal or that one product you guys have can definitely split all this. So well, you can start out with Mosaic and with a model exactly like, how you guys have it today, Most likely, it's gonna be so easy to get this a lot more accurate and more granular because of the integrations that you're gonna be adjusting your model to you know, adding in these waterfalls and making it a little bit more accurate.

Client 2: Yeah. Because ideally, that that giant check saas metric sheet that, you know, has the import coming from Salesforce and everything else Ideally, I'd I'd like to get rid of that or replace that. And and if there was a... I mean, it if there was a live link coming from Salesforce where every time a new deal comes through, it's populating on that list of customers prevent, you know, that would be great but is their ability even though I would want the automated at least as a starting point coming from Salesforce, if if in that interim period where there's still some quality data quality issues whatever. Can I make manual edits to to to a Salesforce import.

Host 3: Mh. Yeah. Let me walk you through an example. This is what we do internally. Hit. This is like, our model in the way we look at it, we've pull in opportunities, which ones are closed one, which ones are still active. What are the conversion rates by month, the win rates by month? By stage then we just have, like, a pipeline adjustments column. Our head of kind of rev ops biz ops, this is what he uses. He just takes our pipeline as is, but then we'll just add in, you know, manual adjustments to that number. For like the finance forecast quote on unquote. So you can build in haircuts. You can append that data.

Client 2: But I mean, what I would I make it on the cost summer level or would I make it kind of broad strokes on the high level?

Host 3: It's up to you.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. In this example, we're doing a broad stroke But you could do it however you wanted, it...

Client 2: Because ultimately, I I want the... I want the master for customer list to be accurate. And so the first time we've pull in all the Salesforce data, I already know that there's gonna be fifty dates in there that are gonna be wrong or or amounts they're gonna be wrong. But maybe there's two hundred that are correct. And so I'll want to go through and make sure that for the time being I'm adjusting and and making corrections where I need to based on my master list and then going forward, I'll just have that be part of the process to Qa. Every time a new deal comes through to make sure that it's pulling through correctly.

Host 1: So when you're checking against the contract, and you find an incorrect start date, let's say, this this not getting adjusted in Salesforce to be the correct date.

Client 2: Sometimes it is. But the... But the source of truth is that Google sheet Okay.

Host 1: If you wanted to do one time adjustments, you definitely could. Obviously, it's a little bit more manual just because you're gonna be going into every single one when there is. An adjustment to be made. So it it's up to you. That's kind of why in this case, our right outside george, he just does, like, a broad stroke, but you definitely could do the individual. Like, you if you wanted to, you could build up your pipeline based on individual deals. I don't... It sounds like your business model wouldn't be made for that, just like, how ours is? You know, you had similar sized deals in their coming through at a pre high clip, but if you want to do that, you could.

Client 2: But... Well just even for the... Even for the historical import the first time that we're we're doing that as part of the implementation process. If if we use Salesforce to build historically Arr, it wouldn't be right.

Host 1: Yeah. No. We could actually build your historically Arr with your Like, that's actually pretty common. We take a back of what your source of truth is and I actually asked her to to come in ten minutes late just so I think we were still talking about this. And then... And you guys also have a pretty easy business funnel, so I don't think we need to scope too much, but that's exactly what we often do. And then we'll go forward with better processes and then have the live sync only on a go forward basis.

Client 2: K. Cool.

Host 1: I also do wanna show you flipping over to the aside just an example of exactly what you guys have in your metrics not so sheet. So saas metrics you guys have, If we just wanna make, like, a custom report or really, you know, anything. We already have, like, an example of Sas built out, but if you guys want to add anything to this, could pretty much have this a running live data pull that you guys can just reference just like how you have it today?

Client 2: Yeah. There's... Obviously, there's lots of places where yeah. We're reporting on unit economics or, you know, some of those kinds of things. So, yeah. This is the part of tool I'm I'm excited about too. Because I... you know, right now for a monthly board meeting or anything, I'm having to refresh data refresh charts, all that kind of stuff. And so the automated piece of this will be really nice.

Host 1: Cool Maybe we should talk payment you know, pricing and all that robust.

Host 1: Awesome. Do you get everything you need out of the top line everything like that?

Client 2: I think so. Yeah. I mean, that that prepaid side is still a little bit ne for me. How exactly the best way to do that to you know, because I... it it works. I don't love it though.

Client 2: I I want to improve that process.

Client 2: Way. We've got it now. So Quickly here this is the balance sheet that you're looking yet.

Host 3: This is how you can create different drivers. So let's say you're modeling Capex for every net new engineering hire. That are full time employees and they're gonna get, like, three k worth of black laptops. This is how you can build those per person drivers. So it's easy to all in the future. And then the way the prepaid would work if you do have large prepaid or if you wanted to just drop in this prepaid schedule, I copy and paste it from your sheet, that's the way that you can get it in the tool pretty quickly.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. I I would imagine that part of it'll be Oh, you know, a little more lengthy or part of the implementation process to make sure that that's working and going. Right Yep.

Host 1: Yeah. And I did note to product and I tagged our Cp. So just so he knows that it's it's one a sticking point, but also that our competitors are using against us, which makes it even more urgent honestly, so definitely expect some kind of improvement within your first license to mosaic, but I think that's also a different here for Mosaic. Is that we are innovating so quickly like, a lot of features we showed you like the forecasting and the water came out and last, like month to three months, like what came out three months ago. What forecasting came out just now, so we're constantly listening feedback and making our product better. Cool. Cool. So getting into pricing here, Let me share my screen. So I know you mentioned a couple things. You saw you talked about having, like the one year on option. I did just go ahead and get it to your options. You can, like, look at the difference. One thing about, like, up is that you know, our implementation is definitely by no means like, I would say people, but you are doing an implementation, and so people typically do think about this as being, like a longer term relationship. I just wanted to see what kind of discount I could get for you if we did do to your term. I was hoping to hopefully keep the net thirty just because we do typically do not ten, but if you guys will do not sixty, it's something that I can go back and ask for. But what we have for you is two different options here. So It's twenty six thousand. This is like the the number for the one year term. However, we're gonna do fourteen month contract. So anyways is down to just over twenty two thousand. I think you guys mentioned that you do this. We do this pretty often. Our investors because we do have all can eat model or asking us, hey, razor or blower and hit your ac up because we are giving our whole product away and upgrades as well, which is changing by the way in next year. So February next year, And so we do have to keep our ac be a little bit higher, but to combat that and just give you guys a bit more on giving those two extra months. So taking six thousand off this sas and then five thousand loft implementation And then, of course we can work out the terms here. If you were able... Interested to do it to your option, it does look down to twenty five thousand so you do get a lot closer or not know a thousand dollars closer to that twenty thousand number, and we can do a ten percent renewal cap. So just having a very for forecast cost for the next two years. I know that they're not too too different, but to be honest, we're agent in our growth where we're more focus on our growth in the short term rather than, like our retention at this point. So that's why it's not, like a huge huge i him to go to two year, but it really is supposed to be like kind of equitable across both options for you. K Yeah.

Client 2: I mean, I think this is okay. And then I mean, the net sixty is not a sticking point. You know, my Vp was like, I would be shocked that they didn't do they didn't at least offer, like net forty five. Is that possible?

Host 1: Anything over, like, next three is a major approval and anything over that is a c cofounder approval which is line. I can definitely ask, Like, we we kind of are aggressive with our net ten, but people often like, just say, hey, we need to get thirty and we say, okay. That's fine. So let me ask on that five. I mean, that is less of a concern for us, than our Ac like maintain our Ac out.

Client 2: Yeah. Us do. Actually, I mean, I I would prefer you know, lower pricing versus you know, net thirty net forty five payment terms.

Client 2: What do you think like this like the two months break.

Host 1: You'll get it either way and I know that this kind of is like you know, all your pre are twelve months and we're coming here with a fourteen months. So and it's a little bit different, but Hopefully, you can you know, understand the sentiment behind it. What do you think about that?

Client 2: Yeah. I I think that's I think that's that's in the ballpark of kinda where we were thinking maybe let me i'll I'll pass that onto to my Vp as well. Cool. But I I appreciate your work on this too.

Host 1: Yeah. Definitely. And so and just I know it sounds super sales like, hey. We're taking here pricing terms. But we actually are going towards like, a more sku based pricing, so it is gonna get honestly, a lot more complex next year, which, you know, is not in my favor, but it's the company wants. So this is gonna give you all future upgrades, including that price. So all those custom metrics are getting all the, you know, potential database that you guys wanna bring in in the new year. You guys will not see any increases for that.

Client 2: Sorry. You say that last piece again?

Host 1: We're... So we're gonna be having database connectors as well as the customer a metric builder. And so that pretty much opens us up to being able to be like, pretty much a full Bi tool, and you guys won't have to pay for that. You did eventually wanna get into like, your engineering team with their you know, jira tickets or lasting tickets or anything like that. You actually could do a lot of visualization on that end without having to get like, a like dom or tableau or anything like that.

Client 2: Okay. Cool Do you think...

Host 1: I mean, so I know that we're still a little bit competitive with graph. I mean, I I could definitely go into some more differentiator, but I am curious to know, like, from your perspective what are you leaning towards?

Client 2: So I I was hoping to avoid having to do a scoping call with Jira I went ahead and and the they've been they've even pinging me wanting the one two one two I'm doing one tomorrow with them And, you know, we've signed an Nda to kinda show them basically the same thing we showed you I I've had... I'll I'll just say this. I've had way more positive feedback about Mosaic I have about Jira ave which makes me inclined to go this route. So I would say, you know, this is the top option and has at this point.

Host 1: Gotcha. Yeah. And what well, one thing about Jira drive as you are going through it is Like, you they might show you something like, with Mosaic, we are you things that are out of the box and how you're gonna get them with drive, if they are showing you guys, like a fully built out demo. It's most likely that they had to build out that demo they're have to build it out. You. So I would actually argue that their implementation times would be longer than Mosaic to get you guys to a place where you actually want it to be and the place where they end you is gonna be nowhere near where we're gonna end. Like, for example, with the Salesforce imports, their sales connection just honestly isn't not strong. And with the Quickbooks, it doesn't get granular as we're getting with, like, beyond Gl level data.

Client 2: Yeah. I that it's big... That's definitely a big piece it.

Host 1: So Yeah. Cool. I don't wanna harp on it too much. I honestly don't really like like to let our tool speak for itself, and I don't like to harp on competitors too much, but I brace on now. So Gertude. Just give you some background we got into a little bit today. So there is some Nuance to their Salesforce as far as, like, accuracy goes. And so Kit has a source of truth that he references or everything historical just because sometimes there are differences in the start dates. And there's amounts are not hundred percent correct I was mentioning him that we could do like, a path for the historical then go forward with a dynamic build, but I'll let him speak to a little bit more. They also do use and are not using a further source of truth today. Cool.

Client 4: Nice to meet you.

Client 2: Hi, Christie hi.

Client 4: Cool. Yep. So I'm just I'm I'm from the data team and. I I lead our technical scoping practice Merry goal here today is just you get an understanding of hydro your top line and and see how we could support you with that. So so I like from what was the say that? We have sales and saas, maybe not the data. So you maintain a separate patch file Do you have any Do you any plans to to maybe clear up Salesforce at all or come up with a new process going and forward that would allow how you the lie on that data. That subject for that matter.

Client 2: Yeah. We do. We we hired a Salesforce admin about a month ago.

Client 2: Couple goals is cleaning up data. And he's he's been actually really good so far. As of right now, though I have I haven't basically, Google sheet that has a Salesforce import script that pulls in pulls in new deal data whenever something gets entered into Salesforce. I go in and based on what Salesforce is telling me, i actually manually pull up the contract and verify start days and amounts and all that kind of stuff and I can trust... I can trust Salesforce maybe to completely pulling everything correctly. I can trust it maybe seventy of the time.

Client 2: Otherwise, Otherwise, I'm making corrections and edits to the data and I have a master sheet where I have a full listing of all of our customer accounts, associated start dates, Arr, you know, contract terms, billing terms, all that kind of stuff that I that I maintain and is our source truth for all of our recording.

Client 4: Okay. So so for that thirty percent the the data that's coming from Salesforce and that and that triple isn't accurate. You're just updating it in that then that spreadsheet that's not going into Salesforce.

Client 2: No. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's just loading a go. Sometimes sometimes the had gets made in Salesforce, but order to be able to completely trust it, I would go... I would have to go through our full customer list Okay. And annually verify in Salesforce, which I just don't have the time to do.

Client 4: Yeah. Thought makes sense. Okay. So like miss Leaandra mentioned yeah the historical patch is probably gonna do be the best bet, but I'd like to get to get a better understanding of kind of where that data goes eye. What what's her process in place? That cause that data to be an accurate thirty percent of the time to to see if if there's a change to that process coming up with the sales Salesforce admin or or anything like that.

Client 2: Yeah. Sure thing. So I guess, just as for example here, So here's the here's the master sheet. Right? Has listing over. Customers and the associated accounts and opportunity Ids that Salesforce generating Let mean log in here real quick. So this is the the script that I'm refreshing every time a new deal comes through and just auto populates on here at the bottom with the name of the deal and you know, amounts and product contract billing terms, all that kind of stuff. And then I've... you know, I've got a couple formulas in here that will say, okay. Go go look at the opportunity Id based on that tab and pull in whatever you think we real restart data is, but if I follow this and say you know, come in here to Salesforce, look at the deal, Let's see. Probably won't take long to find when that's wrong. Been changing it. Twelve twenty two. I don't know. Anyway, Yeah. Usually, it's usually the most common errors on start and end date. Okay. So you know, you have the... You have the contract start end date here list in Salesforce, but then I'm coming into the contract you know, pulling up the deal and just verifying, okay, What are the are the terms of the contract here? And then that's when I'm making sure gets entered right here. So I so that I have the appropriate Start date. And then off to the far right here is where we're tracking, we have kind of two main products the call assessment profile where I'm tracking the Arr by product. And any associated upsell cross sell contraction churn, turn, along with implementation fees, contract billing terms, you know, the age of how long you took the opportunity to close, things like that. Okay associated you know, up on the account.

Client 4: Okay. Cool. Yep. So that we see this all the time where the data coming out of Salesforce is not as great as we maybe like to see it. So i I think the the historical patch makes them most sense, because you know that the state is accurate And then if maybe in, like, the beginning of the year, any process but into into place that make sure that that data is accurate, then we could hold dynamically from Salesforce and and hopefully give you some time back so you're going in and manually checking, all these oh these different contracts. As far as kind of your your process for closing out a deal, there are there any checks that this has to be go through, like, you deal desk or anything like that where it has to get basically approved by finance or anything like that. But before the deal is closed.

Client 2: You know, besides besides signatures, whatever. There's not necessarily any process for them to verify your Qa the data Is that what you're asking?

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. No. They... I mean, this the reps is going in. They're they're entering the amounts you know, thirty percent of the time it's wrong. Which is why I'm checking.

Client 4: Okay. Okay. I I seen i'll be pretty effective with some of our some of our other customers that have just tough data in Salesforce is having making so that there is x off from finance or something. Usually it's a little bit quicker than for you to do it, as the deal is being closed, and hopefully, it keeps the beta clean in Salesforce so you can use it accurately in Salesforce as well other their products like what as opposed to you having to go in check and make sure that the data is accurate. In this spreadsheet, but it still might not be accurate in Salesforce. I I just see that lead finish issues with a source of truth problem. If that's something that you would be interested in and in maintaining clean, cleaner salesforce data. Then I this data would be very straightforward to pull through at demos mosaic and we could automate you're doing here. Otherwise, we can just go with a full time Poc the upload so you can upload all of your of your like, opportunity data into the app and and we could do top line in that way as well.

Client 2: I mean, even if it was just for the first go around loading all of the correct historical here and then going forward, you know, it it pipes in from Salesforce, and I just you with the the Qa process I'm doing now until we can put some internal systems in place processes in place to keep better key the data. Like, that would be would be fine. I mean, it all that all this data here sees this Ludicrous.

Client 2: Some here. You know, I mean, it has kind of the basic stuff basic Arr data here. But then it just goes on forever which just a million different slices of customer data by product and you know, logo mix and retention... I mean, there's just a million pieces of data here that it's just the file is way too un these days. And I would love to condense or summarize or, you know, get rid of this thing wherever possible.

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

Host 1: K... One thing is, I mean, your data from what you're telling us is not by any means, I would say that in even the top fifty percent of messy data. Like, this is kind of like a cleaner perspective. Honestly, you'd be just because your business model and what you're saying and that you have everything tracked. I actually just brought Gertude on not because there's any concerns around your day but more to help out. If you guys are open to changing things and having best practices, that really is where our team also shines as being able to give you guys like here's we're other people that are similar in your business. That way you guys syncing clean things up, and it becomes a lot more automated.

Client 2: Yes, ma'am. Yeah. I'm I'm totally open all that.

Host 1: Cool.

Client 4: Yeah. And that's something that we do lot in the so kind of in a post sales world when you get to implementation, you'll go through a technical scoping open call where we'll get an understanding of how your sales for data structured or if we wanna to post optics, whatever how historical patch file is structured. So we can we know how to how to build it out. And in those calls, we... A lot of the time we'll do some level of consulting on. If you were to do this, then we'd be able to pull this way which would give you bread insights or something like that. And then we also have just resources we have plugs in ebooks and podcast podcasts on un crm data, so happy to share all that as well.

Client 2: Yeah. Awesome Cool, Gertude probably the easiest scoping call.

Host 1: I've had you on too.

Client 4: I know there's like Cool.

Host 1: Well, I guess last time minutes here, Gertude actually and Maximus if you also wanna hop off, I know we have a call coming up so you proper you too. But I I would love to send you over, like, a first draft of a order form. So I can send you both, but if you do have a per option between the one and the two year. It is to even opt an option for you guys or It yeah.

Client 2: We'll probably do a one year.

Host 1: I don't okay.

Client 2: Don't I don't think we'll do a two year for now.

Host 1: Okay. That's fine. If you did... So I I honestly just wanna...

Client 2: Like a significant difference in price here. So Yeah.

Host 1: And I guess, before if you were to make any decision, and there is any concerns. Got really anything I know the balance sheet is sounds like the major the biggest one that we're not able to completely alleviate.

Client 2: Believe exactly I I honestly... I don't think I really had too many concerns from the top line side of it, although I recognize that why it's such important point of focus. I think Again, we're such a simplistic business model. I just didn't really think we have too many concerns or things that we couldn't overcome there. The the part of it yeah. That that still is giving me a little bit of anxiety is is on the balance sheet side. Because I neither and or, I feel that great about the way we're currently forecasting our balance sheet.

Host 1: And the passes.

Client 2: Is you know, front center and every conversation that is our that needs to be just super clean until you know, feel real solid. I think I think almost anything would be better than the than the spreadsheet you know, way we're doing it now. You know, whether that was Jira ever or any other tool, I think it probably is probably frankly an improvement over what we're doing now.

Client 2: It's just a question of which which tool gets us the farthest Yeah.

Host 1: Let me talk to my product team and see where that is on the run just to give you some clarity and I can send you an update. And just Given that, I mean, objection. I know that Drive is a lot i don't know actually how much less but I know they're less than us. And so let me see if I can potentially just match the second year cost for the one year option, just, like, give you guys a little bit more of a price and get you get closer that twenty thousand number. Yeah. I'll I'll actually get an answer on that today and just see if we can, you know, do that. That way you guys get what you need it as far as one year, and then we can get a little bit closer to that twenty thousand now.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. That would that would be great. Like I said, they they were I mean, I'm sure they're gonna give me more detailed information tomorrow. They said, they said twelve to twenty. So with twenty being their top, and twenty what we budgeted like, that's where that's where stars were aligning a little bit better. But I you know, I I haven't been too shy and telling you that Mosaic has been my preferred tool from the Get go. And so you know, but I don't want to I don't wanna walk into you know, I'm I'm trying to objectively evaluate as best I can. And I know from your side he would say, oh we're clearly the better tool. And you probably frankly are and and I don't wanna make that.

Host 1: Because I like in your head, you you know it, so you haven't been expressing it very much. So for me, it's been more of like a does can't like it or not, kind of situation. But so it's Good to at least know what you're saying because it's easier for me to ask for this discount if I have more confidence that hey, if we offer this you know, lower discount it gonna fall through? Or is it gonna come through? So it's helpful for sure.

Client 2: I mean, I I I joined a... There's a Slack there's a Slack based channel for finance and accounting professionals and I ping, you know, probably hundreds of thousands of people, like ping the channel of, like, you know, what are your preferred finance tools? Here's a couple that we've been evaluating and And there were... I mean, There was... Mosaic came up a lot. The other one that came up a lot was actually calls all, which was one of my original six that I had put on my my short list. And I chose not to go forward, but I what's considering them based on the amount of feedback I was getting on them. But but on Jira ave and on plan, it was crickets. And so you know, time I see somebody say like, oh, yeah, we just implemented Mosaic. It's been great so far like giving me more of a confidence that this is the right path. It's just you know, operating within the constraints, so of the budget and the number that we had originally put forth, I guess, Got it.

Host 1: I mean, not saying we can do this, but just so I can understand if we were, like, twenty thousand. Would you guys be like, obvious option. Just wanna see like how much I can probably that Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. Let me let me see what I can do don't think we're get below twenty five k, but let me just, you know, see if there's was anything else that we can offer, but that's good to hear.

Client 2: Yeah. I again, I I know no tool is gonna be two gonna be perfect. No tools gonna check every single box and I get that. So you know, That's okay.

Host 1: Okay. Good Cool. Awesome. Well, yeah, I'll I'll get approval and I'll send over a sample form. Assuming we you guys have a security process just because you guys are Security team. What does that look like?

Client 2: Yeah. I've actually already submitted Mosaic for kind of a pre assessment review by our security lead. And and that's been approved. So no major concerns there. I had two I had to guess a little bit in terms of the level of the level of access, client will client and employee data that Mo would have access to As far as i understand though, Once we go forward with the integration, the one I didn't know was whether you would have access to client contact information Like, you would have the listing of customer names, Arr, but would you also have all the all like you know, email addresses and phone numbers and stuff for our customers.

Host 1: No. So when we pull in Crm, and I can send, So essentially, when we integrate with your Crm, it's gonna pull over every single like, field and object, but you guys choose what we actually have in the tool. So if unless you check that information, we're not gonna have it.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That that's good news then. Yeah. So like I said, I've already submitted it and and from a security assessment standpoint. Mosaic been kind of pre approved. And maybe there's a... Maybe there's a secondary process that happens once we actually sign on the dotted line, but for now, don't have any concerns from that side.

Host 1: Cool. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So let me just get some approvals on seeing if we can get lower and for the one year, also check on the net forty five. And I'll send you over the order form. And then, I guess, next steps from here. I know you have a a call a dr tomorrow. So when should we check back in for whether it's a decision or additional... discussions, And i also have an answer for you on where the balance sheet items are on the road.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Having a good sense of the balance sheet map would actually should be would be a good good piece of it and helping making the final decision too. Again, knowing that Mo. Can't do everything, but that things are on the pipe, like, in the pipeline, that would be great. So At least from a pricing standpoint, if you're able to send that over tomorrow, that would be great. You know, whenever whenever you have that then I may be taking Friday off, but the potentially Talked to you guys and then and then Drew up tomorrow I can potentially make a decision maybe by Thursday end of day, Okay or maybe early next week, we have kind of a long Christmas break, and I know I told you I wanted to kick off implementation before that.

Client 2: We may or may not be able to do that. But We also have a a Christmas break.

Host 1: So we're off between Christmas and New years and if you guys want to kick off next week, we... So we typically like have around five days in between sign and kick off, that's something that could be flexible because I don't think anyone else kicking off next week as far as like, everyone just push the new year. But if you could get a decision by Thursday, we could see about, like, doing, like, Tuesday if you wanted to Yeah.

Client 2: I mean If we were to wait until the new Year, are we gonna fall into some giant backlog of of implementations and not feel like wouldn't it be a backlog?

Host 1: Because we definitely cap the amount of people that we're willing to assign. It doesn't look like... I mean, this could change because, obviously, like, a lot of dealing gonna be coming in in the next week and a half But as of right now, it doesn't look like it's that backlog. Like, a lot of people are kinda what it, like, taking vacation, so it's kinda like progressively even throughout the first month of January. So up to you, I mean, like, obviously, I don't want you guys to lose a week of contract, like, that's not really a lot, but at the same time, like, it's a week of not doing things. So can definitely wait till a January, but we can also do it week if you guys can make a decision this week.

Client 2: Yeah. Because I've already cleared with my Vp that this is kind of my main my top priority is making sure this implementation goes smooth and getting up to speak quickly just because I told you we got a budget cycle again that we're doing, and I know most companies probably are not doing that.

Client 2: And but I've got... I've gotta be ready to go and up to speed you know, early spring. So I do need to have I can we can always change this.

Host 1: But for start date, what are you thinking? It's just I can put on the or form.

Client 2: Start date meaning, post implementation.

Host 1: No. Start data when you should start implementation.

Client 2: I mean, I can I can start I could probably start Tuesday.

Client 2: Okay. Next week. And then I'm... I think I'm out Thursday on until the next year until the New Year.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: That's fine.

Client 2: Basically gonna be two days and which is not much, but Yeah.

Host 1: Let me you wanna have a kickoff call on Tuesday.

Client 2: Potentially.

Host 1: Okay. I'm gonna see it for you guys as well. I can have the date be January, but like, maybe, we just do a kickoff before then because I Like, our team is also gonna the office we're not gonna be building anything between that either. So maybe we could do that. Let me just check on that.

Client 2: Tuesday or Wednesday? I'm out Thursday. Otherwise, yeah, we're we're starting in the New year.

Host 1: Is potential. And then for finances or the accounts cable email. What is the best email for that?

Client 2: See. I think it's just I think it's just accounting at. Sorry. I'll ping you Okay.

Host 1: No worries.

Client 2: I'll that out to that email.

Host 1: Cool. If there's just because if you did wanna have a start day of next week, if there's like, know twenty k, but, like, realistically, we can't get to that number, but if there's anything we can do to get an answer today, like, if we could annual analyze it to as close to that number as we can with the fourteen months, would that potentially get it done today.

Client 2: Possibly. I mean, I I can always I can always Okay.

Host 1: Let's see. Because if we could just do fourteen times twelve. So if we could do twenty four five And at fourteen months, that invoice is twenty one thousand.

Client 2: That's pretty good.

Host 1: Okay. Let me ask for that approval. And then, yeah, if we can save you the meeting tomorrow, we could just get it done say that we can have the week and start next week, then, then let's do that.

Host 1: Let's get done. Yeah. Let me let me do some stuff. I'll email you, I have a meetings until one So I'll you email you right after that.

Client 2: K. Thanks Leaandra. Appreciate it.
