Client 1: Cool. How was everyone sort new when call day break My was really good.

Client 2: Spent some time with family. Got to hang out with some friends on New Year's eve. Had a blast allergy.

Client 1: Yeah. It it was good kinda thing i didn't. Trouble anything, but stay local. Know did more stuff with yep runs. And got some free time there so it was all good.

Client 2: Saying spending time with friends is always great. It's nice to kinda recharge and then, you know, get ready for q one and, you know, start off strong.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And... Yeah, I'm doing a little bit up today, but probably some the stuff i'll be focusing on this this week it it's, like, getting things like up with some of the, you know, more strategic targeting waiting delivery for kinda, like, larger sized account since that will be will that look like you know, for prolong champions campaigns and some senses. Like, we're still gonna focus on getting those easy wins. But having a better day having a bit of a balance in So Cool.

Client 1: That's that's sorta of just to get a to the tone head from my week. I guess it's it as. I know andrew was on location I think you should be back. So wanna wanna make sure. See if he's started as well. Or you guys as you're getting kind a settled back and? Is there anything on your end that you're that would sort of help help enable or anything.

Client 2: No. Everything is great with me right now. So I am totally okay in that department.

Client 1: Okay. Cool. And... I'm assuming you guys both have, like a good amount of people. That's said hey anyway can you call me about him?

Client 2: So that's yeah.

Client 1: Your focus on this week. It's like Hey, you know, you told me to call you back in the new year area. You know, on the first day calling you this looking that meeting.

Client 2: Yep. Totally. Yeah. I have about fifteen people that I'm reaching out to in q four. That, you know, I wanted me to follow up with them in q one. So gonna reach out to those people to just this week in general, try to get him back on the phone and see where they are and you know, see if we can get them into a meeting and, you know, we'll go from there.

Client 1: Very cool. Tell, what about... What about you?

Client 3: Yeah. I It's been most my morning doing confirmations for all the meetings today, and then I do have some people on for this week in next week for Callbacks. On my little Google. So I'm try to hit them up, but basically, you're gonna just try to get through all the All the calls has been kinda slow. Honestly, just gives seven. Doing more digging. Noticed a lot of the numbers are the correct number. So I'm just double checking everything. When I'm going through the accounts What do you when do you say doing more checking?

Client 1: Like, do you mean it to be the list of kinda just people to call that you've given in or Just anybody that's in my list my the processing...

Client 3: Like, that has all the lists in it Okay.

Client 1: Because if it's just like a that the there's.

Client 3: Into to the one list, so it's just easier to see everything. So just been making sure that all the numbers are correct and the emails are correct. And stuff.

Client 1: Okay. If i'm it's just like a cold prospect. It's not, you know, like, a meeting you said or maybe a hot lead and there's like a long wait stress too much about finding the right one because those can be... I can like, just add more to the list with with better numbers. So i I just wanna make sure that, like, you're using your time, because it's probably faster me us to give a new list of people with right numbers in there like, for some reason, you have some without recurrent. Than like, go again digging through the Internet for numbers, because that's kind of That's that's one of the main reasons I provide those advanced that you guys don't have to do you know, do do a bunch of research or or crushing on people?

Client 2: Yeah. You definitely make it very easy on that. So that's sometimes though kelly like you will get wrong number, could just be possibly they change the their number. From the last time that we've, you know, reached out to them or, you know, maybe updated it, but Yeah.

Client 1: But that is never hundred percent perfect ivan.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Exactly. That or the person like the company or or something, you know. Yeah.

Client 2: Exactly. But about nine, I I've had insane success, like, ninety five percent of the numbers, maybe even higher than that. Our correct numbers or, you know, maybe they change the company. That's where that five percent is at or you know, change phone numbers. But Yeah. Definitely don't spend too much time digging.

Client 3: No. I'm just doing it while the calls calling i just call, and then I looked just while it's calling real quick.

Client 3: I mean, I just top Linkedin link is right there, so just pop in Yep.

Client 2: See... Yeah. That's what I need to. Yeah. I always always clicked... I always look at their profile while I'm speaking with them. Maybe learn a little bit about their product. So when I'm speaking with them, I have some knowledge about it.

Client 1: Yeah. That I agree not definitely. To maybe. Both the website. While their number is ringing to see Yep.

Client 1: You know, more and more familiar with all. Don't no. I'm says types of products that they have in our. And also just to train your brain at tim multitask. Which sounds was good to be able to talk with someone and then look at their look at their so I'm gonna speak to unique things you see about their account without having to kind of feel into you're getting pulled into many directions.

Client 2: Yeah. I actually have a meeting that I got today with customer and what's actually supposed to be held today as well. So we're supposed speak with him at two Pm Pacific time. And I think that's three pm mountain time. You said what?

Client 3: Was it a today for today?

Client 2: Yeah. Today for today. Yeah. It's guy Yeah.

Client 2: Ten minutes of your time. He's like. Yeah. You know, where are you located? Us like I'm in California. He's like, okay. So how's is two pm your time? Was like, today, He's like, yeah. I like, perfect. He was going into a meeting right before I spoke with him. So it was just a quick a quick chat, but was able to get he does three thousand orders a month and he's average order value is twenty bucks. Twenty dollars. So I'm not sure if that's big enough or if that's someone that we're looking for, but I really don't know what qualifies someone in or out, but I put that in my notes. So Malik has a heads up. As we go into the meeting later today.

Host 4: Yeah. So basically... And and I'll kind speak to that as long as they do over a thousand dollars a month in revenue, then they would qualify.

Client 2: Okay. In the revenue side.

Client 2: Yeah. Looks. Okay.

Host 4: Three three twenty.

Client 2: So he's like six thousand, so that's cool.

Host 4: Is yeah.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah.

Host 4: That's great. Three thousand hours a month.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Definitely. Okay. I saw I saw a note that you put it about some networking too was small. Maybe? And those were all inbound waves. So not stressing too much about it. Yeah.

Client 2: When you google just shipping coverage Just a heads up, i I know that we're very early on. But route is the first person that comes up. So you know, people that are just generally just surfing the web and maybe looking for some protection. I don't know what it would cost for us to pay on like, a marketing side. But maybe just to get order protection in there. Because if you just go to Google right now, any type in shipping coverage route comes up, so they possibly can be, you know, getting some more inbound leads due to that. But That that's...

Host 4: I just I just Google search shipping coverage and the first one that comes up as Ups capital.

Client 2: Ou ups.

Host 4: On my side. Yeah.

Client 1: No. There your results that you got. Be there's a lot of intelligence and that's the fact that you're searching route. From this competitor. Like they always go top to my page. I I know that got shipping shipping protection probably not as much as, like, until they get a marketing person who sets a larger budget.

Client 3: One things that helps me, what's my website is I just took can put all the keywords that people would type into a search in the background of my page, but I put it like, clear so nobody can see it's there. That makes your stuff good at the top.

Host 4: Right I just created their website too.

Client 2: Yeah. I was looking at it too. They actually have it where you can type in your order value and volume. It'll give you, i, think a brief brief our not brief. But it gives you a ballpark pretty much what your you know, what what it would cost you to go with them Like, I'm on their page right an R calculator?

Client 2: Yep. Exactly. Yep. So right here, this says see what you can save how many orders do you get annually? You know, it says fifteen thousand. Just have a hypothetical cool. What is your average order? Value billed hundred and fifty industry, e commerce store business, then click see your savings.

Client 1: I hello this to listening gear on let's to here up here.

Client 2: And and then it just shows...

Host 4: And they have bone boom listed too.

Client 2: About. What what's that? Bone.

Host 4: Boom is local utah company, but they're not on route either.

Host 4: I don't think no nomadic isn't lie. Either actually.

Client 2: You're right. It actually comes up you Ups or Usps first. And then it goes to route response.

Host 4: Yeah I mean, it's... Yeah. It's right there. So... Yeah. We definitely will We'll be taking some of that real estate. It's funny they rolled out they rolled out their their subscription cost too.

Host 4: You see those on the on the pricing. So they have track, which is free plus the green coverage is two hundred bucks a month. Grow which is just there's nothing to these Right? Like, there's no difference between plus screen plus growing and enterprise at route.

Host 4: Yeah.

Host 4: On on the side said even realize they're charging people to get like user there.

Host 4: No. So we charge you to make money up of you.

Host 4: Yeah. And I what I hear from people still route too is that Now one's no one's adopting the subscription. Alright. It's almost... It's it's tough right because we're we're trying to go down the same route, right, kinda no pun intended. To understand whether or not we wanna do subscription basis on some of these to charge for additional features. Merchants already see how much we're collecting from their customers, protected their order checkout. And it's typically in the thousands of dollars a month. And so it almost feels like double dipping. So I'm curious to see kind what the response is, but Yeah. I don't think the website looks that great. Honestly, I think much better before.

Client 2: Yeah. It's... I think we look very similar though right we kind of duplicated what they're doing from my understanding. Like, if I go to order protection and I go to our website Right.

Client 1: Now Whatever's is on our website right now is like, from what we first kinda launched our new design guy.

Client 1: In karen is is kind renewing a one website.

Client 2: Unless both about they just got relaunch.

Client 1: I saw some of the the schematic design for that looks pretty Pretty slack.

Client 2: Yeah. It's just like how you go down. I mean, all the only thing that Round is doing different least they also have customers that they've helped, like it shows like, Pink lily.

Host 4: Mh.

Client 2: You know, boy, boy jeans, and then I mean, it's typical. Right? I mean, everyone does that.

Host 4: Yeah. Yeah. It's not daniel.

Client 2: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So everyone knows that because Course is our customer on care list this is what I like at.

Host 4: Yeah. Hey, Mark. Can I share my screen really quick. I'll I'll give you guys a.

Host 4: I'll show you what the new upside is gonna look like. Thank you. Let me know if you can see this.

Client 2: Yep.

Host 4: We can see. You guys see the time...

Client 2: Nice. So this is the new one. Right?

Host 4: Yeah. Correct. Yeah.

Client 2: We can't wait through.

Host 4: You'll be able to looks good.

Host 4: Yeah. It's super slick. And i'll I'll kinda show you the differences so they'll have likes of product things here solutions. Solutions is gonna be, like some of our integrations with with some of our tech partners. Which is big. Right You wanna show that pricing, get a demo file lane. And then you can come down here, you can see how much we protected And then we have a claim approval right. I think if you go to route have like, a customer. So here's like their Actually, let's go to Oh, yeah.

Client 2: My guy just accepted for the meeting. So excited. Alright. Let's go.

Host 4: Yeah that one at two today.

Client 2: Yeah. Yep.

Host 4: Yeah. So this right here, right, Like, they've got a customer satisfaction score. But they don't have an approval rate on there because it's quite a bit lower than ours. So we'd like to advertise that.

Client 2: Good to know. I could use that on my calls.

Host 4: Yeah. That's big.

Host 4: Because there...

Client 3: Wonderful this one is Yeah.

Host 4: This one's... And it's it's a lot more So Routes is very like around like their mobile app. Right? And else is very consumer facing like yeah looking stage.

Client 1: To get to the meter then.

Host 4: I just don't like how much like white spaces here. And like, this is nice. Right? Like the Roi Cal is cool.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: That's... I think I think that white space. So that will let a dog better to mobile tune. Which is good to myself.

Client 1: But it like that a good website designer would make it like, so that's it's a bit more dynamic. So that Yeah.

Client 1: It it doesn't look that way on on a regular website, which is what a business what Like we'd be thinking on.

Host 4: Right. And this is cool too. Right? To, like, before route after out. But receives, two customer emails per week. Redirected around to three minutes. Okay. Let me go through ours. So, yeah, We've got some of our featured retailers here. So this is actually gonna be, like, a live video of, like, a woman getting out of her car And you can't see it here, but on on another link that I could probably get from coal woman like it's out of the car, she comes over, like grabs baggage like runs back. So I think that's cool to have. And like, this is just kinda reiterating on the problem. And then four percent of the customers like made negative reviews. This is gonna be a big big aspect of our business. Right? So And if you guys go to route app on Shopify, you'll be able to see how many negative reviews were left. Like, this is this is a big issue just for everyone. Right? Like, if if someone has native experience, they're more likely to leave a review of it's negatives and share that experience? Then they are with a a good experience stat at, you know, a restaurant or a company, or whatever that might be. So our value that we deliver Go ahead.

Client 3: Maybe should have them right less than instead of the symbol Yeah.

Host 4: This is just a mock This is in. The the finished product.

Client 3: Oh.

Client 1: That should that's greater than simple I have a quick question.

Client 2: So obviously, the package has been delivered here. Right? So it's showing that it's been delivered both parties Have received a message that is delivered. Now Right. Is it still on our hands once the package is fully delivered and it's stolen kinda how it's shown in the video here. Would we still reimburse someone after the package has been delivered? Yes. But stolen Okay. Awesome. Now that's a big game changer because a lot of people use Ups, and maybe this may be a little bit helpful for you, Kelly, but like bunch my friends live in San Francisco, and she had a package that was delivered to her front door. And inside her building and so on in the building store stole package and the company as she bought it from was, like, oh, well, it's delivered. So it's not on our hands. And Ups was telling me the same it's delivered So we know that gonna with a job building.

Client 2: Yeah. So I was, like, she was so full of information and, like, for me she had no idea i like, wow. But this is like that's good information for me and what I do. And I was like, oh, so what happened here? She's was like, yeah. So Ups is not you know, there's pretty much told to go pound the sand because it's been delivered. They can't do anything about it. So she lost, I think like three hundred seventy dollars worth of clothes. And she has a room where she could see it and, like, the guy trying to crowds under the ring. It's freaking hilarious. So you could just see like the top of the head. And Amazon won't cover that either.

Client 2: So... Yeah.

Client 1: Exactly.

Client 2: Right so cover that.

Client 1: Sent up They would make them file, they would have made a follow or a police report.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Well, like, like, it's samples so the police are gonna be, like like don't.

Client 2: They're anymore.

Client 2: Yeah. They're gonna it out.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. No. Now.

Client 1: That's the considered to try to, like, discourage them join it.

Client 2: Be honest. Yeah. Exactly. But I think this is maybe something good to I'll share with some of the Aes at the route customers and kinda give them, you know, insight but, hey, you know, this is something that could happen in if you're selling to a lot of, you know, consumers or B to, it's you know, these kind of things happen all the time. And, you know, you don't wanna be reliable for it or maybe just have an unhappy customer because they will just not purchase again. So I just the thing that route doesn't do is they just don't do the wrong item. If I'm correct, Right? So they that's just one thing they pretty much don't do is wrong item. That's, like one of the differentiator I know it's not a big one, but covered international.

Client 2: Oh, oh, international. That's right. Yep.

Host 4: Yeah. No. They actually, let me go back. You guys just screen.

Client 2: If this says good acronym, James. Yeah.

Host 4: Okay. Cool. Let me show you something really fast.

Client 2: And and just really quick widget. Is that just What exactly is it? I'm sorry. I used that on my call and I just wanna make sure I'm using it correctly.

Client 1: So a widget is, like, just like a little, like, you click So when you say, like, Hey there's a widget on your car, Like, when it says order protection check.

Client 1: That's what of which it would be.

Client 2: Oh, okay. I been using it right then I just wanna make sure.

Client 2: Say we'll create the.

Host 4: Have... Yeah. It's just this right here. Sent in okay right below right beneath the order subtotal.

Host 4: Okay. And then...

Client 2: And can we make that their brand and that's an order protection or does it always happen. Water protection.

Host 4: So there's gonna be, like, a a white labeled solution. Where we will basically just this will have their branding and they'll just say, like, powered by order protection Like in really small small font below that. But, yeah, for now, it's just gonna have our branding on it. It's pretty clear to the customer like what they're purchasing.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 4: As opposed to like if we go to... Well, let's go check out one of the the sites here. So now Ro, the way that they've rebranded here is that you know, they don't have any consumer facing material on their website. Previously when when you came to Routes website, was like all consumer facing, like mobile app, everything is like, yeah, this is still showing the mobile app, but it's now route for merchants. And it doesn't look like there's too much consumer facing content anymore.

Client 1: Well, if you go to the name route dot com website, it's consumer facing.

Host 4: Oh, I see what you're saying.

Client 1: I'm still your merchants brown merchants.

Client 1: So you still have to get to that merchant page, like after Oh, I see.

Host 4: Yep. So Okay. Yeah. So this is still baggage protection. Yeah. And so what's crazy is they actually show code epoxy here with it, toggled on. Let's go to their website actually. You said that you guys can get familiarize because I worked with Con epoxy where I... While I was at route quite a bit. We'll see if they actually went to opt out They've always been opt in so routes false advertising, unfortunately. Which I'm sure we've done the same in the past. It's not like we're everyone does.

Host 4: Yeah.

Host 4: Yeah. So see. So it's not pre checked. Right? It's not even a toggle in this case. It's a check. So this is something that they requested. So when I first started route twenty nineteen, this was what it looked like. And c epoxy was one of our first customers. And so mean, it wasn't even, like late... like, branded or anything is literally just a check checkbox box with some writing here. Yeah. And this is the original pop up too. Haven't changed that.

Client 2: And and we found it to be beneficial to just kinda have that box already checked. Right? Because no one wants to see that price go up after a box being checked. It's just some psychologically, Right?

Client 2: Having that box already checked. Just makes more sense for everyone.

Host 4: Well, yeah. And the attachment rate varies substantially. So if this is unchecked, I know Code epoxy only has, like, a one percent attachment rate. So that means one percent of customers are actually coming in and checking this box.

Client 2: Wow.

Host 4: Holy. So if it's pretty... If it's pre, then we'll typically see like, fifty percent on average, like, forty five to fifty fifty percent we do have customers that had higher attachment rates, but That's kinda just lets you know, like, hey, when you guys are selling are you're calling in, like That could be a qualifying question. Like, hey, do you guys plan on Yeah, Obviously, not on the first call, but, you know, once you guys are on the call and if ae aren't are asking about whether or not they want this opt or opt out. Because we have a handful of customers that have it opt in and it sucks. Mean sucks us, We don't see like hardly new revenue from some of those customers. I can give you an example here. Actually, let's just go to O polly. Sorry, Mark. I'm kinda hijacked this.

Client 1: No. No worries. So you could do that me how you go send it over.

Host 4: I say that again.

Client 1: I just wish there's a way to do without us assigning it over because we all sent it.

Host 4: Oh, yeah. So if we add this, you'll see I guess I didn't add to do the cart. Lot of.

Host 4: Here we go.

Client 2: Two ninety five.

Host 4: Wait. That shows opt out.

Client 1: This ten that happened to me too. I was playing around the i'll probably second automatically today. I was an a brave browser. And I tried another bounce. So wonderful she want it to be opted in like right away.

Client 2: May just be a request of Poly.

Host 4: So the biggest concern on their side, on poly side is that customers are gonna reach out to them and complain. So that's the biggest concern. And so are rebuttal to that is if you come into the actual platform, I've got a million tabs open. We have cancel protection button here. So if they wanted to the only way that we can actually do is is three Fulfillment. So as long as this order has not been shipped, Well fulfilled and shipped, and then we can go in and cancel it. Once it's been shipped and that order section can't be refunded. Just just so you guys understand that. But to your point earlier, since you know, I wanted to give you So in terms of the difference from us and route, so what happened, we basically cover all eight types of Shipping issues here, route only covers stolen damaged and tracking now moving. Okay. Me got picture sign know. Well, I can I'll I'll just send this over to you.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. Go alright and write it down I'm my notebook. No. Okay. So there's eight eight number three. I've also realized too is that... Sometimes I lose people, so I've I've cleaned that up. For my first month is was somewhat I think pushing a product. It's like, okay, Well whatever I I you know, I'm not having any wrong items or I'm not having any missing items and so some of them that are that really really matter are you know, like stolen damaged, So what I've tried to do is kinda just listen more and then just kinda bridge that gap for them if they are having any issues. But it's definitely really know that we we we do all aid.

Client 2: So and then differentiate. Right? If they route only use three, I guess, that'd be more frank an Ae phone. Call it. That comes up, but Yeah.

Host 4: Yeah. And I will I'll select this in the sales channel just so that you guys know. Like, I went over this with was on demo yesterday. And You know, obviously, the lady I was talking to, like, so, okay. So there's, like, you know, a handful of different solutions out there, like what makes you guys different like, makes you stand out the most? So having this information readily available is also helpful. Okay.

Client 2: Is this the slide or are we I'm we will we will have this incorporated in the slide, but this is just a mock up of what the new website were.

Host 4: Gonna look like. But the the slide deck gonna pitch like gonna mirror this pretty closely.

Client 2: Okay. Cool.

Host 4: But I just wanted to cover the rest of this really quick. So all all the types of cases covered, like, the reason why this is number one is because this allows us. So when you talk about like, our approval percentage. Our claims percentage. This allows us to approve more claims. Right? Because if more claims all within our our realm, then we're gonna approve them. Right? And if the more that fall outside of routes, lost damage stolen, they just naturally are going to deny more claims. So that hits for a merchant that's like, hey. I'm I'm in because, like, we do have an issue with with with claims, like it's it's, you know, become enough that we're looking for a solution. And it's like, great. Well, you can go with this one that covers these three. But then we cover defective missing items. And they'll typically ask, okay. So if something is... You know, what's the difference between defective and damage is what I was asked on my call yesterday. It's like, well, damage is damaged that's clearly been done by the carrier. So if it's done by a Ups or fedex, they basically say, you know, go pound sand. This is in our fault. You basically have to go back to the store and and file a claim with them. Where defective is could be an issue from the store right so We're using this coffee brand, for example, you might have a package that's completely intact on the outside. But there's a bunch of b, like coffee bean that were still inside the the the inside of, like, the cardboard box that was sent that could be a clear issue like, what a defective item would be.

Client 2: Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. That that that makes a lot of sense. So it's like the carrier damage it or just maybe defective from from the store when it left. Alright. That's that's great. Man. That's That's very valuable for our customers. So definitely gonna throw that into our page. Or not yeah.

Client 2: That Yeah.

Host 4: No. For sure, like, include that, you know it's kinda answer through that.

Host 4: But also like, having like, an legitimate insurance offering. Like you know, I spoke to that, and that was big to the customer as well. And then one we own like, they own their data, so we we only do customer reports based on kit, case types, and then we don't push any additional marketing information on like a mobile application. So I just ordered something from Me pull this up real quick. I just ordered something from a shopify store. I got a confirmation email. I purchased route on my order. From this clothing brand. Let's see if I can So we're able to get pretty much deeper visibility then route or we can provide deeper visibility.

Host 4: Right. Yep. So let me... Here you go. So I got So this is one thing that we do differently as well. Just wanna give you guys some visibility here. So this is route sending me an additional order confirmation email. So this is the one that I get from. The store from shop fighters naturally. I ordered from the Shopify store they sent me. It's like great I purchased route for ninety eight cents. Gears a Hoodie I paid you know, sixty bucks for. And then if I go back, Route is sending me an additional email. So one, i don't necessarily want that. Right? It's a little confusing. To get a whole another email here. But what they're pushing to me here is they want me to download their app. Right? Like, they have two call action buttons. On the first page whereas when it comes to actually resolving an issue or filing claim, It's all the way at the bottom. Right? So one that's telling me they don't prioritize the claims functionality. But then they also want you to file file your claim with a route order number. So if I'm a customer And let me know. Are you guys following along? I'm I'm going kinda fast here.

Client 2: Yeah. No. This is it's it's Crystal clear.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 4: Okay. Let's go to claims dot route dot com. K. So now when I go to file a claim here if I'm the customer, I see order number here in email. The information icon is basically asking me to use my route order number from that shopify com... Or from that confirmation email, they sent me separate of my just traditional shopify confirmation email. So they want me to come back in my email and copy this. And then go in and punched it in here. I can use my order number as well, but it's not as accurate in routes back end. So that causes his issues for their claims team to process my claim, if I don't include this big long route order number. Does that make sense?

Client 2: Yeah. It does it makes it extremely confusing for the customer.

Host 4: Totally.

Client 2: And this was a big issue complicated.

Client 2: Sorry. Not confusing. But it just makes it You have to go the extra mile.

Host 4: Yeah. No. And it is. It is confusing because we had I can't tell you countless number of customers reaching out saying like, hey, I don't know where my route. Order number is, like, why do I need that process my claim?

Host 4: Right. So But here, let's go back to the this confirmation email So first and foremost, right? So I click here. Because I'm on desktop, it's gonna pull me into this. Okay. So now What am I saying? They want me... Okay. What instant an updates put in your phone number and we're gonna send you a link to download our app. Right now, I just wanna track. I just wanna track it. So... Yeah.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 4: Now this is taking me back to the So this is just I don't know if you guys are seeing this. There's not a lot of information here. Right? Like, one, you have, like, this mobile spacing like, thing here and then basically just download our app and then you can track it.

Client 2: That's probably what they want you to do. They're literally just you know, having you follow the dots or follow the trail. The the Crumbs two pretty much download their app And then you're... Are you speaking with a robot then or will you speak with a live member from there.

Host 4: Right. So I just think that in terms of the customer journey, This is a little confusing for me. Right? I'm like, okay. I don't like, hey if I don't wanna download the app, can I just track my order here. It looks like there's some kind of map that's, like blurred out in the background. So this is all information that you guys getting more up to speed and just getting super familiar with what this journey looks like. For our competitors. Is super helpful for you guys to be able to speak more to the problem at hand and actual solution that you guys are are offering to these prospects. Right?

Host 4: So you know.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Makes a lot of sense man that Thanks for sharing that with us.

Client 2: That's very helpful.

Client 3: Our solution for consultant is And then you wanna go through ours.

Host 4: Is that what you're saying?

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 4: Yeah. So ours is simple. I'll just go to So we basically... Let me share my desktop one more time. And I should just purchase, like, something from James Z, but here's Let's go to armor. We'll go to their settings. So I wanna show you this. So customer facing communication So the order protection confirmation message So what you just saw here Now this goes out automatically for route customers. There's no way to basically toggle this off. Within our platform, we have it toggled off by default. And the customer arm actually came in and enabled claim updates via text what I can do if I'm the customer is get updates. So if I'm communicating back and forth with one of our claims agents, So if I come into a claim, We'll go into an open one because then you guys can see some communication here. So if I am Gemma, and I send in this, I submit a claim, and this is the information I sent in. These messages coming from Justine on our support team we... We have the option set doing this over email. These messages can just come over via text. So one, super simple Kelly for the customers just do it all on their phone you know, Ever have to, like, get on their laptop or constantly respond to emails. So we can send that information for them. And then another big difference between us and our competitors is we provide all this communication. So this thread here we give all this access to the brand. So Arm is like, hey. I wanna actually see what order protection is saying to my customers they can come in here and view this information. Whereas route does not have a native platform that they can provide access to. Their customers. So, like, if I am the brand, I'm like, I just got I just got an email from a customer basically saying that you guys denied the claim. You provide more information as to why you denied that? What they have to do is then go reach out to their customer success manager and get screenshots from Zen desk. Then over email to the brand basically explaining why they denied it. That makes sense?

Client 3: No.

Host 4: So it's a really clunky process. But if we go to claims dot or protection dot com, The customer will just put in their order number their email address and click continue. And then from there, this screen pops up. So then those select It was damaged what describes the issue It was... The shipping bag was torn crushed. I'm gonna upload a picture. So i'll upload... Oh, that's my license. I wanna upload that. So say great. Here's a a picture of my order. I'll click continue and then we'll say, hey, is this the one that was defective? If it was the only one in the order, we're gonna pre check it. Could continue and they'll say, hey, We're sorry that this sort of damage, how do you want us to resolve this? So what Route has to do right now is they have to go back and forth with the customer to get this information from the customer. So it's it's a thread back and forth saying great. Hey. Thanks for providing pictures. Do you wanna a refund? Just collect this information within this workflow. So we we don't actually have to communicate with the customer before this point. Everyone, everyone good on that.

Client 2: Yeah. We're good.

Host 4: How how much of this is new information? Do you have email?

Client 1: That this?

Host 4: Cool. So then from here, they're basically gonna say, yeah, I wanna res The reason why this is recommended, this is more beneficial to the merchant. So as you guys get on more customer calls more prospect calls, things like that. You're gonna you're gonna notice that they naturally just wanna reach it because one, they get to record another sale. So that's adding to their top line revenue, and they get to keep that customer. Otherwise, if the customer collects a a refund. They could potentially go to another store, they could go to Amazon. Right? They could A customer... The merchant could basically lose this customer or lose this potential revenue. So then I mean, from like a psychological standpoint from buying behavior, right? like, recommended versus, hey, this is take up to five business days. This is deter me from from wanting a refund. If i'm the consumer. I'd rather just go get what I actually ordered. I'd rather just have them res ship it to me.

Client 2: Yeah. And that's beneficial for the company because now they don't have to reimburse they're getting extra order on their end.

Host 4: Correct. And in both cases the the company doesn't lose money, right? Because we're protecting that that value. So we're actually refund the customer. If they do want the refunds order sections out that refund. But the merchant doesn't get to keep it. Right? So in this case, it's a it's a loose lose situation for order session. Because we're processing claim, we're gonna be paying out the money for it. Whether it's a shipment or an a a refund. But it's more beneficial for the brand for the reshape. So from here, if I'm the customer and I'm like, hey, Let's say this was a stolen order for example, I would actually go in and change the shipping address if I'm the consumer. To basically have it sent to another address. If I'm worried, it's gonna get stolen again. So this is another big one that we do differently the route.

Client 3: In the customer change at any time?

Client 3: Like, if they're like, oh, crap. Even before it comes?

Host 4: No. So if if they don't change it here, then... Yeah. So I mean, like, once it shipped Kelly, you can't It's not like I can call up Ups once it's in shipment, and have them like redirect it to another address.

Client 3: Yeah. I was just... I was wondering if we were that magical.

Host 4: No. It'd be sick for sure. But Definitely can't do that.

Host 4: It's just good I'm.

Client 3: Real time.

Host 4: Yeah. Totally. And I do this on demos. Right? I do this so with brands, and I I'll walk them through, like, what this looks like. And I'll say, my order was damaged. There's skincare product. Right? So this could be a message that you would see. I'd submit the claim, and then I'm gonna signature or put my initials. Right? To basically verify, like, hey I'm not committing fraud. I didn't false the information. And then I'll submit my claim from here. And then what happens on our side is that that claim will then come into the new claims queue. Then our support team, which is twenty four seven. We'll jump on that that claim, and they will actually typically resolve Let me go see what our metrics are. They'll actually go and resolve that claim Let's see. It might be our claims dashboard. Oh, yeah here. I think this is response. I want resolution. Anyways, I'll show you guys what the resolution metrics look like, but they're typically less than an hour. You think about that versus routes resolution times are twenty four hours? Which is still fast. But It's pretty incredible that we can respond and get a resolution in under an hour. Okay.

Client 2: That's. That's thanks for time game changer. That's game.

Client 2: I mean one hour that that's that's mean, yeah. Like you said twenty four hours is impressive, but man to to do it within sixty minutes, that's that's insane.

Host 4: Yeah. It's it's pretty wild. I've never seen anything like it We obviously have a lot less customers route. So we just need to make sure that we maintain that level of support as we we scale, but that's that's the idea behind it. Cool.

Client 2: Thanks for sharing your Tobias talk.

Host 4: Yeah. Of course, man. Mark, Sorry, man.

Client 1: Oh, all.
