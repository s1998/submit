So we're building right we're looking into sales tool in Particular we're looking into diet. And and daily applications. And they believe I found you'll name online on G two, and you will talking about the goal there. So, yeah, I mean, this is really just us looking to little more about f and, you know, what you like, but you don't like how you use it and so on and so forth. Perhaps we can kick it up with... Can you tell us a little bit more about you what do you do? What does your company do?

Client 3: Yes. So basically, we sell paints well pay and I'm just the customer service support and then sales executive. So that what we do. So have this commerce online it's article for our calls, customer calls, etcetera.

Host 1: Right, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. What what does the company do?

Client 3: Yes. So we we sell paint paper. So it's a kinda white product that company office calls they can apply, you know. It's a solutions for for business, So then they can create a new learning space that we what we offer and and the one that I'm I'm responsible for the italian market because By italia, but as well for the other market as well.

Host 1: Got it. And so did you say you will leading support step?

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Customer service and sales. Yeah. Basically.

Host 1: Got it. Let me know that's the sales side of things, but it it's it's quite unusual it's to someone owned both customer service and sales Well...

Client 3: Well, least depends. I mean, it's a small company. Okay. So we are just few people. So that is why we've taken care as well then all the sales part, you know, from the beginning, you know, someone that just contact for informations and then we go go through the sales sample sales. So... Yes... I mean, I'm covered different part on the company. So Right.

Host 1: Great. And how big is the company?

Client 3: Well, we are in fifteen. It's very small.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Client 3: But warranty. Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. And tell me more about Air, How did you find out the value in the fill space?

Client 3: Yes. So basically, before we were using another system, and then we were to find the just a better solution for us because, actually, with the other provider, the calls were very bad. The line was awful, you know, So that's why we try for one month. And then everybody likes it. So we keep going like that.

Host 1: And what what what was the the previous provider?

Client 3: It was blue phase.

Host 1: Blue phase Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think it's famous I don't have idea, but it was different because I call you know that you can install you know, up or your computer, but the other one where it's stolen... There was a physical phone connect to to Internet.

Client 3: I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because before we were in a office, then after them the pandemic remove basically at home. So then we're look for a different solution more... Not most of because the line that we have was was awful. With the blue.

Host 1: Right? Yeah. How how is it going? Well what do you how what do you think of vehicle Well, I have to say that I'm I'm pretty happy because it's it's very useful to use and very easy and very friendly because for example, i used my my phone So I got notifications when I got the call, and I can see who is calling from where and who is taking a call For example, I'm in a team which fu.

Client 3: So somebody took the call, I can see who to be the call. You know? Or if we have any missed course it's easier to see and listen and all the voice message through the app. So we don't have to go somewhere else to check the voice message. We just can see from the app or I can see for example, if there was a call. I can see if one of my coworkers already call back the customer or not, So it's very, very useful. I mean, to have the app or this possible to install as well on the laptop.

Host 1: At me mobile. What do you mean? You you you have a way to have only reached out Exactly exactly.

Client 3: I don't know how to explain, but basically in this application, we are... I mean, Adi area has an account And when we got a call Okay? You can see, for example, there was a call or it was answered by the name of the agent so I can see who took the call who come back everything is tracked. I mean, I can see the be try to call or we can as well transfer the call So for example, my client call but i'm not available. So my colleague to the call, she can transfer to me. So... And everything believe so is everything there? So I can see how many calls my colleague that are doing during the day, for example, it's just from the history.

Host 1: And is that because you old the same number. Or you all have your old number.

Client 3: Well, the things is, yeah, we have the same number. But actually, we have basically six different number I mean, one from is a german line, one italian x set. But when we call, we have the yeah. We call from the same number. But we have a different account. So we can log in with the with different name. But, yeah, we basically share all these numbers.

Host 1: Got it. That makes sense. Can you tell me a bit more about what do you use that goal for?

Client 3: Which tool?

Host 1: What do you... Yeah. What do you?

Client 3: Yes. So basically, for for the for the customers, So if I have to call back a customer or come company or we use as well internally to cause some my... I mean, my colleagues If they are reply on whatsapp, I will control that music see.

Client 3: Yeah. So it's it's mostly for... I mean, for sales calls. Okay. So for customer service.

Host 1: So what kind of things do Customers call you about?

Client 3: Inquire about the product I so that the the brown looks of the call the the call us asking was this this product was the dimensions, so basically or all information about what we offer. Or if they looking for applications most of them or as well I don't know if they need a tracking number of our note that it has been placed but they haven't received So so, yeah, we we used for from sales and customer service calls.

Host 1: I see. Do you Do you ever have like, a question for one of your teammates about one of the calls they just had. Like, you see that they they picked up the phone and they took all Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's happened because for example, as for example, I can add a customer airport. And put the name. Okay. So for example, I know that it's my customer. And I see that my colleague to the call, know, we are always you dodge I i can ask, and I also from the from from the computer, I can see for example that calls was... Was about five minutes ten minutes, you know Yeah.

Client 3: But that's only from the laptop. Because from from the app on the phone, I cannot see how long was the call That's just for... You know just if I'm good about It's not the main phones but.

Host 1: And when you have a question about the specific goal to one of you one of your c kills.

Host 1: How do us understand that question, What kind of apple what's gonna medium.

Client 3: Do you use? Well we we use we use Google Google chats.

Host 1: I see.

Host 1: Yeah What would you think like would it be more convenient if like echo lets you leave internal notes on a given call, like internal comments and questions.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, we have this option actually, but i'm the only one that you it, Interesting.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Now. But there is the option. The only thing now because actually area is connect to Z And is there... I say south not software. But it's the one that we use call our customers Right.

Host 1: Right?

Client 3: Yes. So... Yeah. So if it's to connected. So if I add a note in this call, it should be appear on come and he's even his file. But... Yeah. I mean, I'm the one that I always add some notes because, you know, so don't forget it, but No. No. My my colleagues didn't. So What what what kind of notes do you add there?

Client 3: So basically, if there are Usually if they ask for quotation, for example, they say, look I one quotation for I don't know three kids of our products. Okay? So, usually, I when they are asking something, you know? If I have to to take some action, so I just started there to don't forget or, you know, it it's easy to see. Or... Yeah. If they just ask random questions no. But I mean, the the most important time things I added.

Host 1: I see. And So I i I guess my question was was slightly different. My question was we'll, like if you wanted to to to leave a comment on a specific goal He just one at one of your coworkers skills like, right?

Host 1: Like, at bug, you know, at the, hey, like, what happened during this call?

Client 3: Yeah. No. I i... Yeah and know this I'm thinking I don't think this option is possible I... The one that's... No. I don't that is this option, I guess, no I know I know that they cannot note But I'm not sure if I can tag but I don't think so.

Host 1: Would it be useful if you could? Like, would you would you stop using Google chat to collaborate a vertical, or would you still use a google chat with whatever good reason.

Client 3: Well, it will... We won't stop to use Google charts but if we if there was an shown just add the note and inside look call this customer back. Okay? just add the note and the way to transfer I mean, this did this calls to to my colleague for... I don't know. Maybe like... Oh, call this guy hours and they can have a dashboard with all the notes yeah. I mean it's gonna be helpful. Yeah. Because at the moment we don't have if I if I need something just... Oh look call you back and then can I put the number.

Host 1: What's your favorite thing about? What you like most about it?

Client 3: Oh, Well, I would say that line the quality is skirt, And then i I just slide that I can use from my phone. And I don't need to use a physical on phone or... Yeah. My mostly is the quality of the company the most important thing because before there was customer the were complain and say, I cannot hire you. Or the line was broke Right.

Host 1: No. What do you dislike about?

Client 3: Well these like I hate to know. And I don't know actually. I'm good.

Client 3: I don't know.

Host 1: What would you? What would you like them to change about the product?

Client 3: Well... Well, It could be any any bug that you would like to see fixed any feature that you would like to see implemented Anything whatsoever whatsoever?

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: Option soon to recall the call and at the moment, I think you have to pay more way more and I would like that this option will be in the basic plan.

Host 1: You know you Yeah.

Client 3: No. Because there is the option to code. I don't know. Maybe it's an important call or you just like to send to your colleague, you know? But now I think you have to pay and have a like a training plan to have this option. And I will like that this option will be the basic plan. That don't know if makes sense.

Host 1: Yeah. Absolutely. You currently on the basic plan? Or like on that more expensive plan?

Client 3: The moment, I think we have Not the basic one like conversational plan.

Client 3: I think there are more plan and we are just under the the professional. I'm not sure about the plan they have because I'm know the one that set up everything.

Host 1: So do you so you do currently have recording?

Client 3: We have the option, but we not... I mean, I can see there is the option but we cannot use it. Because we have to have operate upgrade the plan. That's the thing.

Host 1: I see.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: But no so beyond, like, leaving aside the dial air full minute. But all your top problems on the day to day basis you'll work Okay.

Client 3: You mean during my work with my colleagues and the way Any problem, like, what what are the the problems that you would look like Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. What's you get this problem.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I I would say yeah. For the customer service. As we receive many many emails and calls, sometimes so. Now for the calls, for example, I would say, We have missed calls and there is not option to see, for example, if there was a missed call, who has to call back this customer. Okay? It's it's not... I mean, maybe I'm gonna back discuss and the customer gonna say yeah, no. I just received this call if it was easier to see this this customer was already called back I mean, there is no way to see just check the Better things is A think that air can implement actually.

Client 3: To have the option to just take okay. This customer was already called back. Lexi.

Host 1: Like Just signal of that something that.

Client 3: Day, problems about to complain about my customers not much.

Host 1: Okay. Great. I think that's about all the questions I had today. Do you have any other questions Enrique?

Host 2: Yeah. I'm curious. You mentioned to use the mobile app Do you also use the desktop apps?

Client 3: I used before but there was an issue I guess it was connected my because every time I try to adjust a call from my laptop the people can cannot hear me or I cannot hear them. Because I guess the settings every time was messed up. And then you mentioned if you have a meeting at Zoom call meeting, and you gonna see back call from your in your computer, you have to decide or leave immediately the meeting or oh answer to the customer. So It wasn't idea.

Host 2: So you only use your call on their phone now?

Client 3: Yeah. I just... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not. Yeah. Yeah. I saturday because, really, if I have meetings, so if I'm doing something you and I received the the call I mean, if I cannot take it, I have to close the call. I mean i It's it's easier to.

Host 2: Mh. Think You mentioned earlier, is there this feature where you can see who answered a call Sorry Okay.

Host 2: Cool. So Show you the name of your colleague.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can see who took call who call back. Yeah.

Host 2: So for the missed calls then, so Does it show who called back this customer or is that still a problem for you?

Client 3: So basically, as i said, I can see, for example, there was call. Okay. And then I mean, the... If I click there, I just can see... Okay. There was a missed call to see if there was somebody callback this customer i have to scroll up and try to see if this number short up again and somebody has called them, But If I click just in the call, I cannot see if somebody callback back. Okay.

Client 3: Okay. I I have to go back to the key story check all the calls and see if this number was called back again. But from the missed chat from the saturday, the missed call, I cannot see it. Cool. Makes sense.

Host 2: And those are all questions for me.

Host 1: I guess my last question is you mentioned that goal integrates week you'll see our i'm z. What other integrations do you use an?

Client 3: Actually, just with this one I'm thinking. Yeah. Yeah. Now just with this one.

Host 1: I see.

Client 3: Yeah. And actually, now I remember if you if you don't log in on air call in your computer, If you write any notes on on the app. It wants synchronous synchronized. So every time every day, you have to connect to log in on the on the on the laptop on the website, and then it's gonna be synchronized to z. To this. Crm i see.

Host 1: Any any other integration that you wish go had.

Client 3: Well, Well, not really i mean. Maybe from the and I was thinking When we receive an email you know, when there is the the phone number. On Google. I mean, on Google if we have this... If we see the phone number on the signature on the mail, if that was the option that we can click and I'm gonna a call with start instead to copy past on than the that. If this makes sense.

Host 1: Yeah. I think i have a Chrome extension only. That let them do that.

Client 3: They they should, I guess I didn't. I never tried to use it actually.

Host 1: Mh. Alright.

Host 1: Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you so much a really appreciate time today.

Client 3: No problem.

Host 1: Alright. You have a great day rest of your day.
