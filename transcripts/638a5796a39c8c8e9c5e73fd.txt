Host 1: But...

Client 2: Yeah I still get back there often. And Yeah. With midwest. Is best. I do i yeah.

Host 1: Midwest is great. I I lived in San Francisco and a lived you up for a little while, and I was out for, like, maybe six years. So I just got backlash year and see I Yeah. I don't love the cold again. But also, when I came back and like oh my gosh. Everybody is so nice here.

Client 2: Like I out large.

Client 2: So using.

Client 2: Yeah. Very nice. Very nice.

Client 2: Good stuff. Well, thanks for taking the time. I'm excited to see that who recommended the or originally? I forgot. Someone did. Then I had on my notes, and then I came back week because I was ready to start looking at it. So What's helpful for you to learn more about kind of what we're looking for or what's Yeah.

Host 1: So I added checkout for mimi refresh and it looks like you guys are a bit of a hub or a community for startups investors, any basically tech professional there in Florida Miami maybe be more specifically. Also a nonprofit. It looks like Yes.

Client 2: I just came on board about four weeks ago at Coo two scale the organization, clean up everything make everything, you know, optimize make a super efficient. My background is... I'm an entrepreneur I have a technology company. For ten plus years in entrepreneur I started coordinating facing in Chicago two of them sold both of those businesses. I have a technology company called Dust. That gives people access to c spaces around the world, so they of it it's like, literally the Airbnb for quarantine spaces. Or if you're a company you give us at the benefits to your employees so they can book c spaces where they lived. As needed. And so what's crazy is got back from maternity leave of the feet, like, two months ago and was like, oh, my company is doing really well. Everyone's doing really well, and if there was ever a time for me to move on, it would be now. Have business partners in you know, I was chief people officer, so I was focused on all the internal and actually external people operations. So long too short is it was serendipity a good friend of mine runs this organization and with can always try lot of the hire Coo. I just never even thought of it just because I didn't think we can find someone and so I came on board. So my background is in you know, the the tech entrepreneurship.

Client 2: So for me, my goal is to this organization significantly. The great thing about this organization is we have got a hundred fifteen... We have fifteen thousand people that subscribed our email means newsletter we have about three thousand people at our online community, about a hundred and fifteen of those are paying members and they pay us like anywhere from ten dollars a hundred dollars a month, and they don't even use the membership portal that we have. What is amazing is that these numbers know that we deliver consistent technology news that we do events that everybody loves refresh. They just know that this is the organization that supports the tech ecosystem here, but they don't even realize like, what they're paying. They don't know that they have benefits. And one of the... I've been surveying people members over the past weeks. And the number one thing I hear from them besides from they wanna just support us because we do the news is they want to meet they wanna make connections. And I have ten plus years of community building. I wrote a book on how to build an online community. So I'm very familiar with community building and what's interesting is I've used platforms. I have use Orbit but I use platforms like Meet before and I think what our community is needing based on the feedback is the opportunity to meet people, but on their own cadence, and... Yeah. So what my goal is I want to revamp our membership offerings and include one of our membership benefits as these curated introductions based on a set of rules that we would create. So kind of the two things that I'm looking to do And the reason I'm kind of saying all of it is... I'm an operations So I feel like if you have all the info front menu you'll, we'll be on the same page.

Client 2: So two Think That kinda quickly say like, I wanna revamp our membership offerings.

Client 2: I walk this curated introductions would be one of their benefits. But i what I foresee at least from what I've been is like, a lot of people are members just because it's a feel good day want to support us. They may not be looking for introductions now and but they might be interested in general networking. So one question I had was does this provide the opportunity to do, like, general networking events that similar to like, a Zoom with the breakout room, could we have maybe fifty people on a call and then break pick them up intentionally and and if not, that's how it works, you know, I get that. And then for the curated, I wanted to see how it works and see what the what type of rules we can set up, You know, how can we automate it and kind of, like, I wanna leverage technology and automate it, but also have that personal touch of building that community and ability to is that based on needs and number interests and stuff like that. So Yeah. So that's For brianna.

Host 1: Thanks for that really throw overview of two development I'm a they're person.

Host 1: I I I heard... Okay, fifteen thousand people are in your newsletter in about hundred and fifty paid. And then you said there was a a a community, you say three hundred or three thousand about...

Client 2: Three thousand. So that's Thin Jersey. We have, you know, just through mailchimp. We have fifteen thousand five hundred email subscribers. We sent out of newsletter are every week that includes a news, round up jobs and great open rates that. So we have fifty thousand neck. We had to online portal that they're all that. It's like that... It's called body box it's like a Facebook, a social media platform form. Nobody uses it. But when what happens is when they sign up for membership with us. They actually by default have to create a profile. Just a whole other thing I wanna do away with them just having them sign up for the news newsletter. Anyways, they create a profile and then that profile so in that online portal that there's three three hundred members. Nobody is logging into that portal. But then what we have is a hundred and fifteen paying members. So out of those through thirty three hundred members in the portal. What? Three hundred one twenty seventy five r. Free members and then the other you know, one twenty five are paying members. And those people pay either ten dollars a month or a hundred dollars month. The ones that depend on jars a month are doing other things like ability to post jobs and be a featured company so they're typically companies. So a hundred plus people that are paying about a hundred people, because I think a hundred and sixteen people that are paying ten dollars a month. To have access to this portal. Nobody uses it. So really, they just do the ten dollars it's like, hey, we won't we love what you do. Let's support you.

Client 2: Thanks for the journalism.

Host 1: Well, when when you say that you're looking to scale and grow, are you looking to convert more of those community members into paid members. Is that like the the top you to drive revenue?

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I think of course, you know, revenue should always be number one. Because I'm a people course in my goal. It's also just to have like, to increase the value. Right now, luckily, nobody's that with us that they're paying ten dollars if anything like people are just happy... It's like, a feel good drip to them. They're like, oh, I support a good local organization. So that's those upset, but I want them to actually get value and have out of their membership. Now I don't think everyone's gonna use it. So I foresee that says is, like, when people side up or when they look at their member benefits they see that curated introductions are an option and I bet. You know, let me say sixty percent of people will never use it but it's like a nice to know that they have where the other people that actually wanna use it. I want them to actually have their desired outcome which is meet new people whether that's just for general. Not, need to expand their professional network or maybe it's For example, just in a few calls over the past few weeks people have specifically said, I wanna find a c cofounder I'm looking to get funded. I wanna get connected to investors. I'm looking to make new friends, you know, there's so many people moving to miami. They wanna make new friends here that are in the same industry. So yeah. I would say those are the objectives.

Client 2: Okay. Meaningful connections. Right? Like, not just another networking event not another boring zoom like, meaningful connection that actually the end result is that the person i what they're looking for or, you know, makes a good connection.

Host 1: Yeah. Like, like you said when you book a demo basically based around challenges or specific interest and make sure that conversation is high quality.

Client 2: Makes sense. Mh.

Host 1: Yeah. You So it looks like obviously, you have a lot of events that you're doing how much time are you spending doing connections? Is this something you're doing manually at this point are something you want to do of at scale that you're you're not doing right now.

Client 2: Yeah. We're not doing. So the good thing, like, we stopped as an organization, we don't we stopped events during the the pandemic. And now we're starting to do we're gonna do for we're not doing about in our event calendar. Those are all events that are posted by our members. So we just we're a collector of share of information.

Client 2: Right now, the connect what's great is our founder and our executive director, the two of them together, no. Everybody in Miami and miami tech. And so somebody's looking to get connected, I mean, one of our assets I say is our those people we... I just run it by them too. I'm like, hey. So I looking for this, and it's, like, you know, they spit it out like a machine matching matching pairs but they aren't always available. And also, we want numbers to have this ability on their own, which is like why which just why i like, the idea of then being matched based on their specified needs and interest. But I do... I I would love this to be like, I don't like to compare. Right, But I'm just gonna... I've used N before and I was in a people ops community. And so I was familiar with their platform and what I liked about it is like, I think it was once a month. I read an email that said, oh, you've been this person and then I can go and increase or decrease that frequency I can look at their linkedin, profile in advance. And I felt like I was in control if I want because for for my back community building and hosting events and things like that, like, I always noticed that eat for them even the most well spoken extroverted people when they're at a table with ten people that never met. They clam up. And no... Even myself like, I've been in so many events, like, it's still awkward go up to a group of people that you don't know and be like Hi. I My name is So So I can I join your conversation? Like, people just want that. That first like, being extended and what I like about platforms like this is like when I got that email from Me let and what they would say, you know, you've been matched, which means okay. Now it takes away... Like, I know that we have a shared interest. It gives me opportunity to put my time. That person doesn't wanna meet with me. Alright. So be it, Like, no harm file there. But if we both, like, we both the way like, dating apps, like, in essence, there's they're phenomenal. Right, allows to meet people, but it if keep... Both people are actually using it, like, they intentionally to, like, let's they get married then it works phenomenally. So that's, like the This exact use case there.

Host 1: Yeah. It sounds like... I mean, I'm very familiar with me see and obviously, we we know them. We know a couple other people that are are doing similar things think orbit is is much more robust. And I think, you know, I know they have a profile so they're actually managing members in there as a way to.

Host 1: And right that's something out orbit completely does away with.

Client 2: So...

Host 1: Yep I think there's a lot of good synergies here.

Host 1: Even with these group breakouts that you're talking about may with that something that that we could implement, but I think it's good. I'll I'll show you through a bit of a product demo and walk you through what else like member perspective, I'll show you what's like, to admin that And, yeah, see how this how the schedule him.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah. And you mentioned that, you know, Mit has that number directorate I'm struggling with is like, I don't wanna take too many things to like, even though I I left that no one's using this online portal. I'm wondering, do we keep the portal and drive people to it? Or do we get away what we do we remove that? But if we remove that, I I don't wanna drive them to another site or like, drive them. And but also, like, maybe you don't even need a member directory at all. Because right now, we should leverage where people are getting their information from us and I think personally, like, if I could just my fingers, I'd say, let's have mailchimp trip only and send people like it's segments our user base and we know exactly what their interests are. Keep them segmented in Mailchimp, only send them email communication, and then in those emails we can links to like, an orbit match orbit networking event.

Client 2: And then no more, like, online portal, those are signing on to multiple places. But I'll stop there. Because you said that there was no like, member profile. So that really was interesting to me.

Host 1: There there are so many platforms out there. Right. There's a lot of places that you, your... Everyone already has like a a Facebook or instagram.

Host 1: That they're engaging with you. And, yeah, it means you the they platform form. And so if you do Slack... Are you mentioned on Slack or anything like that or discord they have a slack and, like, there's like three thousand plus people in it, but nobody uses them.

Client 2: So it's like, again, like, it it I think person from a community output that's worse when you go in... It's like going to a party and, like, no one's talking. Or like, is weird, You know, like Good.

Client 2: Not a good thing.

Host 1: You have Slack, You have Linkedin groups. Like, and they pushed out activities. Like, it just goes down. It it will never go back up once it comes out on And that that's a common problem we have with a lot of clients to using forums on Slack and so this is...

Host 1: Yes. So... yeah. Good good to know you're feeling feeling that on your end.

Host 1: Yeah. I'll I'll share my screen with you and I'll just walk you through a little bit this stuff fifteen minutes left our chat properly take, you know, the whole thing, but you have a hard stop.

Client 2: No. Let's let's give it a whirl and just go from there, but no.

Client 2: I I definitely am excited for the demo. For me, I like to see it and k.

Host 1: Alright. Awesome. So can you see my screen here it's blue review Okay. So what I'll do is again, walk you through the member experience. A little bit similar to what you're talking about with Me a lot of differentiation. And again, I'll just share the actual portal with you from a community manager perspective, not from the member.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: So really high level So Orbit, we are obviously, an Ai engine, but we're making these one to one in these group connections as scale our big thing here is reducing your time, managing a community and making these connections and plugging them into whatever other objectives that you have. So revenue or network we wanna make sure that those are the results that you're getting. Three big things that we do. One is we have really good matching criteria. So we're matching members based on interest challenges, roles, We ask them for name and email because we send them a calendar invite. But really basic information that we know results in a very strong match. The second thing is frictionless sign up so there's no profile There's no login. We're just a tool for you to use and engage wherever they are. We don't want another platform for you to manage your members on. And they don't necessarily want that either.

Host 1: Mh. It's third thing is automated scheduling. So once they fill up this fifteen thirty second opt form automatically schedule them and mash them up with somebody. Really seamless way to connect, and then it gives you a lot of feedback based on topics, time zones even though, you know, I'm sure they're all in Florida at this point, but topics, how often they want be connected? Even other events that they want to meet up so they're interested in more round table. They're interested in these these breakout groups, that is something we know we can offer them later on. Couple of companies that were working with, we released started with Vcs. So connected founders, investors, portfolio companies, we work sequoia capital first round n fx Vc platform is a really big partner of ours. That is a very for very big first use case for us. We're always bringing on new Vcs for founders in their portfolios. We started expanding into customer communities for, like, demand generation like Nikita. They're using us with their unpaid community and they're trying to get more people into a paid customer. Spend desk and left corner, they're Cfo group about four thousand paid members. And they're using this exact like you mentioned It's a value ad for the paid members they get to increase their membership fees, more people are finding values so it increases. I think they went from four thousand to six thousand. Since we set a work with him. And then developer communities. So atlas last seen, we just started from working with their four million developers really big long term thing we're starting to to discover with them So just some good names. Basically all of our mean using site partners. So They're are client vars, they're Vc, they connect investors, founders and a portfolio. Pretty similar to you because you're connecting this type of community. First thing that the members received, just give me an email op in. Right? So we wanna engage an an email, really high conversion rate as your branding your colors your logo. They're not engaging with Orbit, they're engaging with with you. So really quick text about how it works, next steps you're gonna set a date to opt in by and then it date where they're gonna get mashed up. They don't opt in that first email they get a really quick second reminder a couple days later. It was they do opt in And that is all those emails that's an option of feature within orbit to set up.

Client 2: Or is this a recommendation that insight that... This is what insight did.

Host 1: This is something I'm using inside and like but this is an option for every client that comes on.

Host 1: And It is an option everything is customized customizable well, you don't have to use these emails. So you can get, like, an evergreen link and stick it in newsletter like mentioned.

Host 1: Yeah. Okay. So if they click on the email or if they click in from, like your newsletter or whatever else, they could take get taken into this form. So, again, your branding your logo, they're engagement at this point, and everything is customizable.

Host 1: So we ask him first name email for that calendar invitation, We can toggle on linkedin, so we can plug that into the calendar invite once they give us that information that we don't have to.

Host 1: Areas of interest role years of experience. Industry, time zones really basic information that we know is gonna result in high quality meat. All this stuff our Cs team works with you develop the best questions to ask to ensure you have a good match rating. Fifteen seconds they get some confetti and then that's it. Twenty four hours r Oh, yeah. It does its thing. And they get a matching through email. So here's your partner, here's some information about them. And then they get a calendar invitation at the same time. So right into their calendar, we can put answers to the questions in the form. So they have that to prep, we can add a conversation guide. Everything that they need to have a really good conversation and in no work. On the end essentially.

Client 2: And it's matched use of ai go work, but it's nash based on their questions only or they pulling in other things?

Host 1: So it... It's a pretty robust weighted scoring system and how our data scientists are in these things up, but we're always trying to improve the matches based on be based on a lot of different things that we true. So you can wait the role or years of experience over the areas of interest or you can different areas of interest or industry more so than other things.

Host 1: I think once we have... We've an hour onboarding session, it's a full thirty days client.

Host 1: We determine the best way to increase that engagement in, like a blue engagement.

Host 1: Does that make sense?

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. So it's interesting. So we would work with us to determine what those kind of metrics or things are and then Yeah, I guess I'd wanna know more about, like, that setup process.

Client 2: Interesting.

Host 1: It's really simple, really user friendly. And you mentioned that, you know, people are asking about fundraising, or they just wanna do that?

Host 1: Or maybe they're interested in customer acquisition or they wanna meet with people that are in Series a like they are, or they wanna other yeah.

Host 1: We use all of these things to match up the right people. If you send it to, let's say, your community of, like, three thousand people right now versus your between fifteen thousand your newsletter, we're gonna use a bit different parameters based on getting the right people engaged.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: Interesting.

Client 2: I'll show you.

Client 2: Do you will you show anything about onboarding process or like a okay Cool.

Client 2: I know I am. I get excited.

Host 1: I'm not gonna go, like, super in vic because definitely really onboarding takes, but I'll give you nothing information where, you know, you know exactly what's going on there.

Client 2: And then there's, like, I assume the dashboard that an admin would use and...

Host 1: Okay. Yep. Yep. Know right after this, I'll get right to it. So From a member perspective, the last little part that they have here after they get that calendar invitation. They get taken into a branded video platform. I'm not sure if this is something meets he does or do they have their own branding platform their a video platform as well?

Client 2: Yeah. I don't know.

Host 1: I I I I've checked out a lot of different because I'm confusing it there was like a survey option in a different one but no.

Client 2: I don't know.

Client 2: This is very friendly. I've gotten, like, thirty waves already.

Host 1: Yeah. Our Cs team put this together in So we built this in house. It's it's encrypted. It's meant to provide more of a seamless experience for them. So they can open it in the browser on their mobile, their desktop, super easy. If they wanna replace it with their Zoom or Google Hangouts, can do that. A big deal.

Client 2: Very cool. Very friendly and I get Last step in the process for the member is a feedback form.

Host 1: So they're gonna get right after that match happened. Did did it happen to not happen?

Client 2: Bit of a?

Host 1: No shows. We ask him how strong was that match.

Host 1: Ask him one to five. How strong was this conversation? How good was this match for you?

Host 1: Are average outreach across tens and tens of thousands of four point five. So people use they typically really like us. We what our topics you wanna discuss in the future What's the what's the frequency? All that good stuff very simple. And and that's it nothing more from a member perspective.

Client 2: I feel like we do this in real life. Like, if you go on, like, a coffee date somebody or you're I feel like, we would all be better off. We just... We're honest about like, about what it exactly?

Host 1: Yeah. That would be great.

Client 2: I I could tell like, a bad joke here, like, it off, you know like I mean, if people talked about everything that they did and then actually gave feedback, I think both parties probably find the next time or enjoyable.

Host 1: Is long as long as it's it's an option and not Yeah.

Host 1: Requirement i think is absolute.

Client 2: Right? Right, Of course. No. And.

Host 1: Okay. So Chance your a question on the criteria for the questions. This is what that portal Sorry. It's not a portal. It's it's an admin dashboard. So I don't wanna confused that we have a member portal because we don't don't engage with us.

Host 1: Is simply you would manage this stuff. So typically, probably eighty percent of the time. Our clients are uploading like, a Cs of their members their community, and then work emails for them.

Host 1: But they're creating those emails. So it is it's not an It's not a mailchimp, but it it has that feature.

Client 2: The other twenty five sticking in their newsletter.

Host 1: So you create audiences here and you can send it to every audience or choose audiences to create engagements for, and then you can manage or specifically.

Client 2: We uploaded it to create the audiences. Do you do any, like, surveying capability to create additional audiences or we would have to upload it and say, like, this... These people are in marketing. Just wondering, i'm trying to figure out you, how do we segment our user database now to find out no interest.

Host 1: We don't need to segment it before you upload them. The only thing that we need is their first name in their email. Honestly, if you got your first name last name email, and any other information that you have, let's put it in here, but when they fill out those forms to opt into an engagement, it's automatically gonna update, and then you can download that and upload.

Client 2: That.

Host 1: Okay. Upgrade your your Crm or anything like that that...

Client 2: So for example, like, when they opt in, they can say, at this point in time, I'm a series a founder looking for this or this, and then it would create an audience for them here, and then you're saying we would obviously have that tag and then we can... like, export that and use said. We need that somewhere else.

Host 1: Yeah. They would. So you could manage every member's responses and information here.

Client 2: Something they...

Host 1: Okay. When gonna say? If they like, update their profile?

Host 1: Yeah. They update the role or a company or their company stage, that information is gonna be here for you can add tags you can move around audiences or segment by the specific answers that they give.

Host 1: Mh.

Host 1: And we can then create engagements. Or even create engagements around like, I wanna be matched on a weekly basis instead of a monthly and you have like.

Host 1: Let's create segment for them. Create them on a monthly basis, and everyone else will do a monthly engagement because we're gonna give them the engagement that they want.

Client 2: Gonna miss.

Host 1: On this information. So a lot of ways to improve that. One thing Is this referrals here? So if you're gonna send this in your newsletter, even if you send it in our email, it's one forwards that email to a friend, and then they opt in, they're automatically gonna be in this referral. So if not already in our database, this is where they get they get tagged.

Client 2: Mh.

Host 1: So that's another good way to segment people and is there a way to limit it where only people who like, so, obviously, we don't want non members to be able to join this.

Client 2: How would you, like, you would do it by email.

Client 2: Like, we were we would obviously have to update like, upload all of our current from members say these three thousand people can use its platform. And no one else can or... Okay.

Host 1: We we can... You either say in email only typically don't want do that. We just want anyone to opt in. But if we have, let's say, ten referrals In this engagement, we can choose not to include those ten referrals in this engagement and save them for a next one if you want to. So we do... We can recommend matches before even schedule those matches, if that makes sense.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. But we can also make sure that nobody who's not a paying member. Can get, like can use this can get matched.

Host 1: Correct.

Client 2: Correct.

Host 1: Okay. They still... If they get forwarded the email, they still might be able to opt in, although I think we can toggle, the opt form if they're not already recognized as a member, They don't get on So two ways we can do it.

Host 1: You still can get the opt in, just not match them or just not let them up at all.

Client 2: Okay. Yep. Yeah. It's not a big concern. I don't think.

Host 1: Yeah. Okay. I'll show you an engagement in terms of what this setup looks like. I'll just choose one that we're doing demos Course sarah on. So this is what it looks like to set up So you're gonna choose your audience maybe you wanna do every single person in there or just a specific specific group, let's say you just wanna connect founders. And you didn't segment themselves. We don't wanna segment, let's say, i we wanna connect Series a founders connect all founders and let them determine where they want fall line that way. So we can set up the registration date if you wanna set the opt in by next Thursday, and it'll get next day.

Host 1: This is where you do that. And then we create a topic. So we have a library of topics that i fill in the conversation guide.

Client 2: The template email, but you can modify this stuff.

Host 1: That the first email, the subject line, the button, Even though reminder email, everything here is customizable for you.

Client 2: And.

Host 1: So those are in here. The most important part of this, and you can decide not to use this email, but you can use this text for your own newsletter if you want to. The big thing is that form. So when they click that opt, obviously, that very first text is is customizable. But we're gonna ask him some very basic information about them. There is a or company that named their email, we can toggle on or off that link in Your. We don't have to ask that. We didn't have to ask them to rule in the company for if we want to. And then the match question is based on interest. All of this is customizable. So we can add in these things like fundraising customer acquisition. I just wanna do networking you know, basically segment themselves by that topic of interest.

Host 1: Yours experience is is a big one. We... That's a big reason that our match are so high is because experience level is typically something that people wanna connect based on. Company size is another one. An even company stage. So series be our dc loved to use this one, but we don't have to use this stuff. And then you can add a custom question. So depending on essentially the tier that we have you on one to seven questions we can add in here. Usually, the more targeted of the audience, the more questions makes sense to ask them.

Client 2: Okay. And what about it Is there an opportunity where, like, let's say, the first, you know, because, like, what I foresee is, okay, once you figure out what we're gonna do.

Client 2: We're gonna send an email to all of our members and say, hey, here's the new look of refresh. Here's all of the different benefits to capitalize on this first benefit which is curated introductions fill up this form and let you to feel that out and it asks them for questions. Right? Like, what industry are you in? What are you looking for? Like let's say four questions. And they fill up that profile and then maybe down the road, we wanna ask additional questions. Can we then go back and send them additional emails and then it will revise their up, like, update their profile accordingly.

Host 1: Yes. Yes. So this is one engagement let's say you're gonna do two engagements per month with every single member So they're gonna... Gonna ask this information. They're gonna get matched the next engagement, let's say in two or three weeks, they're gonna get the same form and they're gonna update their answers based on what they're interested in, Their times, anything like that, and then that will update in their profile. Alright. Alright. Right.

Client 2: I am not the rude person on earth. I so sorry.

Client 2: Thank you just understood are you okay do you have, like, time the chat.

Host 1: Yeah. If if you do I figured something you having with the conference room or something like that.

Client 2: No joke. My computer straight up died. I've been on call all day long, and I'm actually using like husband's airpods because I'd mine are done for the day. I on so many calls. And I didn't realize that my computer was, like... It went out. And I was like, oh, my god. My computer just broke. And then I was like, oh, no. I haven't charged my computer like, three hours.

Host 1: It did... It's happened to me a few times so...

Client 2: About a Friday, It's a Monday. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was, like, this person probably thinks i'm rude as person her. Says still awful.

Host 1: I'm so sorry.

Host 1: You good.

Client 2: I was like I was so in the demo.

Host 1: Yeah. Well, I mean, I know I know I know much time you have looked on this but, yeah, Totally fine. But I mean, happy to answering questions that you have. I know we kinda cut off of the matching questions.

Host 1: We also board with analytics. I can show what the doubt looks like.

Client 2: Sure some of my questions like, just you know, like, the questions that I have like, what kind of analytics? I already saw it like like, when we invite them and, like, do integrate with mailchimp or anything. I... But I don't feel like we need to, because you have know capability Yeah.

Host 1: So I'll just quickly through the dashboard. We do have integrations as well. Let me show you a finished engagement. So your members because anytime they you import a Csv or they give us feedback all this stuff is updated, and we can send that to your Crm. And We integrate with most Crm out there.

Host 1: Okay. We don't integrate with Es fees like mail or anything like that, but we can download reports. You can you can get that data wherever you want to through a Cs taken expert.

Host 1: That that is one thing. Dashboard. So this is per engagement.

Client 2: We're out a new version called insights in q one, but really basic right now.

Host 1: So this audience size was about five hundred. And then you can see that about a thirty percent opt rate we can look at the total N s, the average rating, which is quite high. You can see what types of people were actually meeting up the topics that were discussing time zones. Obviously maybe it's interesting for you. Are you work with anyone the community of Florida.

Client 2: Eventually know mostly. But it would be it this is still helpful it's still nice.

Host 1: Yeah. And then any feedback question that you asked. So what topics are they interested in discussing or we can say, which the frequency you wanna meet up monthly is typically winning The week and then you can add in things. Do you want group matching. Do you want these breakout sessions and we can do group matching and not just one one. We do about groups of four to nine right now. So if you invite, let's say three thousand your community members, we're gonna break them up into so many groups of nine people and we have those connections that way.

Client 2: That's another option. So instead of just one on one, you could do largely group of Okay.

Host 1: Yep Yep. Exactly. So a lot of ways the slice of the data any custom question you add in there, will also give you analytics on Okay. Let me see questions.

Client 2: So can you talk me through the pricing and how that would work? Based on because the worry that I have is we have three thousand members, but only a hundred of them or so are paid. I want working like, not everyone's gonna use it. Right? Like... And I like it. So when do we get hit as a how do we get charged? Is it once they opt in? Or people we upload we have fixed pricing annually and you do to ten thousand member invites per month.

Host 1: So I I think you're far even if you get up your email list, a few times a month, you're not gonna exceed our rate.

Host 1: It's fixed.

Client 2: So you said fix freezing annual and up to ten thousand opt.

Host 1: Up to ten thousand invites.

Host 1: So Okay. So you have fifteen thousand So let's say you invited your entire newsletter at fifteen thousand. I can just increase it from ten thousand to fifteen thousand. You can do that once per month. Probably what you want to do but is maybe invite less than ten thousand people yeah.

Host 1: Your most engaged people and do it a couple times.

Client 2: That's probably or, you know, your community of three thousand, you can do that multiple times in good and that's ten thousand nights per month.

Host 1: Per month.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: So our pricing is it's in three tiers under that ten thousand like at last scene like they're way up an enterprise beyond ten thousand. But at this level, you get one to and matching you get group matching as well as you go up we just share this with you so you can look at because I'm looking I know it's on your your website.

Client 2: I think we just kinda quickly talk through that.

Host 1: We start at five thousand annually the basics. I would say most of let's the Vcs and the portfolio companies that are founders, investors, they're at that essentials tier.

Host 1: We go to fifteen k annually, and you get group matching you get more matching criteria if you get more rounds per month you more things with your data.

Host 1: So one thing that Pro has for instance, with this top recommended match is, not don't know if this that you would actually use, but just to describe what this is, is we can match up people before you make an introduction and we can recommend So here is say your paid members of hundred and fifty people We can mash them up and say here are all the people that you are the best people to match them up with, and then you can use that for, like an in person event. Or you can facilitate some kind of conversation on your own or we can edit those matches we can just the invites.

Host 1: So a lot of different things we do with the matching.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Interesting. The real quick. Sales. I was it Oak. Would you be able to send me a list of that types of what type of analytics you I do have, like, the name of the reports that you can run in there just so I can because sometimes when I go through the process, I wanna know like, what kind of information we're collecting. I wanna know what what we're collecting from each thing that we're using, basically.

Host 1: Yeah. What do you mean by that?

Client 2: Like, tell me, like, what reports can we generate through? Or is what I wanna know. Even if you just send me a list like... Because I like just the header of the reports that you showed me.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Sure. I can see... The name of them.

Host 1: I can send you maybe a screenshot, let's say, I'll send you overview deck. As in for this.

Client 2: But like for instance, This is this is perfect.

Host 1: Yes. Screenshots of the things that you can look at.

Client 2: Yeah. You're gonna send me this deck.

Host 1: Right? I'll send you this deck, and then you can actually I'm not gonna sure the downloads, but you can download this up into, like, a pdf or Csv then use whatever you want.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. No. Just seeing that it's helpful that's all I need. I just wanna see and and I'll include pricing in here as well.

Host 1: So you have the uber experience, the admin, the pricing Yeah.

Client 2: And then... Oh, yeah. I remember last question the onboarding process. You said it takes a few weeks or how does can you walk me through that look what that looks like.

Host 1: We love to work with you in onboarding it takes thirty days, we typically run at least one engagement, maybe two within that thirty days. Then we get a lot of feedback, and we say, okay, this is where we wanna start engaging for the rest of the year.

Client 2: Usually you run one or two engagements like you help us to run one or two or reading do like, test one.

Host 1: It it depends. Some people like to tested. Some people like just to run a first engagement with all their paid members right away.

Client 2: So Okay.

Host 1: What you wanna do we will walk you through a bit more in training on this setup, talk about questions and some logic that we can use, and then actually run first engagement and then get feedback, and then maybe run another one within the first thirty days.

Host 1: So all of that is pretty hands on and then, you know, let's say become an annual contract. We're gonna work with you hands on pretty much that time. You're never kind of a loan using this product.

Client 2: Got it. Oh, nice. Okay. So that So our annual contract would include the onboarding kind of like this white glove. Setup up process. And then we would have, like, an account manager that we can turn to.

Host 1: Yep. Exactly. Okay.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 2: In terms... Are there any other questions that people typically ask that I that I didn't that might be helpful or No.

Host 1: No. Those are the big ones. I think timeline, like, when would this if this is something that you all find valuable to make these connections that you're wanting. When would be like an implementation day?

Client 2: I mean, I would ideally, we would start this, like, start sending out introductions in mid January. I'm working in the next two weeks like, before the holidays hit, I want i'm refining our strategy, and I wanna say, okay. Like I said, I'm working on all the different verticals. So I'm figuring out what we're gonna use and how it's all gonna work together. But Merry goal is before the holidays. To know what software we're gonna go with and start setting that up and then ideally, like, by mid January end of January be dot send out at least one engagement that invites members to start utilizing their benefits.

Client 2: Yeah. That works.

Host 1: Yeah. Q... For start of q one, I would say if you're gonna have, like a of like, hey, goals for next year, December would make sense. But start first in January mid January. Makes total sense.

Client 2: I if we wanted to, like, email all of our members let's say second can make a january and be like, hey. Here's what we're doing this year. Big changes. One of the big biggest change as you now have this benefit click here to opt in and start setting up your profile and start getting matched other members. If we wanted to do that, like, let's say, second week of January or third. What we'd have to work backwards. Right? And that's probably, like, meaning that we should start. Mid December because you said takes about thirty days.

Host 1: If if you wanna do your first engagement, let's say mid January second or third week, we could start first week of January with a onboarding, could start like the contract date in January and just ward from there.

Host 1: That that's like we don't... We would just need to basically note logistics in December, I'll send you this overview deck send you a couple of good case studies yes.

Host 1: I'll send you a standard service agreement as well just so you have that Yeah.

Host 1: Is there a particular... Are you more leaning in towards like this essential or the pro, like, what features would work for you?

Client 2: I right now, I... The essentials also or oh, the essentials. For now. We're a profit, you up for nonprofit discount?

Client 2: Save it.

Host 1: Yeah. You ask that a couple times. So we work with a handful of nonprofit. And right now, they're all the essential of five k.

Host 1: Mh. If you all did wanna move forward here in December, I could... I could wait for onboarding fee so you get an extra five hundred dollars off. And if you wanted to engage your full newsletter beyond the ten thousand, I could maybe do value add an add and add an extra five thousand per month.

Host 1: Of number invites.

Client 2: I think Yeah we wouldn't we wouldn't do it for the whole music Newsletter the reason is is be want this is only gonna be a feature for our paid members. So right now that's only a hundred. But we want an email actually to think about actually, if you think about it, we would only be emailing the paid members now. And then one once existing people in our database upgrade. Yeah. So really, actually, we're not emailing them many people. So it would be more helpful to from a budget perspective. I I've never been in a nonprofit situation. So it's a weird add. This would, like, if there is any wiggle of room on just, like, the annual contract just because The budget stuff is a thing. Maybe you think about it. And or Let me know how to make it work.

Host 1: I what what makes sense? Would it be like, spreading out the payments and instead of annually and doing like, a quarterly basis, like what think something like that would be more helpful.

Client 2: Because right now, you're saying it's an up at cost.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. I think spreading it out, what also. So be helpful just because just with the nature of my role. I'm gonna be scaling the organization as well as the revenue. And so Okay.

Client 2: Having to pay for everything up front, it's like, okay.

Client 2: Yeah I I know we're gonna grow, but it's like, okay. that probably is gonna happen. The chunk of it will probably come in q two q three, two four.

Client 2: I do my job well. Right?

Host 1: I'll happy to work with you on that and and start somewhere can scale and grow with you as as you do, like, for sure that. Let me let me go and have a chat to see if I can get special approved pricing and then and then just get back to you and see what makes sense.

Client 2: Yeah. That's helpful. And in the meantime, yeah, whenever you have a second send over everything, thinking about all this out over the weekend, But it was really helpful to see the demo. I love it it's funny At first, I was, like, leaning towards, like oh maybe they have... Like I like that you don't have the member directory. I like that. It's branded to us. I like that it looks like it's our distributed match making service because like, ultimately, that's that's like it's essence. That's what we need. We just need the ability for members to be matched. Based on certain rules and to connect and we're that connector. Right? But ultimately, like, self, they can do this. And it looks very nice and clean. So If I have questions I'll let you know, but no this is super helpful. And I can sorry.

Client 2: Just leave in the film of the meeting sort yeah like a worries.

Host 1: Glad I I'll just send this up to you.

Host 1: Yeah. Any questions let me know but I'll I'll reconnect after the weekend no matter what Awesome.

Client 2: Thanks so much. Yeah. Enjoy the weekend.

Host 1: Alright. Thanks for
