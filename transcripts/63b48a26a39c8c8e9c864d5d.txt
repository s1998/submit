Host 1: Gotta, like, going and research what's going on with the order too. So it takes longer. How about you, Brian? What'd you get?

Client 8: I got this awesome sweatshirt that says pretty good dad.

Client 8: It's a little bit of an inside joke.

Client 8: There's a newer, like, Pixar movie. And as part of it, he gets like, a bug that says pretty good dad. And I've laughed out loud because everyone wants to try to be like, a perfect parent or perfect whatever, and it just doesn't happen. Like, the more kid did you have you they get the more like all that tension and stuff comes out. And so you have to not try to be perfect anymore does have to settle for just being good. So when I got the pretty good data, I just thought that was perfect because that's about as good as I can go for anymore.

Client 4: Solid.

Host 1: We have a pretty even rip mix there of, like, half half ads half non on this call.

Host 2: Just how many moms? Just Nora? On this call, Kinda only one on this call?

Client 8: We yeah there other products basically have almost like nano particle silver in it So anti bacterial antenna pro do all sorts of different things with healing the body and stuff like that, but they have a bunch different products. Should be really interesting. I think they're gonna go pretty big. But... yeah, my wife connected do a lot of bigger brands in Utah especially those that are in by other women. It's a pretty amazing network of women supporting women. And so she's kinda getting set up to be able to introduce us to these different brands and and get us out there. Think it's gonna be pretty good.

Host 1: Cool. And like nora husband, Frodo. He does... He dead back in the day the was the name of that company?

Client 6: Secret.

Host 1: Secret yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. It because those dead sea that east stuff yep.

Client 6: It's really good.

Host 1: That's This asana was really nice it's called star pull. Everything in Switzerland is, like, super well manufactured. That's crazy. I I mean, they make all the watches. Right? So I guess they're good it was made.

Host 1: Yeah. The doors are crazy. You can turn the door handles like up. And you can pull the door out slightly. To like that errand. Oh first first I thought I was like taking the door off the hinges for for a second.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 11: Asia picking at websites over the break, I stood up a Mag magenta server.

Client 8: That we can use for our own testing. I just put a link and chat. Just have some sample date that baked in, but we're we're trying to get it orders flowing into our our stage environment, so we can test. Once that happens, maybe everybody can go in place a few orders. We can get some orders flying into our test system so we can go through Well, I like the messenger bag.

Host 1: Yeah. What your let's go? But as i saw you messaging them the, like, the data is not coming into the back end or something.

Client 8: Yeah. Nothing's coming in, even with big daddy that was going into their environment, we literally just had them update the Api works and links. So instead it go into the Matt you know stage environments coming to ours and it's not going. It's not coming in. So hopefully, we're gonna figure that out today.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, these guys are on the hook to deliver something that's the were I think we should definitely have a Zoom code with them. We paid a fortune to them, obviously, So Yep.

Client 8: Yeah. We can't get things working today with some of the steps they send us overnight, then we'll be on a Zoom at tomorrow, going through stuff.

Host 1: Awesome. Have we've been trying to get that thing live since center or started? Yep.

Client 8: And painful.

Host 2: They signed in August, I mean, they weren't ready to go till what November, I think.

Client 10: Yeah.

Host 2: And they switched Have the...

Host 1: Maybe we're gonna have to get, like, updated agreement or something, because it's been a lot of months into that year.

Host 2: Yes, Seriously.

Client 6: Is there a statement of work? Are they and breach of that or No.

Host 1: We just... We sign it before we have them gentle integration working and even supposed to have it done in like, a month and it's been a couple of months.

Host 1: But hopefully, hopefully, it's finally I get implemented? You you think we'll be able to go live with them this week?

Client 8: I hope so. I think it's possible yeah. By the end of the week. I think once it gets flow, it'll get flowing and mike really quick. Gonna figure out why it's not hidden.

Host 1: Is depending on their schedule to hopefully hopefully that guy is back Yeah.

Client 8: Yeah. Has he's been really of the last week or so, we've kinda gone back and forth chatting about things. So I think once it's working, we get it in our production environment. Test it out quick. It should be good.

Host 1: Awesome. Yeah. I mean, it's gonna also wanna us start going all these Magenta sites, so I'll begin. Of just having to go after job five.

Client 8: And by the way, our integration with Big commerce we believe is done. We're just waiting to find somebody who's ready to test it with us. And same with gorgeous and smarter actually wrapped to the point we're ready to go live with Armrest. So like, this week, I think is our goal week with a lot of these new platforms and integrations So Topper and team, if you can help us kinda get people lined up and let them know that we'd love to have him do validation testing with us and get moving on it.

Host 1: Let's go that's good to hear.

Client 12: Ken. I'll reach back out to to aaron today and and see where he's at. I reach out to him over the the holiday and and wish them a happy holiday didn't hear back. So see three response.

Host 2: K. Cool. I'm reaching out to thank care me hair. Who said that they didn't wanna go live couldn't But we also we also shouldn't tell them like that there are first you know, customer on the platform, and Don't think.

Client 12: We told them a little while ago that the the big commerce integration was live before the holidays. So we just... We didn't get a signature yet we're waiting on that. So you turn kinda upped the the rev here that that we were offering. So Just waiting on the response right now. And so i'll reach back out to him call phone number.

Client 13: We tried to light Target. I guess like our Ic. I got, we had that. Like is there any conversation there you?

Client 13: Yes ma'am.

Host 1: Shop Shopify Shopify website. Do more than five hundred orders a month? Alright. Right now. And they don't have a huge Air, I guess.

Client 13: That don't have one.

Host 1: Yeah. Because it's the ball... you if the order volume is too low and the Ao the is too high. I see that's a like we we we're putting deals into closed loss for that reason.

Client 12: Right.

Host 1: Also, like, wholesale our websites.

Client 12: It just what make sense. But there's a lot things that I've had that have six hundred orders a month, but their ao b is under a hundred hundred dollars. So they don't wanna do anything bigger than a one nine five and that has not being like a ten k deal.

Client 12: Fifty seven, like a seven k deal with the touch rates.

Host 1: Right. Yeah. It's pretty low.

Client 12: So I'm trying to... I I think if we can find a little bit more alignment on, like, what accounts we wanna go for. That was a big part of the discussions. Going into the new year. You know, targeting and going through our Ict. Think if we hop on a couple of calls to to finalize a alignment on that, that probably be smart.

Host 1: I think ideally in be, like, sixty k plus but we're just having to get these deals coming in. Like got it's that we're cold calling them or they're Finding us, but Yeah. I mean, it's we have to manage their business for a year. Right? So there's cost that go into that.

Client 12: A lot of these are from cold calls. Because Mark was having the Sdr ramp up. And it was something that we said we were gonna then kinda transition from it into the new Year.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 13: Because a lot of them really don't make I don't wanna say. Make sense, but it's kinda tough. Because it's, like there's certain accounts. A we would like to go after is to the business.

Client 13: But we need to be aligned with Mark. And the Str sdr to effectively strategically the after of these accounts off like because i bring more revenue and and That'll make more sense. Us to find like, what our Ic is. Especially if we keep it like that sixty k and above the number, I think that we can do something like that, and we could kill it. But we just need, like, set a play plan to get it, like what's the game plan.

Client 12: Right. And then at what levels do we offer more of a register there? If we can kind of have like, a tiered aspect where it's like, accounts that are this big. Can offer more of a register because obviously, there's a little bit more wiggle room. And if we can just, you know, have an idea. I've been able to get an idea in my head and I've been able to doing, but this alignment across the org or creating some documentation along those lines. I think it'd be really helpful for everyone. Just on the organization's side of things.

Host 1: And I think Tara is gonna be working on that. I mean you also have to portray the value of, you know, the customer service aspect of it. The twenty four seven staff and things like that, like, when you're if the... If the only value exam is rev share, that's probably not a good sign. Like, I know that it helps by increasing that because it's more and money back to them, but you know, there is value in the software and the managed service and and other things. So there's, you know, flexibility to increase it if it's a huge brand, obviously, but wanna, like, try to drive home other points too, not just the rev.

Client 13: So to that point then, and I don't know if Nor would be the one answer this question, like, the agreements that we currently have with our customers, are we able to get some type of, like don't know. Like, one pager with like, like, dose Roses writing in say order protection helped us do a b c. Right? That way we can go to all the flower shops and say, hey, We actually have someone that's in your space. Because I think it's more credible when we're able to have content that we can send in people a lot of times, I get these brands on the phone, and they asked, like, what's the... What's the top five brands that you're working with. Better in my space. And you know, I can name them, and they're, like, can you send me something and I'm like, no. I can't. But I can show you their website. We kinda lose... We lose a lot of credibility there. That's been my a bit difficult part about, like, keeping these deals on the hook I don't feel like we have enough content to share with them. Of our current customer base. Does that make sense?

Client 6: Yeah. That that's definitely what I've seen at previous companies as case studies. So I have an our agreement that we're allowed to use. Now we have to be careful Which customers names we use because some people will red line out that portion, Topper, correct me if I'm wrong. I haven't seen anyone yet red line out the provision where we're not you know, a lot... The publicity provision where we use their name. So as long as that's in there, we can use that customer name, but usually, what marketing team does is put together a case again they'll put together all the people in that industry and have them put testimonies together and you can send that out to customers. Again, I'm legal, I'm not in marketing but in my previous companies, i reviewed those and edited those and have those sent out to customers. So But that would... Yeah. That's that's on our end. So we're gonna communicate with them get touch from them, put it into a one pager and then we can send those out. So I have seen those to be really powerful for sure.

Client 3: Yeah. And I'm know just, Malik and I had a huge library from where we came from and it was you know, my go to all the time. One thing that I started working on when I left was, videos actually explaining it recap like and videos like need kinda talking about case studies or you know, showing footage of that company's just having them do a quick interview or something like that would be really fun to kinda get creative and how different ways to outreach.

Host 1: Yeah. I think I think video like, recorded videos be really good talking about like the Kpis we wanna go over for a brand. I mean, like, it's it's just a matter of going and and doing it. We haven't done it yet. Like, primitive skate. We know the president of affirmative. We can always reach out to to him to get a case study. But we just... We're haven't done it yet. So we just got a pull. Like, maybe rachel can help pull some data and put one together. But, yeah. There's there's definitely like, customers that are willing to do it.

Client 12: You know, just some compelling evidence that helps them understand these are the numbers that we're getting from these specific brands because right now, we just have, like, numbers on the deck. That's all that they see. I don't see anything else. You know.

Host 1: Mh. I think we're gonna be... We're gonna be updating the analytics tab pretty soon with the new version that Rachel worked on, so that'll that'll be nice always we can get a couple metrics on each account, and and then they can log in and see not new clients, but like, existing clients can log in and and see their their analytics. And then we can probably use that to, you know, add to a case study.

Client 14: Yeah. And there actually is sales team. If you go in the sales folder in Meta base. Where we have our internal merchant dashboard that we've been using for a couple months now. There's also a merchant facing dashboard there. Which is a really good tool to use that, like, you can be showing that too customers if it's their data, obviously. But, like, if you're talking to existing customers, That's a really good place to direct them to until we get our analytics temp updated, but And if you don't have access to Meta, let me know, and I can add you Yes please give me access to Meta Rachel.

Client 14: You don't have access.

Client 12: I don't think so. Asked on a little while back, but I'm not sure i we got.

Client 14: It's Jericho's.

Client 9: Hello sent that over. But Who's getting.

Client 12: No. You might have you might have honestly I haven't checked. So it's possible.

Client 12: So too.

Client 12: I was like, let's double check.

Client 3: Can I get access as well? Thank you.

Client 14: Mh.

Host 1: Yeah. I heard on the wildfire case it's called the, guy kind of said, like, the their current claims process was not very good and that He felt like it was fit, like, from a process perspective. So that that was absolutely interesting Yeah.

Host 1: Like, of asking the customer like, oh, how do you guys... you know, how do you guys file claims now and, like, what's the current process? And then you if they start talking about how like, oh, it's not a very good system right now, oh we don't really have a good process then Like that helps some kinda start thinking about how this can improve it.

Client 12: Right. And speaking of, actually, just hopped off the phone with him before I hop on this call. He wanted to know because the president's main problem is the level of permissions that we need He said most of their applications don't need that high level permissions. He was like since it's to simple implementation, only two lines in Json code. Can they just install it themselves?

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 12: Okay. For sure, I'm gonna I'm gonna send that documentation over to them then. And they said that they're gonna be live but they new my site. By end of week, so most likely, they'll just implement it into the new code.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 9: Believe do you know what questions there they have an issue with? We type He didn't say specifically what permissions he just said about high the level of permissions.

Client 9: I just say is depending on what permissions he's worried about. The the solution that you just described might not work because, like, there's certain provisions that we need either way even if they implement it. So... yeah. I would just I would find out what their issues are, and then and then know We might we might wanna just do it on a Zoom call?

Host 1: Drawn. Like, he can do it. Like, their team can do it on their screen. He'll just share the screen and we'll walk them through it. Like, we don't need The access. He just needs to generate the private app.

Client 12: Well so that's what would make ten feel comfortable.

Client 12: What he told me. If we could hop on a call.

Host 1: Is it what You're making at are our Yeah. Like, we should get our developers on a call with them. They can do it on their own computers. And then we'll you know, get an implement, like, on the call, basically way.

Client 9: Totally. I agree. If if the issue... The permission issue is specific be with the the themes, then that will solve it, but like Topper had a prospect it was saying something like, oh, I don't wanna give you access to orders. For example, and that just won't work at all. Because that's how our app works. So that's why I say anything think they think of it as the orders on front end like the shopify front end, they don't think about the private app.

Host 1: Okay. I think we're just just get our developers on the call and say, hey, we'll we'll do it on your screen. You guys can go and generate everything We'll get it installed, then they'll feel, you know, comfortable. What that is and instead of giving us the access request.

Client 9: Yeah. Cool. Okay. Yeah. Still.

Client 12: Yeah Yeah. That's probably best bet. Let's see, Alex, there their logistics manager over there. He told me that their president would are less comfortable Well.

Host 1: Yeah We can do that.

Host 2: Just Have just do have a call right now? Or did they know?

Client 13: No. I think they they actually can't so couple days in ago so. I got off there. Got call. So busy day.

Host 1: Awesome. Yeah. Let's get... Let's get that schedule in malik link. I definitely wanna get them live. I think that's a easy way to do it. We we should be able to just get them live, like, in the same also. So maybe we try to do it like Monday. If they're gonna go live with their new site on Friday.

Client 12: I have an onboarding call with them on Tuesday. I already scheduled. Said he'd like to hop on that one. Know it's someone else that was included on the email. As far as implementation goes, so I'm gonna reach out to her. She if she wants to hop on a team. I mean, hop on with our implementation team. Just get that live. Okay because she said if i just not to attempt.

Client 12: Say that again?

Host 1: No Tuesday at the tenth.

Client 12: Yeah. Tuesday.

Host 1: Okay. I thought it was today.

Client 12: Was today. He just called me right before this call when he says know, gave me all the I gave.

Host 1: Okay. Awesome. I wanted me do it on that. Call Sounds good.

Client 12: And then as far as the magenta integration goes we have and I think a going live call with them on Thursday. What should I reach back out to them and say we're not ready yet? How how should we handle that? So we still hop on that call and let him know that we can begin testing. I think it's begin testing. That's what the call is for.

Host 1: With eye pressure, Oh that pressure correct?

Host 1: Don't know what do anything, Brian? Me Yeah.

Client 8: Right now, let's not cancel or give any alarm yet. Let's see how things look twenty four hours from now. And they go from there, we'll know in a day if we're gonna be good do not, I think Sounds good.

Client 13: I have a question really quick June. I've talk to Topper about this. But I just wanna know, like, from this like system standpoint. What should we tell customers that are, like, way too big for us right now? But they are interested in, like you know, order protection.

Host 1: Who's the customer that's way too bang for us right now?

Client 13: Well. I mean, There's this a website called K. And their sneaker website. And they're pretty big they get like a lot of orders and they, you know, but they have a lot of claims like almost like fashion level. Type, you know, when it comes to sneakers.

Host 1: National never gets a lot of glam so they what they So it was like, you know...

Client 13: Because I mean, reports pirates sneakers is like a big thing. So, you know, talking to he was he was down for it. But I was like when he told me how many claims he gets. Like, they're like, yeah, we... We get a lot of claims. I me couldn't even tell the number he was like He's like, it's it's over a thousand a month and I was outside. I was like, I don't know, like, what criteria we can be like. Yeah. We can add all that. Versus i'll call back a little bit. Does that make sense?

Host 1: That's only thirty two a day. So I'm we're gonna we're gonna definitely do that or at least get into conversations with them, you know, if needed to add more Cs people handle claim volume, then we can pretty easily do that, but I don't... Like, thirty two claims a day is not a huge volume. So like, feel free to let me in into those type deals. I can help help you scope it out. Cool.

Host 1: Because we we definitely have a lot more staff in right now for claims then is needed. Like, we have twenty four seven staff or the claim solving that we have now. Which is Yeah. They they definitely have a lot of bandwidth right now to handle more. So Cool. Yeah. We're actually paying a lot for claim to handle it for these brands.

Client 13: So.

Host 1: Yeah. But as we have more volume, you know, it's it's fine. To typically, I think an agent can do about twelve claims an hour. I like a normal speed. So if you're on, you know, shift for even one hour shift, you can do ninety six claims a day, and that's one person. I think we have, like, three people on every shift right now. So we're we're way under volume. Even that even that volume right there would be fine. Cool As we grow, do you expect us...

Client 12: I mean, do you expect that we're gonna hire more for that team or are we gonna kind of prioritize accounts and make that like a a a premium feature where it's like, if you want your claims or on the two and under an hour. That's more premium, maybe less of a rev share, whatever maybe and then other other accounts will be like twenty four hours.

Host 1: Mh We've been talking about that within the last, like, couple weeks actually, the Sla time. I don't know. Because you know, with something with some things, you just expect it to be Like, yeah know. If you have an insurance, you expect to answer quickly. So I'm I'm curious like, can we upsell it or not? Like, obviously, faster is better and and, yeah, you could say, like, you know, this this tier you have a twenty four hour response time. And this tier you have an hour response time and the the hour response i was more expensive, but have to kinda play around with it. Because like I said, just like some sometimes features are expected. Right? Like, if you buy at Tv, you expect it to have a remote.

Host 1: Right. I can look like, oh, if you wanna buy the remote, that's an extra I don't know. Yeah. It's a something we've we've definitely been talking about over the past couple of weeks is like building specific features and to maybe, like, two different bundles. Right.

Client 12: No. I think you're right though, like, certain features are expected. And and one of these is, you know, handling claims at at a quick rate. So But as fast as possible making sure that your customers are handled. So yeah. I I think maybe staying with the under an hour response time does this work.

Host 1: We're can definitely get some good customer quotes related to speed. Like, we were on a call with Arm other than she was like, as I was writing back to the customer that we couldn't do res i meant you guys did a shipment and approve the claim in, like, four minutes.

Client 12: So that's a great quote.

Client 12: Something like that on, like, a testimonial should be great.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm i'm definitely gonna end up Arm and primitive for some quotes.

Client 12: What do? I don't think I've seen the website.

Host 1: Care.

Client 12: Okay.

Client 12: There's a lot.

Host 1: Think they do the most volume right now.

Client 9: They're actually It's a like a drink... Like, the that here familiar with that.

Client 9: Sure. Been drinking it recently loves it.

Client 12: Lost, I'm not familiar you mean...

Client 6: You mean collagen?

Client 9: No.

Host 1: No.

Host 2: Flo is...

Client 6: Lot like milk.

Client 9: Yeah.

Client 8: Yeah. Actually they've taken all that good to that concept they get it from cows.

Client 8: That's what Our sells.

Client 12: What?

Client 13: Just got the right thing.

Host 2: You need inflation an order for the office?

Client 12: This is crazy.

Host 1: There assessment reviews.

Client 8: We arm staff. It's, like cold following and it almost sounds like they're writing their own reviews, but, like, It's it's all over the Internet. It's crazy.

Client 6: How much.

Client 8: Love it.

Host 1: Wanna do a that stuff.

Host 2: That's why Yeah.

Client 12: Close that.

Client 9: That they, like help like both there's people claiming they help with, like, pretty much anything you could think of they're, like, Hard changed my life with this thing. It's crazy.

Client 6: I mean, they call it liquid old.

Host 2: Sounds like something I would be interested in, honestly.

Client 6: I'm interested. I'm about to order.

Client 8: I I just bought my first like, canister of it, like, there'd be one to try it out.

Client 8: So if anyone wants to buy it, I can get you a fifteen percent off code that's better than on their website.

Host 2: It kinda reminds me that quote from the office when do dwight like, talks about absorbing the other fe is in the womb, and he's like, now think I've got the the strength of a full grown man and of in infant or like...

Host 2: What I think about I'm like, man. If I start, taking this stuff. So I'm gonna be Anyways, yeah.

Host 1: Sorry i thought it was a care coming.

Host 2: So I just...

Client 9: That's the reason i correct I didn't want salesman little to bit, like, on the phone. Like, oh, yeah. You're care. Let me show you the site and it's.

Client 12: I I definitely would have done that.

Host 1: And they could call Cole and I definitely gonna use them in the beauty beauty and skincare. Industry on the side.

Client 8: Well, here you you you kinda laugh the that, but people talk about one of the benefits being their skin kept like healthier and point when they get this in them, like stomach, repairing their guts, like, their micro who food beverage like poop, like a poop product.

Client 8: Like something like that.

Client 6: Good Colon. Do you put a your coffee? Or just the water?

Client 8: Know, you... It has to be in a cooler liquid?

Client 6: Right a new in it.

Client 8: Like, one of the ladies that works at Arm. I was talking to her on in Slack she just dumps it in her mouth. She said it kinda taste like creamer. But any kind any cold liquid works.

Host 2: She's dry and it, like, pre workout.

Client 13: Yeah. Good no.

Host 1: Okay. I do a lot of volume.

Host 2: Julien board they're great customer.

Client 13: Alright.

Client 8: Yep. By the way, our smarter integration allows us to protect subscription orders and they're, like one of our primary things, Like, there's a lot of subscriptions going through armrest. So once we, it could boost our our profit with them pretty big.

Host 2: Definitely will.

Host 1: Gotta see how you opt into it there like, if I have an existing subscription order, how I add order protection.

Client 8: What happens is you get an email on your order placed that says, hey, you're your order is not protected. And there's a link you can click on that adds it now every time your subscription order goes through you get another email that says, your orders protected.

Host 2: Got a quick question.

Host 2: It's yeah it's a...

Client 8: And by way, it's not like deal yet. Like, right now the way we had to do it is whenever, like, the subscription order places we have to manually place the order protection order. There's an unpublished Api that smarter has that would allow us to bundle things together. So you can say, there's an option that's, you know, the product and order protection one thing so that when the order goes through, it's all done at once. But they've got have an engineer, get us the details And so they were booked the end of the last year. So I'm hoping in the next week, we can get that pulled in and it'll be even cleaner than it is today.

Host 1: Yeah. Manual Doesn't sound good. So one another question? I gotta a hop one second by the way.

Host 2: And this might just be for for everyone to sake, especially on the sales side, but how are we tagging res shipments and Shopify? It like a prefix or anything that we we use. I know that's in the notes section, but I had a call had a demo with a coffee company yesterday. And I don't know how we specifically do it here.

Client 9: Yeah.

Host 1: Definitely in the notes.

Client 9: It's in the So if I were to go and filter my orders, Jericho, you might have the best answer this, Sergio Harrison.

Host 2: Is there way that I could just pull res shipments from from order protection.

Client 9: Yep. Yeah. It'll have a tag in the tag section like, I think it's Op reorder. Op p dash reorder something like that. I can I, look at it real quick right now. So you can just use the... Yeah yeah, if they're asking, specifically you can go into the the orders page and then tags that have, like, o p dash reorder, I think it is.

Client 10: Yeah. It's not I actually don't see the tag.

Host 1: Jericho. I'm might looking that i one here.

Client 10: You can take out one one has the tag We've been doing a lot of those lately.

Client 7: So to know, It'd be tagged width and then order session Jericho.

Host 2: Or what is it I know it changed a couple times.

Client 9: What is it now?

Client 10: This says o p dash res So with the selected value be?

Host 2: Look tagged with if I'm filtering.

Host 2: Okay.

Host 1: Oh, here it is. I was looking at the original order. Yeah. It's o p dash reorder. You can just go into Shopify and filter on tags and then type that in. That sense? Yeah I'm on...

Host 2: I'm on it right now. I'm in Polly order page and then if I filter by tagged with and then selected value is O p dash reorder.

Host 2: Is that what you're saying?

Host 1: Tagged with them.

Host 2: Yeah. Let me... That's what I was doing. Let's see. There we go.

Host 1: I just did it on copper for all at worked.

Host 2: Yeah. I just did not know poly worked.

Client 9: You go what be...

Host 2: So search you can't just filter like o p and then nothing nothing will show up it's gotta be op dash reorder. And then is it... Same goes for refunds? Lp dash refund.

Client 10: I don't think there is a tag for refunds.

Host 1: Yeah. Because it would be on the original order. Yeah.

Host 2: Oh, that's right.

Host 1: I guess we can add to the original order?

Host 2: No. I think this is exactly... At least for the I mean, that their biggest question. I just didn't know what we filtering by because I tried filtering while i was on the call and I thought it would just auto like, give me an option if I were to search it like Op or order protection? Cool.

Host 1: Oh, I gotta a jump guys, but Can i see everyone? I know we went over longer today. But And Kelly, our meetings are usually a lot more formal formalized than this. So this is the an informal one.

Client 3: That's great. I like it. Cool.

Host 2: So you guys.

Host 1: Nice guys.

Client 4: I
