Host 2: Yeah. Yeah. Same here. Awesome. Well, thanks for taking the time and I mix a team here, brandon Is Tech leader that the race is team. I think he all meant to Enrique who's a product manager the team. He was, like, like, walking his through Cell ai. So, yeah, we'd love to onboard you today. So you're round the context is, basically, we're looking for, like frankly, it's a better. Right? So it's it's a bit trough around the... It's still pretty awesome. It's still deals we we the onboarding people if you did it. I just want start with that disclaimer. Our intention is frankly, we're looking for if it Right? So we are looking for brittle honest to be feedback of people who, like not meeting their well. So feel free to, like know, shoot me... You know, I will be touch by email. I left I do to slack as well. Feel free to like send me your thought. You all thoughts out the product, would you like don't like what direction direction you would like to take and and so on and two forth. How does that time?

Client 4: Sounds good.

Host 2: Awesome. So summarize the product for you today. Right now it does two things. One of that is It uses Ai to automatically update your crm So it it it connects to your meetings to join so meetings. You can see it here. It says meeting audio. So that's that's what it is. That's number one. Number two, since we records the meeting and transcribe it We also show you your meeting recordings. So you have a page where you can see your meeting history and then are with Gong.

Client 4: I've used gong. Yeah. We don't use gong good today at this this one, but I've you.

Host 2: So very seemingly a bit better. And cheaper. Right now we'll free, I think know once we charge, he will be like, half as expensive as gone. And we... Yeah. So you can see all teams. You can see the transcript You can see how much time is bed talking, and it will go you tell you like, hey That we recommend you do these, i'll that be. How's does that sound?

Client 4: Sounds good.

Host 2: Right? Which just make curiosity, which of these two value props is resonating with you most right now.

Client 4: Well, I mean, for this organization, we're not you know, both actually really help because we're not doing either yet. The ability to update Salesforce definitely exceeds you know, helps reduce time and workflow. Primarily, But even just being able to transcribe and get the the meetings that we're we're talking about, that can be quite technical sometimes will be super valuable. And what we're doing... And just being able to share those even across the team is value.

Host 2: Yeah. So you can share those with the team and you can also share that with the client, the customer. Like, if you go go a lot, that's stuff being like, hey. It's zero thing we talked out, Still like an Ai did him and sullivan it and so forth. Awesome. So can you go ahead and show your screen and I will go ahead and send you the second plane here. In the chat. You to with you if i my screen. Well, I guess, it's slowly recording in the way.

Host 2: Thank you. Okay. So do you use Google or Microsoft?

Client 4: But this one will use Microsoft.

Host 2: Got. You guys. You can feel free to go ahead and... Yeah. So we... Exactly we connect to your calendar order to join your sales meeting I'm sorry. I do writing. Can you can you bring the app just pin on what you do what's your does.

Client 4: Yeah. So airline metrics is an analytical tool for the travel industry specifically for travel agencies airlines and corporates that have travel programs. What we do is we track all of the air specific data flown in revenue you know, say for example, when you buy a ticket, you buy a ticket, but you don't use it right away. Right? It's not used to later. So tracking that ticket from the time of purchased till the time it's used, We give insights for those different groups. To what's happening within their airline revenue and we tracked those against their targets. So they... They're giving sales targets for that they need to hit in order to get incentives and playback back and things like that. So we track those contracts for them they always know where they stand and then we forecast that information so that they know where they'll be. Even though They're not there yet. So sometimes it's three months before you actually use a ticket that you purchased. So you need to know where you're actually setting.

Host 2: That makes sense. And and and How is the company in your your team. What do you do there?

Client 4: Yeah. So I am there chief commercial officer.

Client 4: Chief commercial officer, so basically, chief revenue officer same thing.

Client 4: Manage marketing in sales.

You tell me which fields you want us to keep up to date player? And and and you walk me through, like, what each of these skills means for you? It you'll load the fields for minute. How many fields do you have? That's an unusually long?

Client 4: Not that really. We we keep it pretty simple one this one. So it's Feels that we don't have a ton of them.

Host 2: Brandon and On andres is that berg on side Looks like it's still this might be a new right click on the page keys and do inspect.

Host 2: On the at the bottom. Yep. And click on the console, the control tab. No. There... Yeah. Sure. That's a bug. Any chance we can hot with hut.

You because this should be on our side. like I said, you know, it's it's a new product. Let us let us take a quick look at it right now, like it it's happened before that we like, fix a back during a call. We call perhaps to, like, jump back on the call together.

Client 4: Yeah. No. No worries. Or if you wanna skip past this part of it, we can That's the last call.

Host 2: There's nothing after done. And that's the meat of the meeting actually. That's like No.

Host 1: I recommend going past, like, this... If we can just You could probably try to disconnect it and then go back. If you want to the page?

Client 4: No.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 4: That's still gonna go.

Host 1: We might have to be disconnects you on.

Host 2: If it doesn't go through. I don't think this met p either. Brendan Well, it's like an authorization there.

Host 1: That's what i'm saying. It's like, there's Oh, not necessarily on our so side I think, Like that's why why I'm wondering like, if we just disconnect and try to reconnect it, that's like...

Host 2: Yeah. What's the name of that page again? Is like slash integrations or something?

Host 1: Slash integrations...

Host 2: Can you replace set up by integrations in this link?

Host 3: Let let me let me update it that base. So like any settings.
