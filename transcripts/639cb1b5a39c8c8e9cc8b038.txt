Client 1: Alright. Yeah, getting the party started love the turnout. This is awesome. Well, lots of faces. Thank you all for joining us. On Friday I'm sure if any of you are, like, My calendar look this week. It's been intense as everyone is trying to condense everything into this week before the holidays. So thanks for taking some time to to level up. We'll make sure we pack as much value as we can into the next hour and I know we've got the right guy to do it. I am joined by my good friend, Tom Pic, Tom welcome, brother.

Client 2: Hey. Good to be here. It's crm see some familiar faces here ready. So it's good to see.

Client 1: I love it. Love it. Paul, thanks for setting this up. And again, if this is your first time joining one of our Sessions do these monthly. And, you know, we try and bring on one of our Lps who is an expert and of a hyper specific part of go to market, Tom is an incredible enterprise sales leader. I'll go into his background a little bit. But Yeah. These are always for you. They're four founders than their executive team. So We wanna make this as interactive as possible. So The floor is literally yours. In that ideal world I I just shut up and let tell is things and you guys can ask questions.

Client 1: So if you feel comfortable, just unmute yourself, ask a question as we go through it. We've got some stuff planned, but truly interrupt me anytime. Or if you feel more comfortable, throwing a question in chat, you can do that as well. Again, these can be as specific to your business as possible and, you know, time that will do our best to to wrestle with them. And you can always connect with Tom after. I know he's super open. To health and portfolio companies.

Client 1: So that all being said, so Tom is the Sv of sales at global data. Also the founder and Coo o of top one percent or sales academy, has a podcast, it's incredible. I would go check it out. He is lp in Gt fund. He also founded Sdr defenders, which is cool. He's a Pavilion ambassador? Another great community if you're not part of Pavilion, definitely go check that out. And your go to market adviser for multiple start you know, beyond just our our portfolio. Did I do that justice? What am I missing man? Do you wanna give a little bit more context with color any your background?

Client 2: Sounds like a lot. We say that way. But I think I think mainly from my, like, Well because, like where my sweet spot as as you can imagine spinning go to market. Strategy. So I've always leading revenue teams. It's been an emphasis on new logo positions. You know, and that's kind of particularly bit in mid market and enterprise levels. There, I mean, top one percent are we train salespeople and disco to to close or selling past the sale that's mid market enterprise reps. From there, and that's from all walks that start through know, Salesforce. Senior enterprise people that have come through. You know, but to give you some some context a, a global data, what I joined, I've taken my division from one to seventy million over the past few years. Here as a company. I was i joined pre Ipo back in two thousand twelve currently publicly listed on London. Do it about the engine mill pounds Arr. So it's... It saves a wide breath. Of experience, but for me one of the areas that I see that differs from some of the other sales leaders that I work with they're learn from is I've had a bit... Career that's been focused on vertical. Specific selling, not a specific vertical. But it's varied from, you know, oil and gas, defense and government, pharma, financial and professional services probably sold into and lead teams that sold into. About nine or ten specific industries, which I think brings a a very focus then know kinda living in just a pure, like, selling to salespeople worlds? So hopefully, I can help and and answer different questions, different varieties to you guys and yeah, looking forward. So thank you. Thank you for having. Me take time.

Client 1: Thanks for spending the time ma'am. And excited to dive into it. Quickly just something you said there, which is, you know, you've always kind been industry specific. Do you think that is necessary for when you're selling into these large organizations. Do you need to have a hyper specialized team industry specific team.

Client 2: I think it's, you know, it's relative to product sets. Of course, Right, But I do think so you're breaking down any large enterprise organization. I mean, the Soogrim, we're were talking before people came in about Sap. Right. Yeah. So I have team, like I'll have individuals that will go into sap in the go to their specific group. So having a subject matter. Better expertise to go into their, you know, defense contracting. Group their, you know, health, their power their, you know, tech, having that level of expertise so you could speak with these know leaders of the particular divisions. It expedite the process. Immensely. I believe, You know, it's... you know, I think to be successful in I mean, annie cell. Rather it's mid market or enterprise, Smb even, like, to be know subject matter expert, particularly within your Ic p's. Even more so than the industry. Understanding what they do where they live what they're judged on where other roles are measured for success and and kind of the aspirations and tied to the role. Where your product or solution you know, kind of fits into that. Is ent. For success. So I do think having you know, industry specific rather than just being agnostic will help you penetrate accounts deeper But like, some of my team i have set up. It's almost like I kinda I use a terrible analogy. So maybe... Maybe you guys tell me it's better, but it's like I have... you know, it's almost like my my lead on the account, my... Senior strategic you know, a enterprise a for you know, some of these larger know, multi vertical organizations. Have an expertise one sector. So that's kind of their their way in. So they can beach at in there. But then they'll go into their golf bag for depending on who they need for which specific industry. So it's like, okay. Know, devi away from their area of expertise. They'll bring in the know, the driver. To handle the this, and that could be our, you know, lead analyst or maybe another salesperson that has more experience working with clients in that sector? And then yes, so they they almost become a bit of like they go from the player to the Cad. In some aspects where it's a. You know, you're you're orchestrating the right people to come in. But we you're doing, you know, true enterprise deals. And trying to go upstream, you can fake it. With some of these industry experts at the levels, because you're not gonna you not to be able to tie to their true, like, the business solutions and the needs that they have, You're i gonna be able to get deep enough and sticky enough. In there.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. Think it's great. Great analogy. And Jam jamal I'm said it the other other week of, like, bridging from from mid market selling to enterprise selling, it's like mid markets almost like Batman and Robin and selling where you maybe have you and, like a solutions engineer. And the the mindset shift you have to make as an organization is Your your enterprise sellers more like a general an army. He needs to know you know, when to deploy what assets within your organization, which i thought was a good one too.

Client 1: Yeah. You meant you mentioned Sap, and I wanna I wanna get into a quick poll and then we'll kinda officially kick it off, but Actually, you know what? I mean, Mina has a question. So I've let's let's rock. Minute.

Client 3: Let's hear. Oh, yeah. It's just I'm kicking off the questions early.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 3: So Thomas going back into that, you know, focused on a vertical, you know, we're we're selling into healthcare care, and I'm almost seeing so if we have say five different disease specialties that we sell into. Having an enterprise a that's focused on one or two of those diseases would be a better split up than doing the regional split of you know, West Coast versus East Coast and Yep.

Client 2: Yeah. What one hundred percent. What who what types of companies are you selling into within healthcare care.

Client 3: So we're selling into healthcare providers, also some pharmaceutical but mostly healthcare providers. Yeah.

Client 2: Yep. So my So by form a team, for example, like, they're... We're selling into, you know drug developers, but then also the vendors. So it's Cro Cd further down was supply chain. So the way I have my team Su. I'll I have the majors. Right? So I have the the high end, you know, the people that will have, like your pfizer Gs user or, yep like, the really, late top twenty they won't have all twenty. They'll have a handful of them.

Client 2: Right? Right. But then I'll go to the tier ones and I'll start bringing the tier ones up into, like, of their indication areas of focus.

Client 2: So the infectious disease and what have you. And then I have other people that focused on Cro. Cd because they have the... the expertise within the sector itself.

Client 2: Right. So. Yeah. I I would a hundred percent do that because then we can really get in deep and and their their knowledge the commercial awareness they have.

Client 2: Yes. Make some real dangerous in the those conversations. That can, you know, It makes for the the the impact of your discovery calls?

Client 2: Yes. Or like, you're starting four or five layers deeper. You're not asking those, like, the silly questions instead are just like trying to, like, I don't know. So let me get some some basics here that.

Client 2: Talking to so many people. And and you're your knowledge build every conversation is more and more that's getting deeper and deeper so you can really get like, that flow going in there. So I think I would absolutely encourage doing that.

Client 3: Yeah. That's great. Great to have that validation. Thank you. So Awesome.

Client 1: Perfect. I wanna quickly do just two quick polls. If you humor us, I'll will help me kinda guide the discussion in where it's best to spend our time. So one is, you know, are you and your team currently targeting mid market or enterprise logos. I imagine here on this call, likely, but it might be something that you're evaluating. And then the second one, what has been or will be the biggest challenge for your team with enterprise sales And then based on that, again, we can spend a little bit more time. Wrestling with that. Tom without cheating, Where do you think we're we're gonna land on what's the biggest challenge? Or what what do you typically see as the biggest challenge when that reading. Enterprise.

Client 2: So I mean, I think I think you know, it always it depends on where you are. Right? Like, so if it's kind of moving upstream, from there, I think the you know, getting used to the longer sales cycles. Know, the patience of it. The complexity of it. You know, you know, you're not selling anymore to, like, an individual you know, division or, like, personal user. Gotta be multi threaded to, you know, something that's overarching the entire organization. As an objective and challenge. So you've just multiplied your decision making units yeah, this is criteria it varies, but it's gonna be you know, across six seven divisions at least sometimes but it's also the paper process. Like people get the wins they first start moving into this, and then you start going into, like, the procurement. Center. And you don't realize get another four months, five months ahead of you. So I think, you know, one of the things that I encourage people to do often as early as possible get that procurement going parallel. To the decision process. So you can kinda be a month to three months ahead sometimes.

Client 1: No. Yep. Love it. Alright. We'll close this call out see where we net out here. Okay. Alright. So we got twenty seven percent currently evaluating potential twenty seven percent in the process of moving market right now. So that's the big big chunk. Eighteen percent it's close like, one or two big blow, need to refine the process. And then eighteen percent enterprise sales focus for their go to market. Forty one percent on the challenge was actually having the infrastructure in place to for enterprise sales will go through all these because it it should be shared on. On your screen, but we'll spend a good time. It looks like generating enterprise pipeline, getting the right decision makers at the table having the right infrastructure. And then managing these longer sales cycles. Why don't we start with the infrastructure piece since that was the biggest one? You know, tom through know you're part of a large organization, but trying to put on more of a earlier stage hat, and I know you advised for a lot of startups ups what are things founders and sales leaders should be thinking about when they're thinking of building an infrastructure that can support enterprise sale when maybe you don't have that analyst, you can tap with the specialty and and and some of those things that maybe you get as a luxury of being a larger company.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, I think... So I think you know, from infrastructure standpoint, especially with you know, earlier stage start. You know, your its alignment of the the reps will create kind of that that expertise that we're just touching on. And I think, you know, starting out when you're going into market, you'll have it's gonna be the team approach. Right? But I I think it's structure wise, you depending on the complexity of the products, you might need a sales engineer. That might be you. Right? That might be the founders. You are the person that's going, you know, gonna be going through kinda like, played in that role do the expert that. I I would prefer for founders come in and play they kind of more of a corporate sponsor or, know, the executive sponsor in it rather than the product. Lead. I think if you can use one of your developers or engineers to to play that role. They can come into those calls to speak at the technical levels. Or even just be to answer methodologies. So it gives another voice to play off of. Selling wise you're not gonna have I don't... might be assuming here, but I think you're gonna have five different reps that are working one account. You're not, you know, set up to have that that complex and, like, maybe different, you know, people across the world that's handling those regions. So I think what you would the what I would encourage people to do is you you build a little bit of some know, support underneath. So you're getting some you know, Sdr or even like junior Aes that are working with it so you're again, like, kinda to to what you're just talking about Sky the I think you said jamal and said it where it's They're the general. Your seat your... Your enterprise rep is the general of it. Right? So they're coming in there. They're general that's in the trenches of the way I would look at it. Right? Like, they're out there gotta be running the place too. They're out there seeing where to go. And they're pointing the the Sdr the Junior Aes that are supporting the account with them. Know, on who who go to? so made... What the way that I generally work it is my Ease. They'll go high. So they're going to above the line. They're going to the economic buyers ideally is where they're starting. And then have your bd as or junior eighties are kinda working at that, you know, influencer our end user champion maybe touching on the champion area. But they're also spreading in into different divisions. So I think you can have a smaller infrastructure going in. You don't need to go have. They have twenty people thirty people here. But I think it's when you're looking at the non commercial elements of it, founders you, your senior execs that are in there. Your product developers, they can play those rules that are necessary. To gotta support not have, you know, a hundred employees there Yeah.

Client 1: Yeah. And so you you've got your strategic I ideally, they're talking to the economic buyer, you know, they're above of line, one of the other challenges was pipeline. How do you actually get your enterprise a talking to that economic buyer. What has worked for you in the past.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, so certainly having that level of of knowledge within the space opens up those doors a lot quicker. For it. You know, I wish there was a silver bullet that I could say It's like, this is easiest way in but I think we're all still looking for that. But I step... It's certainly it's... you know, it's with message. It's leading with value it's leading with know things that that they actually care about. And I nobody's never use the terminal. Keeps them up at night. But it's like you know, you gotta dive in, you gonna understand what's happening in the organization. What's going on? Well, you know, if the their public look at the ten k, their filings. What are they saying? What's this... What are they saying from the top? That the initiatives are and that, you know, and tying those across the different divisions you've mapped out you need to get into. I did... If you can get some referrals. You know, from, you know, externally if this current client has been these people on your board, there's probably people in this community, maybe that have or if they can open up those doors. To those buyers, like any warm intro and any capacity always helped me coming get those really conversations. Generally, they're gonna push you down the stairs. They're gonna refer you down sometimes, but it's perfect... You wanna get in there or as early as possible with the E then you can keep tying it back, keep tying it back, getting them involved and reg. But though those are the really the ways that I've seen work the best. I mean, outside of that, you're just... You're doing your traditional average. Right? You're going to, you know, you're on Linkedin, you're you're making your call calling. Get call. You get them on the phone. These people are easier to get on the phones and people think. And you just gotta you gotta keep the momentum going in the building from there. But it would be so I would have the aes that are strategically targeting those b's. Your Bd r sdr, that supporting the account. They're going a little bit lower.

Client 1: Yep. And Nathan, I'll I'll jump to your question and in two seconds. Just adding on on top of that just for from personal experience. I mean, the last year and a half at at outreach, you know, running partnerships. A lot of my job was to find a way when we were in a large strategic deal to get like our the ceos connected get like, Manny Medina talking to their Ceo And the amount of connections we all have even as at small company and, like, our dormant networks through communities like Gt m fund, other founders in the portfolio. You know, we've got Slack We've got all of our, you know, Lps on an air table like, we're only all one connection away. At outreach, we used our Vcs heavily. We used our board of directors. Heavily, We used our advisors heavily. And, you know, in this hyper connected world, We are usually only like, one connection away. It takes some time. It takes a mapping out. But, you know, getting your strategic eighties to think a little bit bigger and more creatively as you're also doing this bottoms up approach of traditional outbound, can go a long way and helped us shorten enterprise sales us a lot because we would have executive alignment kinda from the get go. Nathan.

Client 2: You That's good. I just want to underline the the Vcs. Right? Like, you guys go to your your investors for sure. Because, you know, it could be other portfolio companies. Or it could be through their portfolio companies, you can look to see where there's potentially people that are already in there. Yeah. And that's right. So like, that's that's something that's been extremely helpful.

Client 1: For us started. And also tapping, even if it's not a direct intro. Going back to the Sap example, what helped us and they ended up becoming one of our larger clients, but it was business unit by business, you know, And and each sales cycle was very different. But even if you know someone who's sold... like, you're trying to take on this big, let's healthcare care organization, go try and see what other technology they're using. And reach out to that founder or that Ae and ask them how the process went. Know, they they may not give you an intro, Might be too close to the chest, but they'll give you the lay of the line end of like hey, this person was a champion for us, this person is someone who thinks of themselves as an innovator, they drive change. And you can kinda get like, a map and and people are pretty willing to to share it I found if they've they've gone to the struggle. Sorry, Nathan, You you raised your hand so floor yours front.

Client 4: Yeah. I think it's... I think it's in this area. One motion up in coached on in the past and I'm trying to use is effectively what I call ground, which is into trying to get casual interviews with central end users of our product and just saying, hey, like, how do you demo today? Tell me the problems you're having like, board a tool like this be useful and using that research to take an opinion up the chain to an executive and say, hey, I've interviewed... Yeah. Ten, twenty people on your team and I heard a common theme But one thing I'm finding right now is people are very Kg about sharing anything when a lot of companies are struggling, many are having layoffs a lot of these companies are publicly traded, so they're very sensitive about like, just giving info to a sales rep who trying to break in. So I have two questions. Firstly, have you seen any teams use this effectively in the past? And if so, any tips.

Client 2: Yep. Yeah. I mean, I've used it successfully in the past. Yeah. I like you're kinda going in with almost like the client success survey. Research. Angle and it kind of you know, through info gathering. But sometimes it even that back to towards it's way from there. I find an effective, you know, especially early on. When you're kinda getting the feel for the the audiences of the market. But one thing I'll say is, like, when you're going in there, and people are, Mean, this is like is something for me that I lean on, you know, throughout the entire sales process. Particularly in discovery. It's it's is the beauty of storytelling. So you're gonna, you know, break their guard down and get them to open up. You know, i you're not. Their public companies video asking for, you know, confidential information at this point. Right? So you make them feel comfortable. It's like you're speaking to other people in their roles similar companies this is what you're hearing from them. You know, and tell the story of. like, I I speaking to, you know, Speaking to Nathan at Abc, or at a similar company yours, you don't need to initially necessarily drop the name of the companies. And say what... you know, Nathan was telling me, This is the challenge that he's having there. This is what they're seeing. This is what that's leading to. This is how they trying to address it. Similar line. Like, you just see, you know, naturally regards are coming down when you start interject storytelling in any discovery even if it is that kind of initial like, survey call to get the info get the support. Yeah. I used to call it like, the the water cooler. You get them talking at the water cooler about your products solutions and all of a sudden just starting to get calls from up top.

Client 1: How important Tom is that just like the language you use. In that that storytelling. Right? Like, bi vertical you really need to understand, like, the c colloquially, buzz words and the things that drive them do you do any exercises of, like, When you go into a new vertical or an enterprise like trying to understand the... Just the language they use.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it for me. There's two areas that we would lean. I mean, now like, Obviously, you go... Yeah. Youtube podcast, like, anywhere you're seeing, like, leaders in the space. That could speak. That's where you wanna go. You wanna be there, you wanna that that gives you some information there. But one thing that I I've always gonna leaned into to particular with the Ic p's. I still at an earlier, like, people are measured how they're their, you know, viewed for success and, like, you know, kind of what they're expected of. I always get that from... I look at companies within the vertical that are hiring for the roles that I'm selling into. Look at the ways that the... You know, they post the jobs what the requirements are with the you know, the tasks or expectations or whatever that the terminology from our recruitment standpoint. So you start seeing in there what they're measured by what they're effect from experience levels and, like, kinda, like the abbreviation that term terminology, you start getting into that. That aspect. That's always been you know, really helpful for me. It's so he just immerse yourself. Right? It's like once you start hearing that, know, I might call them you know, they might care about c. They might care that Arr, maybe now they're talking you know, Nr Qr, whatever they hell is. Right? Like, you know, know. And so you kinda like, you start living in there and do that. So I... That's where I go. For mh. But to today at this point, it's gonna yep approaching calls with that that area too. Is just going in doing research. Asking them finding out stuff. And and these might be, like, end users that are easier to get a hold of. You can get a lot of info on.

Client 1: Yeah. Love that. That's super tax. I hadn't I haven't actually heard that one before of going and reading the job descriptions the active job descriptions of the people that you're selling into. That's a good one.

Client 2: I like that. Yeah. It's like, I used to go go to Linkedin. I'm like, These guys are just... That you just big it up yourself. You're saying how great you did it last job. But what were you actually measured by? You were up thirty percent in this. Did say anyone care about that? And I don't know how it's it's stumbled to, like, kinda looking at the job post things that I was like, wait a minute. This is a pretty easy way to jump three four questions deeper. Right away to understand what they care about and what's going on?

Client 1: I like it. I like it. Okay. So before we go into some more like, tactical stuff that was really tactical. I love that one. This is a a big question. And it's... you know, what advice would you give teams startups, you know, people on this call that are trying to decide If they are ready for enterprise sales. You know, in this environment where things are tough Longer sales cycle, up resources, they eat up time, what are some indicators that you you look forward when you're trying to decide if it's worth it to spend all this time that.

Client 2: Yeah. I think... I mean, some of these major seem know, basic and obvious. But I think it's just it it bears noting. It's... you know, you gotta look at... You gotta to look at your existing book. You know, how strong the predictable is the current client base. You know, the if your your mid market accounts. Are they happy are they staying are they expanding? For me, that's kind of, you know, that's main indicators that I'll always look at. Before we kinda start go, you know, for the whales. At this point. Right? Like, I guess see what the current customers are telling you. And then I think you take closer look and dive deeper into like, you're maybe your tier two's, like, the companies that are just outside of that enterprise level? You know, the ones that are current clients, how are they looking doing. The ones that are you know, they've been in the sales cycle and then move forward or been kinda dragged in there delayed Why? What's happened there? Because I think that that'll give you some insight into the the future, then the other thing I always tell people when they're asking me they're, like oh we got it we ready to move upstream. We get outside, like, those kinda like, the financials, the basics. Right? You know, can you we forget the fiscal aspect of, like, being able to handle it and do it if you're waiting, you know, now six twelve eighteen months before you maybe see any revenue from going upstream. But can you stomach? Right. Can you can you sit there and, like, you know, have the patience and weight on those. You know, And if the answer's yet, you can stomach and I think know, it's you just gotta really dive deep into your current clients to understand like, if if you're ready to go after the big ones, you're gonna know through and throughout, You know, how are they creating how do they i guess measure value from your product. Just one thing that I look at. So not just like are they using it? Are they doing that? Like, how do they actually measure that value. You know, what is it creating within their organization? It's maybe beyond, like your typical Roi calculators. Like, what does it allow him to do? Do you understand that? That's working at the different levels that you're currently working with? If you're not, if you don't understand that yet? You can't go upstream yet. Because you're gonna... you know, when you're getting into eighteen different staples stakeholders as you're dealing with Cfo instead of heads of departments for budgets. You need to be able to articulate that. And have kinda, like, the the facts that are behind that I mean, I guess, you have facts that'll would be. Yeah.

Client 1: That's That's good sip. So the next question I have and I think this relevant to a lot of folks on the call is when you're thinking about hiring. So you've identified this opportunity where hey you know, we've got some big potential for some big logos. Maybe had a couple come inbound or. There's something here. Do I immediately go out and try and find an enterprise sales rep. Or do I look internally and maybe I've got a guy or girl who's crushing mid market. We've been with us for a while. As deep buyer and product knowledge I guess the question is, is it easier to teach someone? How to sell into the enterprise or is it easier to teach someone deep buyer and product. Knowledge.

Client 2: Personally, I think it's easier to teach a enterprise. Absolutely. That process you have there. You gotta teach them patience you know, I tell them if they don't meditate some start meditating hesitating right away. You know, it's you're know not gonna be getting those deals that are closing every month. So you gotta teach them like, you know, what are the wins, what are the progressions? How to, like, measure that and and celebrate that? And truly love the process of it like, right? Like, it's cliche is it, like, it's You're not gonna close the deal every week every month every quarter. Depending on where you're might be there. But I I think those mid market you know, I don't know say, basics. Right? But those routes you're running that the place that you do a mid market how you're selling it. Right? That is a hundred percent applicable to the enterprise. So I view enterprise sales as you're doing twenty mid market deals to get one enterprise account. So the email is you gotta do mid market deal through you know, this division, that division. This, etcetera. Right? You're getting multiple bias. Now you need what separates someone that's just doing multiple mid market accounts to someone that's doing the enterprise deal. Is the way that to tying it together. So it's the multi threading is the organizational standpoint a. So nothing slips through. And you can maintain momentum with, you know, that first opportunity you kinda of brought to the stage while you're getting the tenth one now to the final port. Can you keep them engaged? Keep them willing them go and keep it happening? If you can't just do the land and expand when you close that first one then go after to the others. So But I truly believe that, like, Yeah. I think if you're going out hiring enterprise people. Even if it's from a direct competitor in your space. You may be setting yourself up for disappointment. If you have that person in house, truly has that fire that desire. And even like at that point, maybe give him one or two of those enterprise accounts those inbound that come in, let them keep doing the mid market. Keep feeding off that stuff. Know, and and building and that... That's letting them kinda, like, eat while they're they're going after the rest and getting there. So I think A big proponent of doing that. I would even say, if you know, of hiring someone that's mid market in your space. They kinda you know, to the enterprise role, or maybe like, you know, kinda like that bridge in between. Necessarily going up to someone that just is purely in that enterprise role. Because I think you you start peel back the layers what I found when Peel layers successful enterprise reps. When I brought them in here when I was building, when I work them that other companies or the, you know, people like coach that are, you know, kind jump into those levels? All those support systems that they're used to. All the people that are surrounding them all the pretty documents or the marketing aspects of it. Know, the team that's doing all the hard work and now they have to do. They don't they don't think about those things when they make the jump. They think oh, I'm gonna go sell all my current clients when They come to your company. I'm gonna clean up Oh, you I'm gonna take all... I I'll those accounts are under you know, bill. He's a sc. I'll be able to steal those from bill when I goes to this company. Don't realize they actually have to do the work to do it though. They're gonna pick up the phones to make the calls themselves. They have to you know, put together the proposals. They have to update Salesforce. They can't go visit them twenty seven times a week or whatever they're doing. You know, like, there's i just think there's That's where I've fallen down plenty of times. Is thinking, plug and play. Just given the accounts given the tools we're good to go.

Client 1: I'm very happy. You shared that point of view and I will underscore a lot of that and I've seen it time and time again. You know, you go naturally, you're like alright. This person has eight years enterprise sales experience, they've They've sold to all these logos. We need those logos. We're talking to some of those logos. You get them over, they're expensive and they don't actually now that they're used to a system where they have twenty people at their disposal that they can use and you throw them into a startup up environment they're like, what? I have to do work. I i have to actually, like I'm the one doing this.

Client 1: Yeah. And I've seen it not go well. Again, and again, and again, even if they have, like, you know, people fall out love with, like, the role ex logos that been closed in the past, but you don't get the whole story all the time of how those actually came together, and it it requires a different skill set so I'm with you, at the early stage, I think the mid market reps that have that burning fire will be better. Search and they can build that skill over time. Tom, here's another question that I think is one of the most important ones is, again, one of the challenges of enterprise sales add a startup is the amount of resources they require in a limited resource environment. So truly, like you maybe have a chance to place like, three bets on some of these enterprise customers and one of them has to go through or you've just wasted it a fuck of time energy and money how do you think how do you coach wrap and teams on qualifying opportunities early What should they be looking for?

Client 2: Yeah. So I think I mean, what thing you to be looking for is alignment Right. So what I mean with that like, alignment me with with your buyer with your champion with your economic buyer, like, end users, you know, And again, going back to kinda like that multi threading of the overarching business problem. You know, they are they all pushing towards that outcome. You know, they're all impacted by the problem. You know, or they all do they all have challenges where they are now. They all... You know, they start seeing the alignment of your products and and services. Right? And I think you, that's kinda like the where you get there, but to get to those points to get to the point where, like, hey, I got three or four different groups in. Although all online were good. You really wanna know sooner than that. In reality. Right? Like, because you you don't wanna be three months, six months, nine months down the road and you're like, shit. This is not qualified. We just we could've have been spending all that time. The opportunity cost is gone. Right? I think know, obviously, like, Med pick is something... You know, like I lead in in this qualification. Thing. So, like, obviously, I particularly look at the metrics better involved here. But I think it's simple forms. What what I always coach. It's like, are these ups being... You know, they progressing or a continuation. Right. So what I mean with that is, like is the app clearly moving forward. Know, the agreed upon next steps. You know, are they helping you cast than net. Garner that greater support. Like, within the organization, Are they are they helping you move up the ladder? Helping you are they giving you intel or they, you know, or they lack a about the whole thing? Like, next step. So they're not agreeing to that, or they not... Or they're not putting meetings on the calendar. They're not introducing to other divisions or people in their group. Are they blocking you from going up around? Like some of those things are real kinda like quick for me. It's like They're not supporting me they're pushing me forward. They're not removing things out of the way. This is not Not worth the time. Or the works the wrong point in the organization. I gotta got.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. Have you this idea of like, Hope and I've been part of startups, right, who get like an inbound from Amazon. Or I remember one in particular like this big Nfl team came in inbound and everyone was fired up And clearly, it was showing a lot of the signs that you're talking about that was slow, response time for slow, But it was really hard to give up help how... Like give me example of just like, when you have to be ruthless and just be like, no. And just cut it how do you cut it to maybe leave an opportunity for the future because they're can be tough to leave things like that on the table. We gotta be brute.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. The hope hope is not a strategy. Right? it just it's gonna is gonna be the one. It's gonna take us to the moon. I mean, like, I I try to do things that I always wanted... There's two points for me. Like, I always wanna maintain the level of even business stature with anyone. I don't care who it is. I don't, what you are, how big your company is I big the role is. Like, I I believe that my time, my my product my value is just as great. As the the person that i'm i'm working with. And that's because I understand what I'm doing. I know my role. I know my company. I know what value we bring to the table. So I think if you have that mentality, you're never gonna chase. In aspects. Right? Now having that's not enough. You get a Amazon inbound. You know, like, this could be a five billion dollar deal. They buy this or whatever the hell the numbers are. Like, I don't care what you're doing. Like, you're gonna... It's gonna sway. But I think that... you know, you need to... You gotta have you check some balances. Yeah. That's great. They came in and there, you know, like, I get you... We we have, like, requests demos or or hot leads that we get in inbound. We convert them like crazy. But there's so be people that just fill it out. And it's like, from a pfizer a Modern Bi, you know, all these huge pharma companies or you know, Morgan stanley, whoever. Right? And then they never pick up the phone. Like, why don't you click the request demo, but like, I I look at the reps and read them like, you've called that lead thirty seven times in three days and you've only made forty phone calls that spam. Like, what are you doing? Like, the like, it's the perfect person. I'm like, but they don't exist. You know, I never had that. So it's like... Look, you can keep them in there and you keep going after it and and you push them to a nurture keep adding in value But I I don't believe in break up emails. I think you can walk away yeah the time he's not right. I'll continue to stay in touch. Let me know. Like, But I think you gotta Yeah know. I always keep them in, like, the tickle folder so to say, to the degree, but it's gotta be mitigated, like, don't know. I don't like to give up. Right? But it's like you gotta curb that that you're enthusiasm with it. Right? Like, you you need to really just look at in industry. The time isn't there. Because if the engagement, if they not doing it, you're always the one calling. Right? Like you can think of it I mean, so many these led to dating. If you're the one that's calling texting doing this all the time. And they don't respond until, like, six, seven times later. And then that's what you get. And then it goes there. It's not gonna move it forward. It's not gonna go to the, you know, whatever you hope it's gonna become. And it's like it's the same thing sounds. You, They could smell that a you know, across the country across the world. So I think you just gotta look at the signs and you have to try to keep that even heal to it. And I think for you know, the senior execs that on the call, the founders the, you know, Cro Vp sales like That's our role to to do that with our sales team. You know, I'll take your the brutal truth of my team. Like, what do you doing? This something? Deal I mean, something to do with pipeline deals. They actually have engagement with them i'm like crunch get out of here, but, like, when it comes to leads or some of these like people that like, showed a sniff of interest Like, You never had it. Figure out what got them interested. You can replicate that but then maybe you can get further with other people. Other ups.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. And nina says, can't stand the breakup emails. I'm with you. I think it's the funniest thing ever when you get a break up email. Like, you never had a relationship. So what what are we breaking up like, we don't need to break up with me.

Client 1: I don't even know who you are.

Client 1: So... Yeah, I would I would shove that that strategy. Okay. So let's say you've done qualification. You have a champion. You've qualified the lead There is a legitimate business case for your product. How do you do move the deal forward? And don't lose momentum you know, within the typical bureaucracy bullshit that that happens. You know, it's all about you know, pushing it forward. And then maybe a a secondary question. When is the best time to bring in a Vpc c level execs. Because you can't have them on every call. They're doing other things. But when is the right time?

Client 2: Yeah. So I think Well, let me start with the the second question first. Right? So I think I think you bring him in as early as you can. To the process, but I think you gotta use them strategically. So I think if you have, like, a Vp, you can bring them in early to get, you know, like, you you gonna bring in your executive sponsor to stage they bring their vp. Maybe they get your early access to the economic buyer. And then you would maybe use your Ceo to found that you use them later on to bring back the economic buyer. So I think you gotta, you know, you gotta a mix and match where you're using them when you're bringing them in. But I I like to get them in... You know, like, I wanted it to be qualified. I wanna know that there's, like, agreement from my champion you know, that they see kind of a use case here. In that property, and that will help me bring him in, but I would bring him in early enough they would help... I think it would help me progress it. I know it helps me progress the opportunity in quicker clip. Get the to the table more. When it comes to We got the buy and how do we keep momentum and move it through the bureaucracy So I mean, At this point, let I guess let me ask qualifying questions So when you're saying we have the bind, do I have it from one division now I need to go get it from everyone else. Right. Got it. But now I'm dealing with the the procurement. Bureaucracy.

Client 1: Let's do the... Let's do the latter. Let's assume that things are going well I believe At least I believe I have the true decision maker they're giving me all the signals. They want it.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: But now they're like, hey, It's kinda you gotta go deal with this process now. It's kind of above me now. Know, procurement in time.

Client 2: Yeah. So I mean, first of, I wanna get as much intel as I can from there, so I kinda have you know, your mutual action plan. Understand... Okay. Gotta go talk to what happens. First it goes procurement, and then I get set up as a vendor. Then it goes through security, then I gets legal, then it comes back you whatever. Whatever it is I i know i'm talking to at each stage? I wanna know how long that typically takes. Like, start mapping out kind of the calendar. With them exactly what's gonna happen when where this... And that may not be with my economic buyer that does that I may have to do that with someone to procurement but with the buyer to not lose momentum, with them. Sort selling past the sale. Right. What I mean by that is it's like There are clients. My eyes. This is the way I was with do. I'm introducing them to my Cs reps. I'm introducing the account managers. My product that we sell a global data they're getting access to it, You know, it's an online platform. It's business intelligence I'm starting to set up their save searches. I wanna know what they're working on that. I can help you with something in the interim while we're getting the paperwork set up. Who the users gonna be. Okay. Let's get them in the queue. When are we scheduling the onboarding call? The kickoff off call? So I'm working with them I'm beyond. Most sales reps are coming to them and they're like, hey, Anything from Procurement? You ready to go. Can we push legal a little faster? Can we do this? Can we do that? I'm come to them saying, you know, I'm giving... That I'm giving gifts. Throughout Hey. I was actually on the phone with the, you know, a Vc. The other day we're running a search on, you know, different drugs in development. You know, in your education area, don't though this might be helpful. For you. It's a... you know, it's a list of competitors. And what stage their drugs are at? I don't know if that's something that you'd find interesting. See you later. No asked. Just like, hey. I didn't forget about I'm helping you. But I'm also I'm I'm getting them set up. I'm they... They're in their minority clients. So I think that's what... And, you know, I mentioned earlier. Think I did. At least I wanna get that procurement process going as early as I can during the evaluation process. I would really love them, you know, in parallel. That they're... you know, the validation is happening. While of getting set up as vendors I'm getting through legal ts and cs i'm doing all that you know, to be asked that you us no control over sometimes. And some words won't do it. They won't they won't put you into that cycle until they've kinda given the ass and the bank signed off on. And and it is what it. You know, you can't you do that. But you I look... Selling best sales will keeps some limit.

Client 1: Yeah. I love the idea of selling past the sales strategy. I've used many times in the past works extremely well. Mina has a a great can I comment in question Sometimes an an enthusiastic champion can ruin a deal because of bringing in the wrong people at the wrong time to the calls. What can the Ae do to ensure they're preparing and leveraging the champion appropriately I definitely have battle scars in this arena, there is, like, these people that Maybe our delusional think they have more power or way in the organization than they do, they will tell you all the right things. They are seemingly advancing things forward. But they're advancing it in their sphere of influence, which isn't the right sphere of influence that you want. How do you think about that? That one's a tough one?

Client 2: Like, Yeah. It'd be great to meet with them. I'm just busy. So can we say it out. It's tough because, like, you want to bring them in, but I think look, I think if you're champion if they are this enthusiastic and they you know, truly a champion. Right. So it's not you know, not a coach. That's something that is like, kinda dressing up as a champion and actually has no influence. So you gotta kinda test that out. But I think if they're trying to bring people to the equation, Is that just me?

Client 1: Or the tom We lost him With ask him.

Client 3: Frozen it.

Client 1: Let's see. We'll see if he he comes back just generally before There we go.

Client 2: Sorry Tom yeah.

Client 2: That's good stuff there.

Client 1: Yeah I think he started freezing like right right at the the beginning. So I think it was if they're bringing other people to the table.

Client 2: Okay. I don't know where he lost me when I talk about Champion and coach. But basically, the bring other people it's the table that's great sign. Assume they're were champion. They're not, you know, just like over sell us in this though. But if they're your champion and they really are this enthusiastic for it. You gotta speak to him straight. You guys are the same side of the table. You, you're not selling you champion. You're not opposing them, your team working together to get this address that's literally a definition of a champion. Their goals are aligned to your goals. Your excesses are tied together. They're they're interested in. So you I would tell them. I would say, hey, Mina, I love it. Can't wait to meet with Soogrim. But it's a little early for that jet typically. What I've seen in the past when worked with companies yours and we had this in place we meet with call. First, then Soogrim comes to the table. So let's see how can we get a a paul's calendar first? You know? And you gonna step back to an ask be like, Oh, that's great. Soogrim. What will why Soogrim now not paul? And I asked that because Blah blah blah. So I would just two straight. Thank you. Politely. And just... I would I'd have the direct conversations with it. It's But that's where it's like for you and I've I've done this a few times. And most of the time it's after. The conversation. So like, oh, meet it. That's awesome let's talk to Soogrim, and then I hang up and, like, wait. It's too soon. It's not This this this is inadvertently gonna slow us down that's speed us up. So it's kinda working on those ends. From the... Yeah? Probably happy holidays seven year six. Sorry. I guess. I'm in the office. You know I think just room straight. You got it. Pull it up. But I've done that where it's like after the fact... And then I called on, like, I was just thinking, I think it's too soon. I don't... So I was like, I don't wanna meet your parents yet. Right? Just started day. Let me meet your brothers and sisters. Let's make sure I passed that test before we get to the there. Right?

Client 1: Great advice. Device slow. Slow it down to speed it up.

Client 1: So. Alright. We have five minutes, but there's two big areas that I'm hoping we can cover before we we wrap this up. One is pricing negotiations in this current market. The discount going on right now is like nothing I've ever seen in wild out there. And then, you know, the second piece is I I think we wouldn't be doing this Justice if we didn't talk a little bit about, like, urgency and creating urgency when you know you're getting close to like, the finish sign. Know those are two big ones, but if we can try and Get your point of view on this.

Client 2: Yeah. So I mean, I think look, like, the environment is wild. Though what's happening out there. You know, from pricing and discounting, but I think you Look. We're not selling up value. We're without selling in those areas, then you know, our pricing is getting hit. You know, so think the things when I think about pricing, it's it's confidently but also creative. Creatively. But I I've had my team this year. You know, we've increased our Ac by thirty eight percent this year. And it's it's been through the way that we approach the sales and the way that we approach clients in the way that we come in from a pricing perspective. So if you know you're gonna have to discount the way you position your price, you can say, generally, it's x. And we end up at y I'm just gonna start out why. Let's start there. Right? Like, you gotta know your audience know your competitors. No way, you know, get a good sense of pricing, so you don't get put into these battles. And then also, like, gonna take the time to build the case. Especially we're talking enterprise sales. It's gonna carry us further. Creates it creatively. Look. We're unsure we got here now. Like, it's it's almost counterintuitive because of idea. The the question marks. Are I'm seeing more challenges getting the multi year deals. Out there. But that's where I can get most aggressive. You're that concerned about money right now in twenty twenty three. I can give you, you know, something that's unheard of. But you're committing to me through twenty twenty five. And you're gonna have the step ups that are gonna be much more than a seven percent ten percent year on year lift. So I think it's know be aware of what's out there be what's going on. You aware what's happening within the companies too. I go into company and I know that they just let off thirty three percent of their staff. That needs to come into the conversations I'm having. Doesn't mean I need to be thirty three percent cheaper than I typically would. But I need to position it, you know, confidently and inappropriately for the beginning and don't cut the corners.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Last piece emergency.

Client 1: When you feel like it's right there, maybe you're trying to close them in December, your come, and we need to pull this in what are some levers of urgency you've you've seen give them a huge discount.

Client 1: Now.

Client 2: So it's It's tough. Right? Like, I think lot of this comes back to you know, kinda what the mutual action plan, You know, it's it's implementation date. Is a big thing for me. So I wanted to stay when I'm talking you. What's their implementation dates? You know, edits. It's driving towards that with them and not letting that slip. Know, someone says to me all my implementations. Know January first, And like, that's fifteen days. Like, we able to turn this around in fifteen days. It takes us three days ago you set up. We really only have twelve days now. Like, you gotta understand that. And see where you can pull it forward, But I think if you want, If you kinda get that goal and you weren't expecting be ready, but it sounds like they have something. They have budget they gotta exhaust. They have something. There's some reason that now is the time that you can pull them across. Go in from a position of success. Listen. We've we've for surpassed our expectations this see the numbers we put to the boards where we are. We're doing. I got more of the leeway than I I generally do. You know, if it's something that's a a potential for you to sign off before Christmas, I'll go to bat and see what I could do for you guys. Maybe I can add in, you know, fifty percent more users at that price. Whenever, whatever it is. I always try to add value when I'm creating urgency first and testing it. Because if you put a price out there, you give them a discount, you tied to a deadline. Look, I mean, let's be real. That's always the price now. But you can be... I mean, you could be blind in the sand, but it's probably not gonna be. Right. I would try to add in value. Do a from position of success. Not desperation. I I need to steal to him I quota with the like no. I've hit my quota. Take advantage of that from your side. I got leeway. But, you know, ideally, tiger's time.

Client 1: I love it. I love it. Tom, thank you so much, man. That was incredibly valuable they're getting some awesome feedback from from everyone. So all founders you who showed up and their respective teams. Thanks hanging out with us. Tom best way to get in touch with you, You big on Linkedin, check out your podcast. What's the best way?

Client 2: Yeah. Link Linkedin is is good. I don't know. I think we're, like, firewall. In Slack. Right? Founders and so I'd say Slack, but I'm not creating in Slack. Linkedin best. You know, if email me i'm top... It's Tom at top one percentage dot com. Is easiest. To remember probably. You yes, i. I'm around Paul and Soogrim have my contact in info that you. Feel free to share with anyone. Happy to talk. In How battle over i again.
