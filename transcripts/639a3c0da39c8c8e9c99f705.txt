Client 2: four. I know the humans.

Host 1: Think maybe good to that Yeah.

Host 3: But his bot joined this meeting.

Host 1: Oh, that's funny. So that means that technically, he can listen to this meeting up there Hey, keith?

Host 3: That's an interesting the use case I never thought about. Like, you could potentially not join a meeting. Have your bot. You you're sending a steward in your in your instead, basically. I will be recording this meeting from the afar.

Host 1: Well, That's right. You know, I was I was just churning about this with the every company in Jebediah, like, I And More wondering about, like, the horizontal told use is here of of this product. Right? Because, like, I mean, I... As a manager, I love this idea of, like, Have this like, Bio host channel well. You imagine I had like a summary of every meeting in Like that removes every single bottleneck like communication in collaboration coordination bottleneck inside the company. Right. Well, I can I can just like... In ten minutes a day, I can catch up on, like, everything that's happening inside my company and, like, Josh and me this decided to do this negative again like, wait a minute Line about it. That that could be huge. And then, I mean, Again, like all of the knowledge of the company happens inside meetings. So like, technically, like, to me like, the wiki... like, the job to be done of a wiki is to, like, like, a creates, but like it's it's a it's it's absolutely to the moment you've created it. Right? You don't need a wiki if you've got a batch that sits on every single meeting and understands the content. You don't need a weekly anymore. Like, you can just ask questions to that but. So, hey. Like, How do we do that around here? Or, whatever.

Host 3: I mean, I think it's really... like, each day, you know. You basically I don't know. It's like the meeting repository is more of, like, a live overview of your company at any given time.

Host 1: Yeah.

Host 3: Which is press. Mean, actually, like, I didn't thought kind about that. But, like, as a Ceo or just higher ups. Like, imagine you just, like, kind of like, each... At the end of the day, you get, like, thing and then you can respond. Be like, all all these people are trying to make all these options. Right. Tomorrow, we're gonna do things a little differently change it up. And then it's just, like, cascade out and then you don't have to attend all the meetings, you can focus us on stuff.

Host 1: Yes. And also I mean... And I I think it been only one latin category, but I would like to coach my reports on, unlike the meetings. Like, I would love to be able to have like that... Like, if like, look at the one in one, between like, Eugene and their reboots. Like, maybe be wheeled they're like be able to recommend. Like, hey, man, like yeah. I see should handled that differently, like, right I think that's valuable as well. Like, why should salespeople be the only ones receiving coaching?

Host 3: Yeah. You do get into this weird big brother.

Host 1: Yeah. It's even multi broader in.

Host 1: But I I feel... I feel like you make it used to it. Have you heard it I assume you all of right value.

Host 3: Yeah.

Host 1: They do that. Remington meeting is recording that have like, it's it's a bit of a crazy system that they have, but companies would probably be like, look, it's you know, these meetings are...

Host 3: Everything is opened by default.

Host 1: I I love the idea.

Host 1: And and yeah.

Host 3: Fuck. I mean, I wanna I want... Like, you can't have Hr meetings or whatever. You know, had other. You have to have a permission system that was pretty tight, I think up.

Host 1: Yeah, you can always out. Right? Like i only consumed about this. Is like, I mean, when we talk about it like that, They love it, but then there is no horizontal meeting management need to this system.

Host 3: Not what. As people tried to do it.

Host 1: Think. Yeah. There's been lot people who try to do it and other other people who succeeded me show you something.

Host 3: Have they tried to do it with, like, the way we're doing it? Like, you take all Zoom meetings and then you're just able to no there has been no company that plugs into into Ai, Right?

Host 1: And that does a little bit like Ai magic stuff.

Host 1: Right. But then I also won't do if one of these things where it's like, you know, when you talk about it like that's i then like, in practice, how often do you have a question that you would ask to that Ai? Yeah.

Host 1: Not very often.

Host 3: I guess I was thinking about this as like, my own little, like, just novel idea of chat Gp three. It's like, what if you ingested all Slacks things and then you can ask questions across Slack, basically. Like your slack your company. Because like. Exactly.

Host 1: You see the gist?

Host 3: There is a No.

Host 1: Let me show you. Can you see my screen git hung gist or what?

Host 1: No. No. No. It's... Can say this. Sure. Yeah.

Host 3: This he it is basically this.

Host 1: It is.

Host 1: Yeah.

Host 1: So right now some reason.

Host 1: Interesting. Everyday sending similar. It's gold man. It's something awesome.

Host 1: Click can't valley wanting Steve, but the possible scam Yes.

Host 3: Hey that's that's but, like, you can ask it, like, Like, that that was like, I had like an idea for that. Like, it would be like But then everybody I to, like, ingest... You have to ingest, like, literally everything from your Slack and then be able to answer, like, intelligent questions based on.

Host 1: Yep.

Host 3: But it wouldn't be... It'd would be pretty good. I think That would be a pretty good business. If you can do that with Slack if you do that meetings, like, i'll, you know, like you said, all your communications email, Slack, Zoom. And then you just ask it holistic questions about. If it chat Gp three based on all of that data it has all that context.

Host 1: Yeah. Again, I like intellectually, I get exciting about practice I wonder pizza. Because like, there is that company that's called gl No.

Host 1: It eight That's basically what i'm talking about.

Host 1: Yeah. It's exactly that. And I don't know how successful deal. I I have a friend who works there I could ask Those.

Host 3: It's a novel idea but, like, yeah, It's it's also one of the things that's like, technically a lot of work to get to a decent spot. And then, you know, you've done all this giant amounts of technical work and then, like, you know, does anybody even really want Yeah.

Host 1: Exactly. It's... I mean, it is work, but doable working.

Host 3: Well, I've just said, like, this is literally just like, god. It's like integration held. Basically. Just like...

Host 3: Yeah. You're like, try to stitch together all these like, slack the way that they Api works and this Api then all these things you putting all together are the one, like, I know basically model and search you know, elastic surgeon index and trying to search across that.

Host 1: Yeah. Doesn't look like a you're product. I feel like that's the thing, like, haven't found yet yet community product in that category. Oh, no. Still not here. Yeah. So I mean, if you look at the competitive tracker, like these two categories here. So session intelligence is like for sales, and then meeting manager is like horizontal meeting managers? I don't know what me he's doing here, but whatever, all of those are actually like meeting managers mh.

Host 1: This is employee account, which is about as good as like success as you can think. Look at the difference. Gong is huge and growing basically, you see the omni category that's growing right now. Look at the average down there. Right Four hundred three seventeen, three forty five. Well, like, look at the average here shrinking. Right. Right. Right. Right? Like, this is the category is not successful right now. Yeah. Interesting. So I mean, maybe the disease is like Ai changes all of that. But Yeah.

Host 3: So. I mean, like, out the Ai thing, right? Is gonna spawn a bunch of other like, competitors I can do stuff, but, like, people were doing type of stuff without the Ai. They just had their own models and stuff before But it kind of sucks.

Host 1: If you look at like, fire, sure.

Host 3: But like, you could say that it was being done like, with algorithms in Ai, but beforehand. You were just doing it like, but the magic...

Host 1: The magic is in the details. Right? Like, if it's sucked something that'd be good and I can find right now, but, like, bio is does this dispute thing where it's like meeting recap. Pc user a research. This one, I think is good. No. Maybe it's not fire place, which one it? Other, maybe it's other.

Host 3: So No.

Host 1: It's not bell. It's other. Nobody do. So like they show you like, these questions here. And that kind of sucks like I don't care about this. I do kill about the summary. I do care the the action items. I don't care the discussions.

Host 3: Yeah. I like to leave to this timestamp.

Host 1: Yeah. The product is in that good I feel.

Host 3: I think we would probably like that. Also, we should probably jump off this call because Keith is gonna get all of nice just.

Host 1: Yeah. If if he if he's listening the inquiries when he's thinks to that this gem, Look at this. This is not ugly. It's like It's no... I can't even watched the recording it just sucks. Yeah. Alright. Cool. Yeah. Let's jump out. Alright. Let's me
