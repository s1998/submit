Host 1: I'm sure that's taken up a lot of your your time and and things right now. So... Yeah. Again, sorry. You know, wishing in the Family well.

Client 2: Thank you. Thank. Appreciate it. But I wanted to talk me today because we wanna just start to pilot. A couple of months private if that's okay, starting from mid January And I wanted to see if he can work with me on getting that started.

Host 1: Okay. First of all, yeah, really really good to hear. And I know it's been a while since we had a chat with everyone on the team, but Yeah. I guess, how do you think it makes sense internally at Ubi to set that up from our end, you know, we would just do an onboarding... I'd you to our team and and we can get started for sure in mid January. But I could send over an agreement what what does that look like, I guess on your end?

Client 2: So here is what we're doing so far this week, i'm meeting with our head of partnership, he's the one who usually works with our senior advisors the ones who refer clients to us.

Client 2: Mh. What's find the list of those profiles he's already defined them, so we're just gonna run through them. On Wednesday and then we're gonna i by industry again To find the topics for conversations, you're gonna build the lists gonna Figure out the cost it will the how much it will cost us to get those senior advisors into the platform and then boom and then we'll get started.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: The good news is that Jean s, the person who i'm working with that you bake on this project is already using Ur dot i. So he's familiar with the platform him he's using this with the inside part inside breakers.

Host 1: Oh, yeah. Okay.

Client 2: Great. So he's very formal the depressed is, we don't need to go through the whole demo again. So, yeah, we're moving forward with the with this switch need a pilot to see if it's something that will work for us instead of committing to the whole year. Okay. Not sure if this is the answer you were looking for. But tell me again the question.

Host 1: Sorry. Yeah. No. That that Doug is good. Thanks for the update on, I guess, everything internally. What I can do is what up would date in January you thinking of starting that pilot?

Client 2: Alright. I lost you.

Host 1: Sure. Am I coming in okay? Can you hear me? Miriam?

Client 2: I lost Petunia.

Host 1: Hi, Miriam. Can you hear me?

Client 2: Yeah. Now I can but I lost here. I didn't hear you for the past minute.

Host 1: Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. Not sure if it's on... It could be on my end. But what was that date? You're thinking I'm starting in January.

Client 2: Mid January, maybe fifteen to twenty.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Fifty wait let me look at the calendar. Let's go with the sixteenth or the twenty third of January. That will give us a mind to prep me and shoulder.

Host 1: Okay. So on on a Friday.

Client 2: Oh, no. We don't want to Monday. Wait. My the right one.

Host 1: Fault. Yeah. My I looking on December.

Client 2: It's see in January Monday.

Host 1: Yes. It is Sorry. I was looking at December.

Host 1: Okay. So sixteenth or the twenty third you said?

Client 2: Yes.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: To be safe, it's going the twenty third just to make sure we're prepped because we have a conference on the the the week prior so I think twenty third is the safest fax for date.

Host 1: So then on the twenty third we'll schedule a kickoff team you start onboarding and then within that week, will run your first engagement. Does that sound good to you?

Client 2: Yeah. That sounds perfect.

Host 1: What I'll do then is I'll I'll send over an agreement how would typically do it.

Host 1: I'll send over an annual agreement for that ten k pro with the things that that we discussed and they'll have in there a thirty day trial or a thirty day opt out.

Client 2: We cannot do a few months opt out we can.

Host 1: We can do... We can do a sixty day opt outs And then if everything goes really well in next sixty days, then you can just renew to the annual at ten k Can provide an extra thirty days. We do typically since we do a pre hands on onboarding with you, we often do a an onboarding fee which is ten percent of the contract value with that? Would that be okay with you all?

Client 2: Yeah. I think that would be fine. Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. It would help especially if we're going an extra thirty days. Which I'll I'll make sure that's in the contract just to make sure that onboarding fee is in there. And then... Yeah, if if all goes as well, again, we'll just we'll upgrade to that that ten k. Are you all still thinking that that ten k pro is the right place for us.

Client 2: I think so. Yeah. For now. And we can always upgrade if we want to midterm mid the contract right. Yeah.

Host 1: Yep. We can we can.

Client 2: Setting. Here. Appears this project.

Host 1: Yeah. I me too. And me too really excited to to work with you I'll send this over today, Mario. And then do we think even by, end of week we could have, like, a signature on it and then we can introduce you to the team for January.

Client 2: Alright. Let me tell you a little bit about how it's gonna happen over here, but it's is between us, don't share it with my team. We work with company called traffic dot io or Ai. We they usually are the ones that are gonna talk to you about the contract and all of that. So once you give me the contract, I send it to them, and they're the ones who handle the contracts directly with you unless unless, yeah, maybe because this is not very expensive contracts. Maybe I just gets it signed by make this on the Ceo, but I need to double check how that will work. Send me the contract and I'll discuss this with Christ, and then I'll come back to you let you know what we're gonna do internal to get that signed.

Host 1: Okay. That works would be would be good since we're doing like the extra the extra trial and stuff like that just on my end. It would just help me out if it was for sure assigned.

Host 1: Okay. So during in December, but is that is December like a very if not this week in December for sure or sorry.

Client 2: I am. Yeah. December for sure. But I will do my best to get it signed this week. How about.

Host 1: That would be great. Thanks so much for. I forgot.

Host 1: And... yeah, whenever that comes in, we'll we'll start the process when go onboarding first thing in January, but yeah, Super excited.

Client 2: Yay. Me too. I'm sorry. I'm just not in the great hat space today haven't not been in a whole week, but Yeah. It's... Yeah. Well, we'll get it signed and we'll get this moving.

Host 1: Well, Great print here. And then, yeah, again, hopefully you're taking some time with the family and everything is okay. Speedy covering. Of course, Yeah. Just just keep me updated.
