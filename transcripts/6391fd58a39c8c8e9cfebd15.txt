Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Doing good. Just just getting everything ready for the day. So you got anna and Penelope here. And just waiting for billing and I'm waiting Sounds good.

Client 2: Does anyone happen? Is anyone doing anything for each time?

Client 3: I think billy is improvising Okay.

Client 2: Nice. Nice. Yeah. The the code game was fun. So was lot on the black. Awesome. I.

Client 2: Is bill Joining?

Client 4: She says she's gonna be joining from the car. She's probably gonna call in. But we can start with without.

Client 2: Oh, here is.

Client 2: I'm really. How's it going?

Client 5: It's going well. I'm mean transit, so I'll I'll stay off camera and note to disturb everyone.

Client 2: Okay. Gonna go ahead and share my screen, so we'll just try to articulate everything on the screen. As much as we can so you can get as much details here. So moving to our meeting. We're gonna use this report runner now. To go over the dashboard just because it's a little more comprehensive what description column here. So what I went ahead and did is pretty much added the description in here for each account just regarding about where everybody is and try to take out some of the the unnecessary columns that clean it up a little bit. So just gonna kinda run through these accounts real quick. I'm starting with p. So I did have my feedback call with him last week. I I I shared that feedback in the the Cs red and tagged all the relevant parties but pretty much where we're at right now is Bart said he does not wanna run another matching around until the email issue is fixed. Totally understand him on that. I asked Jebediah and then and this is all in that thread as well. Bart ideally is gonna take December off and was hoping to run something in January. Jebediah. They can't guarantee you know, the issue would be solved by January.

Client 4: Is this just switching the domain that needs to be done?

Client 2: Yes. This is just switching the domain that needs to be done. This this is in regard to that.

Client 4: So And that's all that's all a project once is he just wants the domain changed. To fix the issues or is there anything else?

Client 2: Well, well, the main issue was that we were getting caught up in people's spam And so switching the domain from where we do our marketing campaigns, and not running the marketing campaigns and the the engagement campaigns from the same domains. We just want that switched over. So the emails aren't getting caught in the spam anymore.

Client 4: Okay. Could he run them without sending the emails in the meantime?

Client 2: So he said he could, but I think he really wants to leverage the orbit invite emails. I I can ask him if he'd be willing send his own emails. But on the call, i didn't like something he was super interested in he he really wanted to leverage the tool. I think just coming from C and he wanted to... Like... Yeah I think he just feels that... Because he's paying for the email service he wants the email service to work. And wants to use it. So I curious to hear anyone thoughts on that.

Client 4: I don't think who balance sent emails either. When we talk to the generalist, she said that they had to send out that they didn't even have a platform.

Client 4: So there was... I think they were sending out the emails on their own. So I don't I don't think avail was sending out the emails for them.

Client 2: I can double check. If that be something he'd be interested in still running a still running around December and either not any emails or sending his own emails. But I know that was a pretty hard hard pressed for him right now he he was also really excited when I mentioned that leading into q one. We're gonna look to remove that that scheduler restriction. And he thought that was great and really he's really happy that his feedback was being taken into account. I can definitely say that that he felt very hard and and listen to and I think he's Jebediah a great job with his list of points that he prepared for me to go into the call with. But the the email issue is is still just the biggest issue that came out of that.

Client 4: Okay. But we do have it on the map for q two to especially the domains. So I would try and see if he could just send out emails on his own or show him we're no longer getting... Has been the email stuck in span of Oh more shot. In the short term while we're waiting, so they don't mean to be switched.

Client 2: Yeah. I can... I can we talked on sir. I think it's talking on Tuesday. So I can follow up with him again today on that.

Client 4: Cool, did you show him the inside dashboard?

Client 2: I did. Yeah. He was he was really excited to learn more about the dashboard and think that's gonna be really helpful because it big thing he's after is, like, data. So he he loved the dashboard as well.

Client 4: Cool. Great.

Client 2: Moving down to operators guild. So So we kick things off of them I think things are are gonna go really great. They had a few hesitation regarding past matches that they ran So Jebediah in in ottawa. Actually, we had a third ago talking about potentially adding those matches into like, a fake engagement. So the database would recognize those matches as have been processed on the orbit. The orbit. Platform, and then it wouldn't match any of those people, They were go into that six months blocker of not rem matching folks. So I let them know just Because of the left right now, the engineering left that this wouldn't be something that would be the first engagement ideally, like, they are going to have to kinda, like, just be patient with us and it's something I think we'll we'll get work. Okay. Rush. On their end really excited to know that think we have a a pretty promising workaround for them to use. Jumping down the startups dot com, so I I put this one in high alert because I out a key shot I'm Friday, Monday and yesterday and have not heard anything back. This will have the engagement set up ready to go. They were simply just waiting for their their management team to approve the engagement rate we talked about this last week, like I said, followed up ten three times in the past five days in haven't heard anything back. So I'm moving that into High alert and wanted of the flag that immediately.

Client 4: Lee, do you wanna try return to him? What's your relationship with him?

Host 1: What do you... Like what do you suggest here? I mean, do you think that will help Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. I I think I think any any point of contact she should be helping the Cs has on the communications to him sorry I can I don't know if you're on the Cs but I can forward you out the last the last communication I had with him and just to see it maybe be a different voice resonates with him, but Things were humming along and then like I said, he kinda just just wanted the hi nation have heard from him Okay.

Host 1: I'll I'll follow today. I'll I'll see if he comes back online.

Client 4: They're opt out is coming up pretty quickly.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. And that's that's what started getting more and more worrisome as I I didn't hear from last week, and I know they have the round set up So just just wanted make sure I flag that as Like I said, earlier last week, I was hearing from him and things were fine, but since Friday. He just went dark.

Client 4: And so did we make the around... Their isn't live?

Client 2: The round is not live. No. Because he he did all the work in the platform form and he just kept letting me know that, hey, my management team needs to approve desk before we can send out any communications and that's all i'm waiting on. That's all waiting on. And then all kept all us. And, like, hey, how are things going? And he's a good. Just waiting on to wait out than Friday, he just went completely dark. And like I said, all done from on Friday, Monday a, and yes. And haven't heard anything back from them.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 2: Angel Club just have them on the dashboard, but they are kicking off in January. So no no big updates there just working with them to get that. That first call schedule So What's it for So it they Truck was the one that Red. Hey. I actually wanna wanna push this back in wanna kick things off in January. I know that the contract starts in November, but we just think we'll have better better rates doing that. So We're still in that holding period, and I have a a reminder to reach out to them on the first or where with those on the first. Second. And just to kind of say, hey, where things out? Are you ready you're ready to at the ball rolling here? Octopus venture, so Galadriel, I did I did send you a follow up the email of the last bit of question here is that i all of us called up on. So just waiting on that. I think this is gonna be the last from what I kinda seemed made it seem like. So as soon as we get those back, confident we're gonna be able to get.

Client 2: Onboarding call schedules.

Client 4: Okay. I think I can... I'm gonna try make time for that today.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. I I just... The questions are asking are just well out of the scope but what I know about Orbit security policies and stuff like that.

Client 4: Well, the last two questions actually are more related around, like, how we get the contacts into the platform.

Client 4: It's like they Just have... Actually, my benefit from a demo. I we can go through it later, but it actually seems like they're they're questions more around like, how the members and the contact information get into Orbit.

Client 4: On the security of it. Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Happy to go over that and answer anything that I can as well. Radical Vc something, and I have had conversations on this with lee. He help me game plan on this one. So they only have four percent opt in rate. So they have a feeling that they're gonna churn, but we and I offered them another pilot after the holidays. Ideally, we want to kinda take the holidays out of the equation and let them run thing in January and and see if we can get better opt rates. So hogan week we can save this one.

Client 5: Yeah. Actually on that note. I know we always hope to save someone of the second time around but even You speaking have we managed to turn around a pilot? Everyone that I could think of from the top my head. When we... When we offer them a second round, it just really works. I'm just conscious of everyone's time. Can we think of some success cases where it has worked?

Client 2: So part I I looked at medical Alley. Was the... Was there pile around the it kicked off a little bit before I came in and I kinda came into the middle of it. Was the pilot around four three matching rounds or did we keep feeding the matching around to get them No.

Client 4: It was it was three three matching rounds on on three different audiences.

Client 2: I'm three different. Okay. So that's that's what it was. Yeah. Because I I know some of our audiences like Sv, They ran, like, more of extended pilots. But I guess, thing. The inner workings of the agreement details that I I kinda came in a little bit after that. So No. I don't I I i i I don't think I can personally point to one that has been saved from offering another matching round.

Client 4: And with radical, they didn't pay onboarding fee and we don't charge them until they commit to an annual agreement. So they're not paying us for any of this work, and they are only on a central. So Okay.

Client 2: So maybe not putting as much effort they're trying to get them to run the second time in letting them churn if it's not for them. Is that the consensus Yeah.

Client 4: We actually haven't been counting them for revenue had i anyway because they haven't there's nothing that they're paying us for. So they're not letting them turn what impact our Arr.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I know I know some extra work went into them on least side getting leo a prep for her her her discussion with her team to trying to sell it. So definitely a lot of work has went into them. So Yeah. If if it's not for them then you know, we can I think wait to see Malia comes back with, but we we won't make a full court flash time.

Host 1: Always better to save a hot prospects. I mean, I don't I don't think she's gonna come back because her results are pretty low. But I mean, you know, ideally, we can convert them later on You results, Like, what what would be different if we ran it a second time just to After holidays please.

Client 2: I i I I think the big the big push would would be the holidays. Yeah. The big push is taking the holidays completely out of the equation. And and letting them try to see if that works.

Client 5: And they finding their operators, the portfolio companies.

Client 2: Yes. So they invited their their researchers and founders community, which is what they always wanted to pile title it on and also suggested opening it up to a broader audience as well.

Client 5: Not just.

Client 2: And their founders. In Leah. You know, of course, you'd be interested in it, but ultimately least she have to you know, meet with her team and fully decide and I believe we if I'm not they can she said that conversation is happening today. Right on Thursday? Is what she said on our call that Yeah.

Host 1: You mentioned that you're gonna a chat but she already came back to us they said that they won't be renewing So maybe that conversation got moved up.

Client 5: Yeah. Okay.

Client 2: Moving down to eve well. So that this is one that we have. They extended to pile it on and well technically not yet because I have inside the service agreement, but that's out to them for a one month that few things that are gonna be different. There were a few things that came out of this once i posted this and the cs sales channel, I believe from our conversation with them. One thing that's ideally gonna be different that was a big... I I think the tractor for them and and a loss of trust, was when the meeting links went down last week. And their their first conversations were actually scheduled in that same time window. So their first conversations got pretty much couldn't happen because the meeting chat went down, we quickly helped her reschedule them and earn some trust back. By doing that and all those conversations that were impacted are now all reschedule, but is great. But she also did mention that she didn't appreciate luke's message to the the audience members She said she just wished she would gotten in a heads up before any communication went out to her audience Members she said, we totally get the spirit. Really appreciate it. And we understand what we're trying to do, but we're trying to make it like a white glove service, so she's like, that's I think, like a learning point for orbit moving forward. Also mentioned that in in my notes there. On the Cs channel. So for things that are gonna be different in this pile around, just You also mentioned that they came to orbit for groups specifically and they have they do not have and one on one matching around. So this is going to be another group session, ideally, you know, we're gonna earn some trust back with all the meetings flawlessly happening. I think we earned some back by helping reschedule everything. And she she kinda did a little bit and Lee and I kinda have both mention this. Is she said the reason why She didn't appreciate the message from Luke is because they didn't introduce orbit to their audience. And we pretty much said that is the first thing you are supposed to do is introduce the audience to orbit So she said she's gonna do a lot more promoting of this first round which we totally covered on the onboarding call. And so we're thinking that maybe be paired with with those two items that this one that will go a lot smoother and we think we can we can convert them.

Client 5: So unfortunate that she didn't appreciate the faster reaction from you he was actually saying that And participants were responding to him. All I got so cool, you know, no trouble at all. This is the first time when you, a Cto response that directly about an issue. They really really loved it. He was like, This landed so well. I'll be doing it all the time. I have code now to send messages whenever this happened. So he was really really excited by the participants reaction. So was my mind that the actual community manager appreciate that. Especially it's not some... I mean, it's I can imagine if it's for some super traditional established brown community like I think we've had similar comments from Chase sequoia and etcetera joint etcetera. But mean, another start. And we help him cut out a fire and troubleshoot I don't know.

Client 2: Yeah. I don't I I I completely just... About to sorry. I completely agree with you, Billy. I think that that shows And and and like I said, I I I mean kinda came off the call thinking that is maybe doing some projections because I think she she realized that she didn't it keep end the market of the promotion that we talked about and that also negatively impacted around. So I think with the the ongoing introduction to orbit from our community coming from luke's messages, she was, like, oh, crap. Like, I I you know, maybe should have like, introduce the community more, so it wasn't as like Many... She said it was too many unknown emails coming into, like, the equation, and they wanna just keep it really simplified I I can completely bear with, I think the spirit and everything looks trying to do Atlantic Gray, and I think his is messaging was solid, but did just wanna make sure I pass that feedback along. That were sign signify. I have some feedback along.

Client 5: Sorry, Merry just just to close the loop on E. So are we doing... Are we doing a second matching around for them?

Client 2: Yeah. So they have a second matching round that is kicking off it it kicked off last week. So it... And it it still is within their original pilot terms. We're offering them another thirty days at the same the same fee. Of their first title around. And I The new pilot will be extended till one fourteen.

Client 5: Okay.

Client 5: Did you are...

Client 4: Some... Did you mention to them that we haven't received in it a payment I did.

Client 2: Well I asked them as I sent the new contract, I kindly asked them to pay the first fee that we paid thirty we said thirty days ago. If there's any pushback, Lee I already game around that and we'll gonna make sure I mention, hey, like, this is an original agreement. Like, you you have to pay this.

Client 4: K.

Client 2: So that that has been mentioned with them. Haven't haven't heard anything back from them since we and and the... So what we sent them was to help them under their next. Sent them I... I drafted email for them to use to promote the engagement from Scratch kind of hold from some of our communities that are really successful. And personalized it to eat wealth. Also, we shared good waters attendance policy. So we're gonna implement that on this matching round and draft up some language for them to use regarding the the notion show policy as well. That's what she's gonna use to promote it. And a long alongside of that, I sent her the pilot extension. Haven't heard back from her on that email if that was yesterday? So give her some time today and don't hear by the end of the day, I'm gonna follow up with her again. But where working they get this one in. And then just closing the loop here on the last one on the list is buy So their their first round, their often so great and they're they had conversations earlier this week and have a feedback call with Camille. During the often in round progress, she did leave some feedback regarding the sales process, which I I I dropped in the chat. I know there is you know, billy left the comment there just about some of the things that she mentioned, so just wanted to just bring that up one more time, but they do not have an opt date. And I think they're very happy from the onboarding experience they had. And I really appreciate Penelope stepping in and helping there why I was out of the office that week and I think really helped make them feel confident. That they're in the right place, but excited to talk to them more today and get more feedback of them.

Client 5: Cool. And can we please have update the description, so it's up to up to date, that seems like a sales coming from yeah.

Client 5: The deal.

Client 2: Yeah. I'll i'll update.

Client 5: Cool. Okay. Great to hear that. This one is going really well. Oh, and Merry, actually, I would love to...

Client 5: Yeah. What Can you please invite me to one of the future onboarding calls as especially after seeing her comments. I think that was one we do probably more than more than a month ago, I would love to do another one and see the magic live again.

Client 2: Yeah. We definitely got some coming up in January, quite a few. So definitely happy to add you into with... Looks like it's scheduled. And I'll i'll send them send them all to you and then whichever Hopefully...

Client 5: Hopefully octopus will be one of them?

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I mean I I I I think that that would be a great one.

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 2: Then Go ahead and stop the share, so I can see everyone. Yeah. Just I know we have, like, five minutes, so we wanna leasing some time for or concerns or anything else that I can address?

Client 4: I guess overall, it doesn't seem like many are going great. Right? It's like they're signify that went well, but of all the other ones that we chatted through. It doesn't sound like any are really knocking it out of the park.

Client 2: Yes. I don't think any of them are knocking it out of the part. I think there's some some Yeah. So so some of them... I I I don't think any of them are. Are going great. I think sign five, we have an opportunity to turn things around. I think we'd be able to do that with you know, any of these folks that are are kind of like, on the edge right now, like, start talk talk, Tom and Octopus that things have going back and forth and we haven't been able to get them into an onboarding session but I think we're gonna go a lot better once we get them into the session.

Client 2: And I think they'll be moved into the category of things going well.

Client 4: Is there I go billy.

Client 5: I was gonna say, it's kind interesting to see how the second rounds performed in early January they... If we see a massive uptick on Opt ins is test metrics, maybe we should really consider not offering or executing pilots at all. From thanksgiving on. I know that the summer of twenty yep. Twenty twenty one. We've pushed a few pilots in august, for example, that tang We just really wanted the activity and the deals but i... Yeah. Hindsight. I I I think... Yeah. So certain holiday times might not be great. But let's see. Let's see.

Client 6: I was I was able to say spell as especially for radical vc, since we are offering them or they want to run second pilot after after the holidays. I can do some digging just to see what were the metrics that we got from current clients last year after the whole just to see if this is going to be successful or just had to have any idea. How how active people are and it's... And based on that, we can we can decide and suggest to them. Because I guess, it... Like, January might be a good one. But also, like, people catching up a lot in January. So maybe February might be a better month.

Client 2: Yeah. That's a great point. And I i I know I would definitely appreciate that because I from the call and I have gone and we're definitely trying to china, you know, spin as the time of the holidays and taking that out of equation. It is gonna if it things, then, you know, I think traditionally and as Billy mentioned, like, during the summer and maybe the holidays traditionally we see. See maybe like a lull and then so we can, like, show with data at that things do get a little stronger after the holidays I think back to made me do some help with, like, radical vc for instance and puts a little more emphasis behind what we're asking them for.

Host 1: Penelope, I know you said you're gonna check the numbers on that, but do we do we believe that's the case? Or there's something specific we can point to is it likely like, radical Vc, they're a pretty ideal cli of ours in the Dc space. It it seems odd that they would have such a low right. Is that due to like, their community or is there our products Like, do we know really what's going on here?

Client 6: No. It might be. Might be just just the timing as well. I mean, we are seeing a big deep in in the open rates, now, like, because of... Because of the holidays, like, December is pretty low to be able everybody's trying to wrap up any annual projects. So That's why I'm saying. I mean, I i really want to to find any chance. And I I i'm happy to spend some time on that, and I Yeah.

Client 5: Penelope, when you when you say you are happy to look at trends, do you mean across across different use cases so for the last couple of years are just for January. I mean, that will be... That will be a bigger data drill that he might have to work with Anu on to see the seasonality of opt ins, and then if we can come up definitively with that would be a pretty cool data point to go to clients with... Okay. These are the five months of the year when. We you get the top up rates This is like moderate success, but we can still take off. And these are definitely to be avoided.

Client 6: Yeah. So I'm I'm happy to do it, but I I know that Is super busy with other projects. And I'm already asking a lot about super users data. I can I can do the initial analysis that I planned on. So I'm sure if you put together another a beer cake for her she'll do it.

Client 3: I know lot beer cake.

Client 3: I'll think about it.

Client 3: Gonna say. We have, like, this sorta repeat users, like rolling three months users, thing that you can see like, December and January are very very slow months, and then things get back in February March. It is something that we already pull out and we show showing the with bi call that we do. So I get, I guess, we can try to do something. But I interesting thing until the demo day next week because Like, there are a lot of moving pieces there.

Client 3: That I'm trying to still fit in and Yeah.

Client 3: I can promise that I can provide data.

Client 6: Remember for example they were introducing group matter in January last year, and E was pointing how that... This was actually their first first engagement for the year, and she wasn't... Like, she didn't expect still low rate of engagement.

Client 6: That's why that's why I'm saying it. I mean, even even without Ana just because I really don't want to take much of our time I can go through at least the Vc clients or those at are top because I'm or I already started doing the research and I can I know who our most active clients and I can go and and see how they were performing at the behavior.

Client 3: We we also have, like, I think something who can I set up a while back, which is an engagement by your engagement setup and you can see when the engagement was created. Like, when the stats are, So if I get you my car, how did you go most loyal clients if I get that, you know, we can Like there there quick quick things that I can do. I can help you with. We just don't need to confirm the data that we need.

Client 6: Perfect. Yeah. Happy do it.

Client 2: Know something else that I just thought about, and I I think I can have Jebediah lift the hood on this in check is I wonder if their engagement was being impacted by the servers the same way t checks was and maybe their engagement was really low because a lot of emails went to spam. And the only reason why q check knew that was because he meets with his community every other week. He had a lot of people saying that it month the spam where lee is not in, like, having a normal touch point, maybe she didn't get that feedback the way two checked did. So I'm gonna how Jebediah pulled to send the send logs for this engagement as well. And that could be a real possibility of why it was as low as well.

Client 4: That would hurt.

Client 3: And yeah. It don't hurt. And exact can pretty easily check those those data birth.

Client 2: And and I think we can easily see, I think he just queries it and then we see if it like, how it got delivered. So that back could but explain something there as well.

Client 3: I I'm am sure he'll help Yeah.

Client 2: And I mean, and even if it's not to go to the to try to get hurt to run another pilot or anything. I think it's still helpful for like, our data to know like, what's going on, you know, and we can say, can kinda point to it internally.

Client 5: Well, doing reading.

Client 5: All. Sorry.

Host 1: Side I was just gonna say, The only reason I would say that might be a good idea to have radical run another engagement, like, why that would be worth our time. I mean, you know, they're closer reaching between an extra five kin revenue than like, someone who has gone through a pilot she had already slated this budget and they've had a really good experiences. So lea loves the product. I think she just bummed out that you couldn't sell it to our Ceo to use the product. So that's and I don't know i if we can guarantee that her numbers are gonna increase it might not. Turn anything. But, yeah, If this is happening with some other clients as well. It's worth worth figuring that out.

Client 5: Yeah. I mean, definitely not a case running a second pilot. It's more like it... I would say your judgment call if some clients would when you do a second round, the still demanding. It takes so many so much effort so many emails so many calls. So if they're difficult and it doesn't work, I think maybe it's worth cutting our losses short in radical Vc case. It sounds like There's a use case fit. There's an engaged buyer made use time. Definitely sounds doing the second round, but It's more like, just keep it at the back of our mind that you're empowered be like. And I walk this is this is if this is taking up too much time and it wasn't a success. We think it's not our the second time Around. Let's focus on closing and converting the winners. That was my point. Not that we should do that. But Yeah. Let's let's not be afraid to be selective and be mindful of our time of things escalate?

Client 5: With demanding clients, especially on the central.

Client 2: Yeah. Totally makes sense And thank you for the that that got to autonomy to you know, like, navigate those those situations as well.

Client 5: Oh, Merry. That's one of the first things I told you you can can fire a good water capital day as well.

Client 5: They get too difficulty.

Client 4: In interrupt them.

Client 5: Okay. Cool. Let's give everyone ten minutes before team time. Thank you, Merry for joining us through everything. Yeah. Let's let's focus song. Closing some of these hopefully sooner rather than later.

Client 2: Absolutely.
