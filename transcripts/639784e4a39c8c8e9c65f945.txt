Client 2: Got two meeting recorders.

Client 3: It's gonna say do we got it's traded by another bot.

Client 3: Think Maybe George on the Ai game. That's one my only guess. Considering let's even hear. Know her Ai beats are here sometimes but I know.

Host 1: Hey guys.

Host 1: Just Nice.

Client 3: What's in it.

Host 1: This is my my wellness eli. It has, like so many powder and functional mushrooms, So Yeah. I can list out one stuff.

Client 4: Did you get it from the Instagram ad?

Host 1: No. I made it myself because oh, I actually do have the everyday dose thing, but I bought all the individual powder and made my own because their price and don't have everything that you probably want. So I can make you guys sample packs next time I see you.

Client 2: Little values.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 3: I'm gone for a little while i'm doing for sure.

Client 4: Sure they're properly labeled. Though, you know, freak out Tsa.

Host 1: Yeah. They do like to take my powder freaking tired.

Client 3: Alright. Biting my time on that one.

Client 3: Alright. Looks like we got the game here. Cool, guys. So What we're focused on today for pipe reviews, is... I'm sorry. Mask. It's just a general call out first on the week where you need help calls in the calendar, regardless of what's listed here. Where you need support. We'll go into deal updates. We please speak to your strategy place if those were run weren't run, what works what did. I do have that up we'll be kind following that along as we go. And then just general deal updates. And then Also to, if anything news popped up any new deals that are not in our tracker yet. Please flag those. So we go ahead and and add them. I believe I look for this. We don't have a ton, but flagging that. So I'll slack this or I'll put in the chat to see you guys are following me here on that. And then we'll get down here. Is you can see... Oh, wait a minute. Refresh. My new column went away. Give me a second here to at our scoping black. Now one of the key things will be checking in these calls as we match not thursday, if we're gonna be add in our scoping flag here. So was stoked to see this added to a bunch of Deals i'm coming to this? Let me quickly save this here. Cool. Alright. We slides out to the group in the chat here and we will get going. Austin. It looks like Leaandra. At first, I'm about three deals in red on love to see it. Feel free to quickly hit on each of these and glad to see they are. Technically scope, but a gun jump in here.

Host 1: Cool. Voodoo, we have the call later today. He sent over some really basic red lines like, just one and clarification that it's Us date and not early and date. Should be all good to go here. He had the call with the scan fly guys so thanks Selwyn. Last week and sent over things this weekend. So assuming that that call went well. But he said he wants to, like, talk through Some the discounts, I don't really know what that means. Think we're good on price. I think you just wants I don't know clarification or something, but that one hoping for signature for today. So you're on that call. So aside from that know help needed. I nine. I just read back from him. He sent over the order form to legal. He said he'll have an update for me tomorrow. And then we can get a a call the books if we didn't anything else, but that one also is looking pretty good. And quick note just texted me back too. So he said that Enrique the Vp of finance goes to we've never met.

Host 1: Said that he wants more additional details on know, start dates, potentially, if they get started when That's sooner, So he said happy to chat more today on this. So it sounds like there's interest on getting the start gate push out. So maybe that one as well. That's good.

Client 3: Okay. Quickly. Sorry. On m i nine. We they actually are in red lines and all that is that what you called out.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: He said that...

Host 1: To legal.

Client 3: That's right. Okay. Cool. Then. Okay. Cool. I guess on quick note, is it... I mean it's still seem like, kind of discovery or are they leaning in here?

Client 3: Like your kinda gut perception. Because I know that I know you Yeah. It's got perception kinda matters here given how it wonky these guys.

Host 1: Well, the fact that Enrique has additional questions, I think is a good thing because he hasn't really had any feedback up until now. Jim had me sent over the demos again last week? And someone was watching them. So That's good too. Yeah. He said, Done just got off my call with Enrique, who would like to get additional details on a scenario as to start date when does the fourteen month term start. And could we get started earlier if Nets is going better than and etcetera happy to chat with you today on this.

Client 3: Okay. We can definitely right language that. I mean, we've done before where they just like, we just call out but they can amend the start date if nets we'd live prior or something like that, I'd not to not too interesting. We may be... I mean, let let's talk about it. Yeah. We we can give them some reassurance they're in a contract.

Host 1: I I also... I feel like lagging, like, I don't wanna show the new think obviously, it's not my is done. I don't want things like, oh, twenty k version. I feel like just showing that we have something whether it's like, I don't know, blurring shit out would be super helpful for them, because I think that's what Jim is released Narrative is like that new pricing model.

Client 3: Yeah. I would say lu in for discussions and we could subs it. We we should be very is about even putting three tiers in front of people, Like we don't really know how gonna look. So I would say just looking it in and I can subs that. And if we really need the visual of follow up, Like we can put something together, but Should probably be first line of validation area am. So Yeah. Okay. Great. Anything on those three or should we keep moving?

Host 1: Not set on those three.

Client 3: Cool opus too.

Host 1: Yeah. Opus two is In... So we text Maximus actually has a revenue model just They do have, like, a major services component, and we wanna see how they're doing that. We have a another call with them tomorrow. This one, honestly is moving way faster than I it was going to and I'm not sure if they're gonna be ready to buy necessarily, so the stage might be a little bit deceiving, but they are consistently interested in pricing was fine with them. Don't know if this gonna come in month though. Like, they just seem like it was totally outbound. So, like, I don't know if they were, like prepared for this, but it is moving along.

Host 1: Okay. So as right now, nothing needed on that. Because... I mean, we had the demo everything last week and it just moving really quick.

Client 3: Onboard. What's next four Exactly?

Host 1: Sorry what now.

Host 1: Go No, we redid did scoping. We had a call on Wednesday or we have a call on Wednesday to go over their revenue model and just like have and next steps. Discussion, so we just got the revenue model today. And Mark needs to like, look at it. Okay.

Client 3: Yeah. It definitely would be a key piece pick could support them, I'd say if even if what they're doing currently, maybe is feasible. Let's also disclose the service modeling piece. We we probably should be transparent there, but Interesting. Cool. Keep there. I mean got one that a little extra authority can maybe help push it. Definitely let me know.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: I i outbound.

Host 1: Hug major service component deals in my pipeline, and I just like, honestly, i'm not really or what the land are. I put this in a prompt for cad to respond to, but know that actually alliance has we signed has a pretty big services component. So knowing more about that and, like, whether that is like, you know, kinda like you to where we can't support it, but, like, it's not perfect or if it's like, hey. There's things that we would legit can't do. That would be really helpful. To know. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Feel for with me the next chat given that concern. I'd say just that out view is that if you're a business that models like, an individual servicer project, let's say, you're you know, they sell to enterprise customer and they will in model out each customer around. Like, here's the hours we're gonna spend on it pulling from our time tracking system them and like, here's how we're tagging the expenses on each project, Like, you just can't. Model in that dimension within Mosaic. So it's almost like modeling by, you know, entity for someone that we can't model entity for if using that's so as an example. So it's, like, it's a pretty big blocker. But Naturally, a lot of those projects are very custom bespoke like you probably should be modeling that maybe sheet base individually. But have to disclose it just because requirements make kind of flexing out of that dimension.

Host 1: But... Yeah. One thing to know, I did have a disco with someone who has that this morning. He said that on plan can do it. I don't know to the extent... They can do it, but it was... See something he mentioned. Yeah. So aside from that board, this one is also a nets sweet implementation issue. So I actually just got in contact with him today, and he has some time to talk on Thursday. So I brought Frodo into the meeting he accepted. It's at seven Am Pacific, but We're just gonna talk through to see if there's anything we can do. Because it was looking like this can't push out.

Client 3: And I called you said seven Am Pacific on Thursday?

Host 1: Yep.

Client 3: Do want olivia and I I would I would suspect Frodo probably doesn't make that Cool.

Host 1: That's great one I could buy jumping on that.

Host 1: One worth noting on here that is so stage three because we have tech tomorrow is. This and, I guess, health recovery. We have techs open with them on Thursday. But Wes going super well, I think that we're probably gonna win it We're doing that potentially a tip for tat. I looks like online they're around twenty five k price. But I'm kind of curious to strategize around, like, how we can if we do just decide to get them, like, make it so we also get a discount, but I was hoping to keep this a little bit higher even though we're against ra and just like leverage the two months free. But Yeah. I mean, this one's going pretty well so far.

Client 3: Remind meeting what their tool does, it's like the secure to security working on right?

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Santos asked me about it and I I told him I was, like, just you know, kinda leverage as best you can.

Host 1: You definitely need us more than we need them. So we don't really need to buy their But if it is useful then, you know, maybe, but Yeah.

Client 3: Okay. Can you just put me out fred me santos, and we could just sure ask him what latest update is there and then i we can just let's move that over.

Host 1: Cool. I don't know if he's had the demo yet, but he had some kind of login.

Client 3: You said Hr is just scope?

Host 1: Yeah. We have scoping. I sent over the order form. I send him an email this morning and asks if there's anything else we need do and if we can get, like, red lines done this week. That way we can be in a position to sign next week. So they haven't respond yet, but would say that that one's going pretty well given the demo we had last week.

Client 3: Cool. That's. Probably now my with Frodo.

Host 1: Went well. Yep. Yes. Awesome. Cool. And then brands you go have that Ceo demo tomorrow. We do need a text business this one also is, like, services, but like, looks like sas. So it might be a little bit tricky. And Yeah. So normal demo and then we need text And then ambassador Lines at anchor, I'm gonna close that ambassador just told me that this is not something to looking at anymore into until, like, next year and then ink is just been ghost. So Frodo sent an email last week and or no. And he's heard back hasn't told anything.

Client 3: Yeah. Okay. I mean, the hacking Makes heads up. Cool. Let's get over here for the second time, I know we gotta get some others in. I see Or was it?

Host 1: List...

Host 1: Yeah. Our is gonna be probably closed lost. They said they want to spend five hundred thousand dollars and I was like, you know, No.

Host 1: Yeah. I was like, the least we can do maybe for you guys to give it small round it's like, fifteen hundred, but she was like, I don't think we can do it. And I was like, alright we'll just let me know. So I'm gonna close it out. Okay.

Client 3: Okay. Well, Pause there given the other ones. I see priorities to still sitting here. I know that calls been getting brought around. Cool. Keep him a of a time here. Looks like next step is Nick and our a good friends at trinity. Wanna jump in here that Yeah.

Client 5: Yeah. And and I can speed through these as not much to update. As I ran through like, all plays from our ones.

Client 5: Yep. So trinity mean you thinking what to do there, probably just hold off, so we can skip down to the next one.

Client 3: Cool.

Client 5: Yeah I know we just went through is pretty thoroughly see have to just be Right here.

Client 5: Yeah. Courier. We've got the the call for the exec demo next Monday. I need to collect feedback on him on any questions feedback. You supposed to get that over Friday, probably which you swamped, but Now he's go off to you know that board meeting in New York. So think we'll be in a good position. You'll at us what we need by that next exact demo.

Client 5: Status here they just pushed out the scoping call. We'll be scoping with Caleb. But honestly, think that call would be really big for them. Just to get them over the hump. Of how will ingest their data, though super small. I think they're still seed stage. So just gonna try and throw them a deal and see what we can do there. But we're working directly with the founder in the C. So talking to the right people content. He pushed out our call this morning said he was well.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 5: Yeah. So I threw in chat with Brian confirmed about Cube. So think we've got some good ammo there to say, like, hey, five figures. Is insignificant if they can't integrate with your billing Crm and Hr. So he did say this could slip because it'll have to go through an approval process with his boss. So I think the theme is here just fighting for everyone to get time on calendars Asap. Athena sent him the loom the email Yep. In God's hands now. Or their legal however you wanna look at it nice audit.

Client 5: But I've got the call here tomorrow. And we'll go through the plan full total total cost of ownership Maxi sent to you that he acknowledged text me back. I'll try and get some time on this calendar. This week, Sent you over the note that he'll try and sleep.

Client 5: On. Mh.

Client 3: I'd say just if we don't get correspondence to the next like, forty eight hours maybe even in twenty four. Let's loop Joanne because I feel like like, they're kinda swinging back with a little bit of engagement and we have good, like, hooks into other numbers there. So I would just say, like, if we don't get up to my end day today or something like that or you'd, like, lunch tomorrow. Let me know we can look joan and just so we're like comprehensive here because, like, this is one those ones where deal could move fast once we have alignment, I feel like given the kind of alignment between the two teams and the exact connections we have. So Can we put we could be aggressive on.

Client 3: Frodo.

Client 5: Cool. Yeah. I'll I'll ping him then and say hey. Here's my calendar. And then if he doesn't respond by tomorrow, we'll fall with the Frodo note there. Yeah. I think we're gonna caught up this be Denisha online.

Client 3: Yeah. Totally. Cool. So it's still alive. Awesome. Go back to the top here, Selwyn you wanna jump in on any feedback Soogrim's in those red lines?

Client 4: Yeah. So having back from Soogrim's on the red lines yet. I'm sure. You know, they'll get back to them. Pretty quickly, but we're talking with Caitlyn tomorrow, so we can bring that up then as well. Just hours scope for scoping. So that one's that in a pretty good spot. You know, red lines pending, okay.

Client 3: Yeah. So just know we kinda talked to that async. The main problem was that they, like it was just super lawyer focused. I'll hit me back just like, calling out any names that in the line and, like, service prescriptions that were missing and they wanted statement of work on the services despite it being waived. So kinda just played like, dumb, but, like, I just kinda said, like, this isn't like, this is the description of the service and stuff like that because that was super immaterial and then they also sent a bunch of, like, shady things around the cap and all that. So very much like blindsided and lawyer review. We should probably, like, I think do some selling into our champion on that. Otherwise, like, that that this is a contract that could take some time to review the For like phase Sow a product description on everything. It's like, it could kinda be a mess. So can you posted there. More sensitive than it. Seem initially.

Client 4: Okay. Cool. Yeah. And she wants... She wants to the all whirlwind into. So we should have some good Jim can support there one.

Client 3: Exactly. It feels like one of the business probably ready to go and you know, they're lawyer supposed to make it ugly and then probably rolled over. So Hopefully That's all because. See.

Client 4: Got. Cool. Cool, yes. So Ara so had that meeting with you know, their marketing ops person, like that one went pretty well. And he was just like, hey, like, give us a good price, you know, in the end of the year. So got him at like thirty k he said he's he's having good engagement. He said, Like, what can we do about, like, pricing limitations? So I floated like, a ten percent renewal cap increase. He's gonna get back to me on that one by today or tomorrow.

Client 3: But that looking like within in spot two.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 3: Well that...

Client 4: That's way be tight there because we have some room to go.

Client 3: That's nice. Know we have some flexibility there because, ten percent cal thirty k arr. I like got your great have perception of that being a good deal.

Client 3: Keep going.

Client 4: Yeah. So that one That one should be good. Yes. So gets... We got to remember to around.

Client 4: They want as a call schedule or more async feedback that's coming our away?

Client 4: That's more async for that one.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 4: Yeah. So they're they're not gonna have Like, they're like, no Gonna get started like a one thirty one start day, but So gave them, like, the two three months to help at that and, you know, include that of thought like pricing savings and everything, but they're they're coming from this with, like, an adaptive lens. So I'm pretty sure. They think this is a pretty good deal.

Client 3: Do. Pull it. And then building link or champion we think may have some call. Is there any any update on that.

Client 4: Yeah. So we had a... Alan i had a pretty good call on Thursday with hammond and, you know, the other g their team for getting her name right this second, but We're gonna do, like, an exact presentation with them on Thursday. To kinda, like, walk through all of, like, the places that we can help, so we can run through, you know, like a deal live on, you know, like, some of the Roi presentation because the guy... The guy is all over the place, like, you know, this our third or fourth call with Him he's like, oh, what about, like, financial modeling, like Quickbooks integration. So just really you wanna hand this one. Throughout the process. We got some... We got some good nuggets and tips on it. You know, the the exec teams always i saying I go, like, we can't trust the numbers like, can't two x y n and z. So gonna build that into kinda like the deck presentation. Before we share with them. So it's who's the new contact joining what?

Client 3: What's their title?

Client 4: Yellow. Okay.

Client 3: Yeah. Nice. I mean, I know that was the challenge for us previously was to get to that level. So all done. Cool. Do i'll leave me on that one. Happy to join.

Client 4: Yeah. For sure. I'll you to that call. As well. So... Cool. Yeah. There's that one. I guess other one that two other ones that could be worth talking about, so stream, I closed the app but I might just have George reopen it, but they just got back to us. I flagged that one to you, like San, like, what was and of your pricing stuff. She's trying to get everything async, but gonna, you know, just say, like, hey, like, we need a chat through like, pricing and end of your discounts on the call. Like, we just don't do that over email. But, yeah, that one could be back from the dead, which would be pretty cool.

Client 3: Yeah. I saw you're slack on that one. Let me... That's about If you wanna fire it off you said that seems fair to me, but a couple suggestions there, but I'll get out to the you after this session.

Client 4: Okay. See. And then. I think just last one worth mentioning, it's like, analytic. So we a we a call with the Ea, but she was pretty involved with the actual, like, financial planning process in their whole situation is a mass We just had the discovery the other day, but we're going to deal go do kind of like, same thing. Like, that but coordinated exec prep, you know, like before we present to the Ceo. He was the one that actually had her look at it, but it's kinda just like a perfect Mosaic use case, like, they don't have a ton of finance expertise, but systems all over the place, their budgets were off. They have, like, a three hundred k miss and their budget, you know, because no one is tracking it. Things aren't sticking. So one could be a a pretty quick mover there. As well And then Stack, oh, yes Stack out there. Got back to us. Saying, like, hey. Like, if we can get some good incentives for the end of the year, think we can kinda make something happen. So ping the thing darrell to try to get something on the bucks.

Client 6: I still active friday answer, but it's good that you get a response.

Client 4: See.

Client 3: Awesome. Let me take a quick look here.

Client 4: And then cod, Yeah.

Client 4: They're kinda ghost. So getting concerned about that one, you know, just given where we were at. But I've been on them with, like, texts and goals and everything. So, yeah, that that's not looking too good. Their go to rudimentary design like, I mean, we we think the block it seems like was tracking well until the multiple metrics on one chart.

Client 3: Like, i Is that really what you think is holding it up or is there maybe other factors or you think?

Client 4: I think it was that. And then with that, they started the question, like, the the fully vague of the products, because we are talking about a couple road map items, you know, a couple things like custom metrics or you know, a couple things.

Client 4: So And then kind of the closing comment from Mark the Cfo was talking about, like, hey, like, it'd be good for us to understand what's happening here what's happening there. I could be being pessimistic about the that one he said they were busy and they're gonna get back to us with outstanding items. And you know, where we're at, but I just would like more engagement. From like, a strong deal to like put into it, like good forecasting category. From from what they given to us.

Client 3: Okay. Alright. Well, definitely some stuff working here and I mean, I guess it's kinda typical go metrics or what we've seen so far. Okay. Cool. I think I got good notes here we can keep. Keep you moving in? Anything else other quality here said Selwyn?

Client 2: Just making sure.

Client 4: Are Those the main ones and then maybe Guardian and then Glance. We have glance tomorrow But he lost glance gonna probably try to run like a price play with them. Just to be like, hey. Like, we're changing pricing. Like, why don't you just lock this up. Here's, like, walk up into the decision. And so that's that's between us and plan. So gonna go in with some good. Just plain for dirt. About how Like, what's what the reality of a plan full implementation is because it seems like they smooth that conversation over pretty well from, like, the plant side. From men currently. Cool.

Client 3: Yeah. I know we're aligned on the prime pool stuff that we were doing last time. So... Cool. Lastly, I guess I see big Eye hear. What's the any how real that?

Client 4: It's... She she's kinda ghost. She was the a. She was like, the barrett Yeah.

Client 4: Barrett. Not.

Client 3: Oh bear an Ea now. She used be Sorry.

Client 4: She's like know. Steve his chief stats. Right. Makes.

Client 3: Yes.

Client 4: So she's she she's the chief of staff, but she's been ghost since we just kinda had that, like, initial demo.

Client 3: So, yeah.

Client 4: She was supposed still using prior or are they off of it they're off of it.

Client 3: They were only... They were only hardly on it ever, but by just enough that was revealed at all.

Client 4: Yeah. They're aren't using it. They have it. But they just do everything. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean with how often price coming up, I mean, it would be great to get a probably customer in our customer base. Don't know if we do have one already, but Yeah. Let me you need to help a nudge. I mean, it's another name. I mean, we talk briefly, but we did have a couple calls and she was pretty responsive to me. So if you need an extra nudge, let me know I can container. It's again, just another name at this point, but hey.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. Alright. Let's get moving Rabindranath, you wanna jump in then?

Client 2: Perfect by the way.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 2: So finally, had the call today with the Poc everything is connected well in Quickbooks, no hiccups there. Our next step here is we're meeting with her cash, the outsourced outsource Cfo on Thursday to walk him through more of the modeling side. Just given that their Poc only has analytics on the Quickbooks piece. And from what his feedback was very positive, but he just needs that final call on Thursday with Maximus and I to get the sign up to sign next week if they wanna move forward.

Client 3: Anything about their planning process they could be a challenge? I imagine that sound like to me is a way to test our flexibility, potentially. Like, is there any potential roadblocks there you guys?

Client 3: About?

Client 2: Yeah. The only potential roadblock is that they were worried about Gdpr compliance with bringing cuffs more data into tomorrow's. Like, at the, you know, customer name for the revenue side that was what's stood out to me, but Maximus, anything on your end that might be worth finding there?

Host 7: I would say that's the case. You super impressed with, like, waterfall functionality with Gap. Revenue data, collections data, billing data. If we do wanna bring in their stripe for their hubspot, it seems like they'll probably need that to forecast revenue. That we'll have to get ahead of the Gdpr stuff.

Client 3: And did they have like a b c function? Or is it more just the company names the worried about?

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. The company names.

Client 3: I'm the lawyer by G gdpr doesn't give a shit our company names. Let's talk about that offline.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Trending well.

Client 2: I guess very much knowledge yeah. Yeah.

Client 3: A lot of G back we get for everyone all about seventy five percent but I'd say it's not about what Gdpr is about About person identifiable information, like, name location, gender, phone number address, Like, very, very like enough to build a profile of someone so you kinda need, like, multiple of those generally it's to even it be relevant. So Let me know if you guys lived in on that, we've gone to the bothered they're all that with a few recent customers. But shouldn't... I mean, that should not be a blocker for these guys that'd be shock if it is, But Cool.

Client 2: Yep. Matt, Frodo, you sent the last note to nick there. So doesn't tell him like he's responded to you there, but they'll feel pretty good that we can get him in. I think he is just playing games with us for the best prize.

Client 6: Yeah. I hasn't responded, but they read the note four times on Friday. Come in a follow?

Client 2: Yeah. That would be great. Perfect.

Client 3: Okay. Yeah. I don't know We're lying on that play. We can keep moving there.

Client 2: Yeah. Zest looking really good. We have the call with Wednesday with the full team. Haven't heard do anything think back on the red lines, but knowing that Denisha the probably send something back end of that call, but trending well twenty one k. Closed ideally this week.

Client 3: Yeah. That does. That seems like slam dunk here. Cool. Yeah. Know thoughts there. I think we're trying towards the closing on one.

Client 2: Yeah. So Also just on update. Leslie dad is doing well. Oh good there.

Client 3: Is good.

Client 2: Follows the team said they were doing their due diligence last week between those day in place a few notes to Jason there for an update, haven't heard anything back. Yeah. But he looking at my whole string of emails and all the content I did send over. So they're definitely working on it. This morning saying, hey, like, you're an expert on jose. Like, can we get in front of other members of the team if you haven't made a decision yet? So fifty fifty Selwyn at this point where their heads are out there. Okay Yeah.

Client 3: I know we gonna lever this one. I'll. I'll pause On dive into it. I mean, it's kind of all out there now.

Client 2: Okay. Mh. See. Super conductive. You're pretty looped in there Frodo I don't know if Leaandra ever responded to you. With the screenshot there, but This guy is just dragging his feet.

Client 6: Here again.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 3: That last night said to nick We're the one at Nick Sent, Rabindranath? Do we get back on that thread or what was last step we had on that nick credit.

Client 2: Yeah. So I responded to Nick on our thread just like separately with without you just mentioning like, that email of the pricing changes that like, hey, you're trying to go to your executive team one I mentioned, like, the pricing is gonna go by, like, twenty five percent potential in in the New Year.

Client 2: And then Frodo send an email to their Coo with the screenshot brainchild of Nick some email like Tobias what's happening here? Okay.

Client 3: I'm kinda of ready to go On this student and just like, call on his sell and until it picks up and then explain to him that, like, we're gonna kinda like, walk away or something like that, like, from the partnership. Like, I think we're we're almost there. Can you posted my I'd say by, like, Thursday afternoon, if we don't have anything from here.

Client 3: It's like a challenge for me him given the I mean, he's kinda been the works prospects and he get imagine right now but, like, keeping us alive, but then totally being vague and unresponsive. So let me know, I'd say by end of day Thursday, if you could, we have any court on or otherwise, I think I'm just kinda blow Excel here.

Given that he couldn't align his rev bumps seem to get in front of the tool until January came back with them saying like, hey Graham, like, totally fine there just, you know, like, pricing is changing from, like, the all you can model that you really liked to something less enjoyable. So He responded back. It's still in play for this month. It's now just getting it into a line. This internal team now knowing the potential increasing cost. Are going up there. So he got it in it's more so for him to make a business case. Just failed he needs to see the tool. Even if it's only thirty minutes.

Client 3: Yeah. And he was... I mean, Our recall he was receptive to that earlier time and he's just working on it or what Let's next.

Client 2: So he somehow scheduled the Rev box demo when the Rev ops team was not available. So that over have to push the to January two weeks later. So we're just pushing to get, like, a new time line there with him. Now knowing the kinda of compelling event for him to make his business case.

Client 2: Okay. Home base. Still finally got aligned with their new Cfo had just started, like, five days earlier for a demo. Feedback was really good. And now it's just locking down a scoping call. With them sometime this week, they were in an off site last week. So, like, aligning their calendars was not working. So chasing them down did get confirmation from both of them, but project they will make a decision. Be it with Mosaic or another competitor. In December with implementation starting in January trying to align to January t thirty board report they're trying to build. Definitely urgency there, just a matter of getting them aligned with that next step. Okay.

Client 3: Let's not scheduling become a challenge jeremy I mean we hope to book that this week. I know Caleb counters are getting a little bit tough. So can you post if we you do something more out here? Because but I think velocity matters were feel like this. One got what could do here on the scoping inside?

Client 2: Definitely give the options open with the caleb brace as needed. And then just quickly touching on some of these stage two ones triple will, Frodo, I know Russ had responded to you. I mean, it's more likely than not being pushed into this January, but that you he did send back deemed like positive enough potentially keep it in this month, at least for a week you said he would have, I think, an update for you on Friday. Or like earlier this week. If I'm not mistaken.
