Client 2: Hi, Merry cool.

Client 3: Hello.

Client 2: Good. How are you?

Client 3: Good good the other day.

Client 2: Very dark Is it in the morning for you?

Client 3: No. It's it's there's a a rain coming through.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 3: Yeah. It's a range i'm coming through. So it's just it's just really dark. Try. I'm struggling to get some good lighting here.

Client 4: Hi.

Client 3: Galadriel only let me know if she's running a couple minutes late. So I don't know if he should okay it off about her or or go ahead and just wait her since she just got to the office.

Client 4: Yeah. She's she's working from the office today and going to my old building to collect post, which is making me emotional.

Client 3: Do you think it's okay to kick off about her or should we...

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

Client 3: Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and jump in and just share the report... I have made So here's everyone right now and onboarding. Two things different from this less that from from last week.

Client 3: First of all, radical has churn. So they've we we tried to offer them another pilot. They sort of just went dark and after our conversations last week of, you know, not spending too much energy chasing Sorry. Hold on one second. So towards energy chasing. Chasing folks that aren't interested you know, we we just went ahead and moved them to the lost category.

Client 3: Okay. The other ones to mention is P. So they are graduated out of onboarding. They have ran their first matching around still still have some things in the works with them specifically on the email the email deliverable rates. So I'll need to follow the product team on that. But I just wanna let you know the two differences that you'll see on this let's for.

Client 3: Finally.

Client 5: Hi. How are you?

Client 4: Good.

Client 5: Hi.

Client 4: You calling from the, the phone booth?

Client 5: It's freezing in here, Belly.

Client 4: Oh my god. What New York or the actual space?

Client 5: Space.

Client 4: Oh.

Client 5: Remember cold it was last time we were here.

Client 4: No. I only remember the good things.

Client 5: I'm gonna just stay in this phone with all day. It's it's warmer the. When it is outside.

Client 4: Are there other people around?

Client 5: Nobody here.

Client 4: Oh, god.

Client 5: City, the city seems very quiet. Not just this space, but really, the train was quiet. Central is buy it.

Client 4: Okay. Thank you. That makes me feel good. I feel like I'm missing out a magical New York Christmas with people skipping in the streets and free hot chocolate for all but no better.

Client 5: That's a very romantic image.

Client 4: Yeah. I'm feeling very Christmas today because we finally picked the Christmas tree.

Client 5: Oh, that's so exciting.

Client 4: And...

Client 4: Yeah. Little jack the with few Christmas stars Nice little morning. I'm still... I'm still on a Us time zone. So continue doing close the us hours.

Client 3: Okay. Yeah. Galadriel, you actually really didn't miss anything here. I was just mentioning that we moved few checked out on onboarding because they technically, they they ran their first round, so they fulfill the criteria. We're just monitoring them for those product updates. On the the deliverable rates on on the emails, They'll be sending. The other one that isn't here anymore is radical B. So, Lee and I have chased them last week and, you know, after the conversation we had of you know, just really prioritizing customers that we feel have a better chance of know, actually converting not not spending too much time and energy on folks like, radical Vc in case. So after we chase them per a week, i didn't get anything we decided to cut the losses and move them to the the velocity. Category.

Client 5: Okay.

Client 3: Other than that, pretty much all the folks that we're in onboarding last week that we talked about are still here? So written some updates for everyone that has them, So just gonna start with operators guild. So anna thank you for treating those for that internal round there, ma'am. So they ran and turn around similar to abundance three sixty, where they really wanted to just see the the often process So I reached out to them yesterday to see what I can do to now get their first live round kicked off. So hopefully, we hear back from soon. Reach out to them towards the end of the day yesterday. So feel like they're in a good place. No feedback from them. The only thing I did is when we did send the invoice. It looks like Kc came back or something. Saying that they didn't agree to paid two years upfront So I just just want to flag guy to make sure that That got saw. And so I think we'll have the res them an invoice.

Client 5: Yeah. I'll I I'll update that this morning. So basically, and I talked to lee about this that's afternoon, but won't bill them for the first year. And then if in my understanding and late correct me if I'm wrong again. But my new understanding is that once they go through their opt out period at the end of this month, then we build them for the second year. So Merry, if there tell you could grab there while you're on the phone with them. That would be appreciated. Otherwise, I think we'll just build them in January if they continue.

Client 3: Okay. Yeah. And that... That's how I understood it based on his email as well and all I'll clarify that with them further.

Client 5: Okay. Alright.

Client 3: At lastly at this point, and kinda Just referring Galadriel, I know you're handling the main line of communication with Cassie. So one open the floor if do you have any update for for About, but I don't have one.

Client 5: I just we just got another email this morning back with some more questions that I do diligence nurse. So I'll work through those today. Kathy Ali office. This week, but it's moving. Continuing to move. And also, they ran So they're doing monthly engagements up to when we can go into an contract they have their December matching around meeting this week. Options were lower than usual, but think we can attribute that to the holiday. So I billed them for December. They paid for November. It's moving.

Client 3: Great. Great. Star dot com. So we extended them by a month, Lee and I worked on that extension, sent it out to them. Galadriel sent the invoice out yesterday. Key has not signed it, but I sent that Chase email this morning just saying, hey, let it like what can we do to help get this carried across finish line. So staying abreast with it, but they've been invoice now. And they know that they actually ask for a longer extension more than thirty days and we and simply told them now. We're like, thirty days is is the extension, like you already have everything set up. You really just need to like, internally get this approved like you've been saying you needed to do and hit the button. And really all all the work is done there. So they said that's why and they understood. These three folks here, they're gonna be kicking off in January. Because Angel club does not have an off date, we felt comfortable proceeding and doing the the onboarding call with them. So I actually did that with them on Monday. Went really well setting up their logo and they're branding and they're really hitting ground running. But they're aware that they can't actually run the engagement until January. Because that's when the contract start date starts and they were perfectly fine with it, but we felt to kinda, like, help build that anticipation that and because they i had no op date we felt comfortable you know, extending that back on onboarding all to them a little bit earlier. Christina logs. She got her onboarding call schedule that won't would be in January as well. And trusted health. We've already done the onboarding call, but they we're the ones wanna defer and kick things off in January. So chasing them to get everything set up. But they don't have an opt date either. So you know, their they're free to to set it up like that knowing that they are losing some value by doing that.

Client 4: And Merry, I I feel like startup experts would be in the same category. They're kicking off in January, but we have the onboarding next week.

Client 4: So I'm just wondering why wouldn't they be showing here?

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I i I need to get them added here. Actually, sorry. That that's one that I missed. I'll I'll sure to add them here. Cool. But thank you for flagging that.

Client 5: As I was just an announcement actually while we have everybody on the line. Merry lee Belly. I as I was doing invoicing yesterday and going through the Salesforce records to do that. I'm noticing that contacts aren't being attached to the opportunities. The challenge with this is a, if you're not attaching contacts the opportunities and your emails meetings are not being synced to a Salesforce. And then also, if we go and send out the newsletter, they won't be part of that list. So please make sure that you're adding the contacts, I asked also go through with all these new ones and make sure that all people involved in the sales process and then Also through onboarding are added to the new ones, but please just keep keep an eye out for that going forward.

Client 3: Absolutely Thank you.

Client 4: Flagging.

Client 3: Quick update on octopus ventures, so billing I met with Ben yes today. They said that they feel that we have pass through all of the compliance stuff and they're good to scheduled to kick off call. We also talked to them and and Billy gave a short update in the the Cs yes channel, but let them know that this is no longer a free pilot. It's actually gonna be a paid pilot because we had but so much time energy jeans they account already. Ben seemed like he understood and said he'd work on getting the onboarding call scheduled for Monday. So I actually just have him an email before we hop on the line and said, hey, where things out with getting the call scheduled on Monday. Let me know if I need to help. So keep it at matching him thank you.

Client 3: That's great. I didn't want that to go too far.

Client 5: That's great. And so we don't need to send them the soc two type one certificate?

Client 3: No. So so we on the call and and and Ben said that that we had surpassed their through everything.

Client 5: So Great.

Client 4: I, unless he's misunderstanding things, I mean, he sent oh the last thing that we sent...

Client 5: They asked us if we would sign their Nda, which it was pretty much reflective of what's in our nda. So I signed it returned it and said they needed to counters sign it before we would send the Soc two type one certification. And they never returned and they didn't reply that email.

Client 4: Oh, okay.

Client 5: Maybe they have... I mean, we've given them so much documentation to this point. Hopefully, they have what they need.

Client 4: Okay. Yeah. It's just super super frustrating him trying to, like, and the free pilot, which was all... I mean, it was a given. I knew this was going to be the case, but Yeah. Merry, and I appealed to his, like, I mean, we've invested so much time. I think it's quite I think grid quite fair we'll back and forth so march, and the team has put so much effort into the security Thank you. Galadriel and Merry for handling all the security stuff for Octopus.

Client 4: And he was like... I need to go to the team I was like, well, what why do they say? No? To paying for a one month pay trial. And I was like, well, I trust that you will defend the case because otherwise, be squeezing a seed stage startup and you guys are like, vc, and it's eight hundred it's eight hundred pounds.

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 3: Handling that.

Client 5: Yay. Amazing.

Client 4: Was part charming part trying to appeal like, yeah, bring out the violin, part, I threw you in. Galadriel, I was like, we have a new Ceo. She looks nice, but you know, she's really holding me accountable. I waive the onboarding fee for you. I I gave you a free pile. Really against three pilots because b is like, proven we like proven use case. I'm doing this all for you because you're in London and we'll go out for coffee during weeks time. I was laying it on thick. It this thing better go through the line. It... I mean, so much energy has come into it. I'm keeping positive. If anything, it might get a little bit delayed because of Christmas, he said, A lot of them are breaking off with different people from the team. Going going off on Holidays from next Tuesday. So He's trying to align calendars for onboarding call on Monday. still taking long.

Client 4: On the last. Merry. Can you change the opt date to the end of January just to case according to what we verbally agreed.

Client 3: Yes. Yes. I can change that for octopus spencer thing. And I I see I need the change on Salesforce a couple of these as well. So i change. Start as well I'll need to change heat wealth because they've been extended as well. So let me know my list here would do.

Client 3: Okay. So... And then with you well, so they were extended to run another pilot round. So they they kicked off the second round. They have any options as of now and those conversations are set to take place the the second week of January. So quite a long off got period you wanted to extend that opt down period, but holiday is coming up. They are going really apart with promoting it, and I've given them verbiage that some our most successful customers are using and have essentially customized it to their specific workspace. Because Joy mentioned that she didn't think she didn't think she personally did a good enough job promoting it. Last round. And want the know what we thought we did. So we just help we just drop some stuff up and said, hey, use this. So that's what she's using. And we are are... Lee and I have been like, tag team in this one really hard. Was really trying to get this one to convert. But That that's where they are right now. And then folks to mention that aren't here, I apologize ability need to get them added is gonna be startup up experts. So Billy and I work going to are working with them to just get the onboarding call schedule then we're going to do it tomorrow. So need to get them added here. So apologize that i'm missing information, but those those would be And then other than other than Debbie would be the last one as well, who's kind of like a edge case I feel like. I can add them here as well, but I know they're kind of in in the middle right now.

Client 4: No. I think we we keep this only it for opportunities that are signed and they're still not signed. But anyone that has signed, like, yeah. Startup experts should be here going forward.

Client 3: Okay. I'll get them out try that that was my mistake here.

Client 4: The amount get them out of wear. Get them in.

Client 3: No? Get them in. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. I'll I'll get them in here. Sorry that's my mistakes are not having them Yes. Okay. Just call me. Gonna go ahead and stop the share, so I can see everyone's faces. Yeah. So happy to field any questions on any specific accounts and also just open the floor for any general discussion of onboarding Yeah.

Client 4: Just just talk maybe, I guess I don't think we synced up with in the latest developments, we had a call in the calendar was supposed to be an onboarding call but because we're still going back and forth on the contract. It didn't get... They haven't revised D center for signature. Was like, hey, do you think that's gonna happen by the onboarding call yesterday that were like, no better to reschedule. Got the res scheduling link. So now we're supposed having no boarding call on Friday, the last available. Day for the community manager. My ten Pm local time. The joys. But yeah that's the last thing I gotta do the year freaking do it because it's an exciting opportunity. But let's see. Let's see. They still have to get back with the amended contract. A push pushing and pushing. But... Yeah, It really we... It really feels like this is kind of the last working week weekend which we can expect a response from people.

Client 3: Yeah. A lot lot of folks will be be coming in and out and Yeah. So this is a a good final push here.

Client 4: Glad was sneaking in a couple of onboarding sessions. So Merry, I know you invited me to the one with startup experts. Galadriel it's not going to be with jessie the founder in do someone that gonna run the program. I'm not sure if you want to jump on that call? Given that we included you in the package.

Client 5: Yeah. I'll just fine whenever whatever it is.

Client 3: I can add you right now. I have the invite pulled up right now. So let me get you there. Okay. Sending that your away. Right now, Galadriel Yeah. It is Sorry. It's so dark behind me. It's like a like a storm coming in or something today.

Client 4: Yeah. It's like very different to usual Yeah.

Client 4: Like background.

Client 3: Storm coming in today. So imagine it's gonna be dark for most of the day, but think I got this little handy light, it's got a bunch of different settings on it I really love it. Because I can change like the light and depending on.

Client 4: Oh my god with the remote control, Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. It was it was really cool. Is it good it was a good amazon fine.

Client 4: God. Does it go with, like, purple lighting as well?

Client 3: So prospects.

Client 3: I had one just like this. A did different lighting and even, like, went to music, like, it would like sense the music and and move to, like, the base zones, I guess, and I had it I had the board wrapped around it when I moved and my girlfriend was helping me on i and she was, like, trying to get the cord out and rip the cord right out from the the light itself.

Client 3: So. That's why I have to end up getting one, but I had a really cool one before.

Client 4: Cool Penelope How are you doing? Anything interesting?

Client 6: No. I'm just Yeah. I'm just dealing with some stuff from for safe site. Because they engagement, and it seems that most of their users, like they they the users haven't led any feedback, but this engagement was actually run by safe site, but it was for for one of their partners, one of their clients. And now they're panicking why they don't have any feedback. And yeah, I'm just trying to deal with that So it it's very because through there's no data at all about that.

Client 2: Like... The only thing we know is that they and the emails. So like, most people opened the emails, And then nobody responded to the invites. Nothing happened there. So there's no data from the daily rooms as well. And We don't know.

Client 6: Yes.

Client 3: Oh, and a a quick update on radical Vc. I asked to Jebediah to look into that email issue that Check was nav? And their low opt was not related to the email servers that p check was reporting on. So just to close the loop on that. That's doesn't seem to be an ongoing issue. So I think we're probably good to tell bart attack run engagements from our research as well. Okay. So pick a quick update to close the loop on that.

Client 4: And just another one on another client, Penelope, I'm just thinking about Ne nda given that Darcy confirmed I mean, she was a hundred percent saying, She was like, no, at this moment in time, if we discontinue Orbit gonna harm our founders. That's the to they get most excited about we're definitely confirmed converting just just wondering is someone whose inbox is super swamp if we should just send her the agreement and see if she might sneak finance.

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 6: Definitely.

Client 4: We just give him a try. She how she... Has she been the one that's previously sells signs them?

Client 6: I need to double check that. On Salesforce.

Client 4: I mean, i I think she's still working next week. So she might have kicked off a bunch of admin Definitely, we'll definitely...

Client 6: It was dire.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 6: Yeah. We'll definitely send it like either today or or, like tomorrow the latest.

Client 4: So... Yeah. Okay. I feel like She's verbally said it on the same day that you sent her the email.

Client 6: That's just.

Client 6: Yeah. I just wanted to have it, like, written down, but seems she me to you.

Client 4: That's that's sort.

Client 6: I mean, the agreement is the most important part though. I don't care what have emails.

Client 6: Exactly.

Client 4: Cool. Alright.

Client 4: And I mean, for anything else that's more of a thing aside from onboarding sessions, we don't... Do we have any conversations that are happening next week?

Client 6: Not from Csi. I I had my last one yesterday with Anthem. And I'm still doing some research this use case they're going to to have with the. So... Yeah, nothing. Nothing else on my agenda.

Client 4: Okay.

Host 1: I have a couple contract negotiations next week. So there are still people I would say work for the next couple of weeks.

Client 4: Nice. Who are you speaking to lee?

Host 1: They're both Vcs, the old five k deals. But Okay.

Host 1: Yeah in let you did everything that I have opened and still vc account believe it.

Client 4: From all the different use cases we're pushing. Back to back to the That's the good old busiest.

Client 3: Yeah there deal accounts Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. The Vcs are tried and true and they they Oh, it always seems to be a smash. So I know we definitely wanna expand the use case, but like you said every every deal helps and we go... We know they're good customer. So Yeah.

Client 6: Maybe the the car thing with the Vc that there is a lot of around their renewal.

Client 6: O at least that's that's what I've been observing. But Yeah.

Client 3: That is that because of compliance or or or like like I love to hear more in the observation.

Client 6: No. Maybe maybe just because they're super, like, super gorgeous of their budgets.

Client 6: Especially these times when everybody is getting very tight on that Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. There's some the very affected.

Client 6: That's true. And they're always cutting of the like, the very the very first thing they're cutting out is actually any that they have. So Nda, obviously, it's a different different case. But yeah, I'm glad that today they don't want to leave Orbit and that we are bringing value.

Client 4: Yeah. I think it's the smaller funds.

Client 4: That also don't have resources to manage the program well. I think for The budgeting was a lot bit money use because we did have the call and unfortunately, they did say they they're considering buying other tools that are gonna fit their needs better.

Client 4: Yeah. Well, we're on the same call. Do you remember she was describing something that syncs up with their Crm and figures out who can benefit from what introduction?

Client 6: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Client 4: It's the smaller ones. Where or like, rise the rest with lower utilization again, probably attention to detail. But look at.

Client 6: Are not leaving us for sure.

Client 6: We just need to make sure that everything is going well with with the Lps because there network developers have have grown lot like, over the past few months and, like, g really really wants to put our into application there. So... Yeah, I I raise the questions today. Galadriel, you can see that in plant execution, I will tag you there and I sent a email. So we have all all of that map out until January when we can actually keep it off. Although I told her yesterday it may because she's also like, very, very you know, cautious of having everything everything right, just leaving the the best in first impression to them. And I told her that maybe maybe it would be great for for her also to wait we are introducing edit matches, so she has more control over the matches in in case something something goes wrong, but I don't think that like, something will go wrong. So... Yeah.

Client 4: Oh, actually, Penelope, in some of these calls, would you mind see me in and even throwing a sentence in there that I'm relocating to London, because I'd love to. The people that I love to meet in person.

Client 6: Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yep.

Client 4: Alright. Anything else? Nope.

Client 6: Nothing Was that archie?

Client 6: Yeah. That's strategy.

Client 4: Alright. He's like, okay. Wrap it up now.

Client 6: My guys Day
