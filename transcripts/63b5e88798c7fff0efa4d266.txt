Host 1: And happy new year to everyone. Let's dive right have haven't it done to talk about today. Let me show my crane I like a new intern.

Host 1: I know. Yes. I was telling everyone. This is the end of in there I having meeting on Zoom for the first time.

Host 1: Can everybody see miss ring?

Client 5: Yeah.

Host 1: Alright. Let's to talk about today. Two big changes. I talk about the long vision. I'm gonna give you a quick demo of what we've been up to for the last few months. Pretty exciting step actually is, impressive. We're gonna talk about def and modes, because that's generally a position that I've I've been having a lot these days I wanna talk about even get next steps. By the way, I'm I'm gonna be coughing and recovering from Covid, but I'm I'm fine right again. Right. To big changes. We are refocus the map we're making some pretty drastic cuts and we laying up twenty four percent of the company. Eight people mostly in good market. And I think we're doing this will be clearer once we've talked about the other changes. We're refocus the map. I I showed this slide a few months ago, and they've been showing it to the team and I've been doing a lot of thinking during the holidays I look at this slide and I look at this vision on the one hand. And I look at this road map on the other hand, and I see a pretty big gap between these two things. And I've received feedback from some of you and of the team as well. And I agree. It's good feedback. They're like, been like focused. We've been having too many things on the stove considering the stage in which we are engineering our size. So we are cutting continuing the divert of the sales pool and the built office his work we're focusing on the conversation intelligence chance. Why focusing on the conversation diligence because that is right now piece that we're working on that is most aligned with the long vision. No Guys spend a bit of time talking about that. But a quick minute talking about the build office. That's obviously, a decision. This is not here. We've made it three or four months ago. I think at this point, it shouldn't come to a surprise as a surprise to anyone. It's painful, but You know, I think it's necessary. It's a high decision. I think that the bet on the virtual is made a ton of sense given Covid and given the rise of remote. But, you know, the category has not hasn't been out. Right? And that's after a lot of capital lot of talent and a lot of different approaches when after the best time for is kind of opportunity to work out. Right? And at this point, of I've lost track of the of deals. We've seen cool stag or people didn't time. So it's send them remove revolution privately, data tails is not doing well. Category hasn't been out full nearly. So moment consult with legal counsel before making any announcement, but most likely we're going give four weeks notice to custom and we're going to... That's gonna allow us to move on.

Client 5: Side. So we will proactively shut it down and you said four weeks small. Give people time and and rooms or it was about a half million in Arr by doing that.

Host 1: That's right. And we'll get that, we're gonna have to refund some custom mills. I said is not going to be allowed money just gonna be something like a hundred thousand. Yeah. It is hundred million in a. I I think in the greatest scheme of things it's going to be a rolling error. I mean, when this company needs to be billions of dollars. Like it's not happening in that's being to make a difference. I think that the distraction is not wheels the have million dollars of revenue. Okay. So again, that's gonna allow to move on and and move on to what like I said, think this conversation intelligence bit is the piece that is most aligned with long vision, but it is not dead center of it. Right? I still think I still think it's necessary. Why do I think it's necessary? Because I I do believe it's going to be important for Ai be able to join your meetings. Right? If you if you expect to have an assistant that you expect to have basically a sort of Ai employees, but have to join your meetings. But really, I think although go the long term don't want to think of ourselves as conversation intelligence company one call ourselves as an intelligent company. As crazy as it sounds, we're getting close to Ai that's basically indistinguishable both from humans. I I have four of friends we've used Gpu four and all of them tell me the same thing that telling made basically like talking to it doesn't. So I thesis is that we're basically gonna have Ai employees who when i float around going to absorb all of the information of the company gonna sit on meeting though read every every email i make themselves general useful. And just like a regular employee, I think, you know, these these Ai agents you're gonna be able to find them on Slack to send them emails to invite them to meetings so able to ask them to perform tasks for you. Like employees, they don't work sixty till seventy hours was a week they work media the week. They have enough time to actually see every meeting. Right? And they know everything. Internal and external. And again, it may sound it may on Crazy, like this stuff is actually thing right now. So as far as external consumed, today, we have Gp fifty three and the Entire internet and right book and those every and lot of that was inaccurate, and it knows everything that's external. As far as in Internal no edge is consumed we ourselves that at flow was starting to get a glimpse of what it means to have this kind of Ai absorbing all of your information in Ct on the meeting. That's that's the reason why we've have I've moved this meeting to tim flow today. To to really really quickly, how is the team...

Client 4: Have we talked about this with the team? Internally the shutting down the virtual office, and I'm curious how the how the team's responded.

Host 1: Definitely. Yeah. It's been... It's been a long time coming. It doesn't come surprised. I think like, the the health shutdown is new, but like, it's been a think four months that... Like the team has accepted. We used to it putting it on freeze to keep the revenue it was I think the revenue is not worth saving. The team is responding very well. The team has been fine, but yeah, Thank you for asking. So again, the internal knowledge bit So everybody been playing with Chad Gp in Gp three. People are starting to get a feel of whether means to dock an Ai that has every external note. Internal is a little bit of a of a new experience. So the those two things that I wanna show to you today experiences that we're having today at at. One is i as a leader, Let me share another window here. I am able to raise my Slack window. I I'm able to catch up with basically every meeting that happened in the last twenty in the company in five minutes building day. Because all of these meetings things are recorded.

Client 3: So we're still on your your Google slides by the way I don't know if you mentioned slide.

Host 1: There you go. That's makes exactly that.

Client 3: Yeah. I got it out.

Host 1: So we we have this channel that's called the F hose channel. And so every every meeting summary goes here. So we have this Ai agents that's joining every one of our meetings that's summarizing it the way, we're working with the Deepgram I think, I think the one who introduced me to s the fill space. And then I can see all of these meetings. So actually, Twenty, I had a meeting with Deepgram a few wheels ago. There you go. We're here. So I'm met with Deepgram and so this is a similar of the for useful sales to explain the issue having suggesting taking me scientific approach I need to identify what was going wrong until in socials forth. I now, I take five minutes in the morning in five minutes in evening to catch up on channel. And in ten minutes a day, I have a glimpse of everything that goes on inside the company. That's huge. I mean, it's basically removing communication and collaboration bottleneck inside the company. Very often and and we to see something I'm going to comment on it. I'm like, oh, like, josh in me decided to do that. And then we have like, wait a minute. Like I'm not the line with that. Can we talk about it. Right? That's huge. And then not only can I see these to summarize? The second thing is that can then go. So this is the the page. Again, this is like. It's not a like it's closed.

Client 5: Like the summary is being generated by by exactly what here.

Host 1: December right now is you Right.

Client 5: And then...

Client 5: Well, okay.

Host 1: Go ahead. Perfect.

Client 5: No. There's just not a lot of trained data. So with that level, they can summarize it.

Host 1: That's right. That's like there's like zero shot here. There's no no tuning involved here. Just yet.

Client 5: Got it.

Host 1: Okay. And after that, I can I can go to the details page of that meeting. Right? So this is the recording. So I can see transcript that can watch the recording can it on it people at Enrique. Test. And then most interestingly, you see this chat here. I can discuss with z ai that's basically been sitting on this meeting, and I can talk to it. So what was this meeting about? The meeting improve transcript transcription services such as retraining the model and using multi channel recordings. What was the outcome of the meeting? The discuss solutions to improve accuracy compared performance of Deepgram built and discuss creating a the specifically for the project. When we do to sell again? I couldn't I could go on on it's huge. So we use it also for user results checks. So now I can... Even when I have a chance to attend user results compensation and good like But did he use think of this solution where did did chill discuss solutions accuracy crazy. So you can see, for example, here, I have User results chat for example, K. So K was a dialogue that we're are resulting. So here, I can see the entire summary. And here, I have my decision with them. So what we that you don't think of solution. That was the modem. I did I actually forgot the will I'll see. Olivia phone kicks be creating duplicate contacts in lc crm but that had a good platform with helpful customer service transcription which she helpful. So Again, this is working today. I tell a minute talking about def. Those two questions that I get a lot when I talking about things. They they seem to be on everyone's mind to these days. Make probably not insult to demo or as photos. So question one, what's the mood question to won't hold the value flow to incumbents? People always asking think what's the mood in this in this kind of Ai wave that we're having here. I think the question is a result of all the attention right now is going to the infrastructure layer. That's the way, a little bit of that only time there is a technological revolution Infrastructure layer is the first one to come up it so that's that's the one that gathers the attention fields then think the intra is a little bit more of a commodities than the application layer. A total commodity, but I think that that question is valid for the infrastructure because they're not all these kind of a model he's kind of a model. But they think about the room until no value cruise to the application later. Again, that pattern has existed throughout history. Before pcs, all the attention went to the Semiconductor with failed dialed in detail Before the web, all the attention went to the tel with, like the information to go highway, And now all the information is going to open Ai, but I'm sure you're having a lot of conversations about the application layer. And I think that's the... That's where the the the is going to flow. Why does the value flow to the application there in this case, especially because Just like a a chip just like a Cpu is useless less until you given it an input and an output like a keyboard in the screen, I think a lot language with well is kind of useless less until you've given it the proper input in the proper output. And here the input is the meeting of the document or whatnot and yacht which is actions that you wanted need to perform. So right now, everybody is playing with these large models that easy the Gp three but the kind of prisoners. Right? Like stuck in this text field so the range of actions that they can perform is actually very limited. But the technology in and of itself is incredible. And it is it is today like the technology. Is able to perform actions for people. We're not very far from basically document models being everyone's does small assistant. And being like an employee inside the company. So those are lot of and untapped potential here. The second question that people ask is once the value flow to incumbent instead. And gill sometimes told this story of a... When mobile came about deals were going the sales schools for mobile local of opportunity. And you told out that the Salesforce store mobile was just salesforce mobile app. I think this is different. I think in this case, the product is is different enough that it basically requires applications to be real architect and rebuilt from the ground up. I think it's it's, you know. It's almost like cars versus is policies like no holes cellular was making fortune selling calls. Here it's the same thing. So this example here on the left is Ui pass. Example, adapter. I don't know if... Everyone knows what the debt is doing. I'll just show very a quick video. The built that Chrome extension that you can type anything that you wanna do. And it uses your browser for you. Find me a house in Houston for full until six hundred k. And then you just many place product for you. And you can this one's is actually relevant to us add Max at the at adapters a new lead love this new activity saying that he's thinking about buying one hundred widgets jets. And it's just working. So this is effectively it is effectively performing actions for people. But these are two extremely different breeds of product. Very different grades of software. To meet the same difference, it's actually details in like photoshop There is no... There is no chance that you like that they're gonna have to rebuild them that'll business one scratch to get there. And I think this is a superior product line in many ways. Next steps. Like I said, we'll laying up twenty four percent of the team aged people. I would love some help to find the next thing this, you know, we we we pride ourselves in having an extremely high value when it comes to hiring anyone who gets this before is gonna be extremely okay. The reason is it's mostly go to market functions. For example up everyone in customer success. Will not gonna success we have lay I will support they joint we're gonna lay out one of our reps, you know, we're going to be leaner. So multiple reasons. Again, we'll don't be them. To, I want us to be linear and animal nimble as we again looking for product market fit. Then obviously, I wanna be I will be a good two wheel of everyone's capital here. I've I filled these delay we're gonna have wheels of eight years of runway. Expect this will go down a little bit after we hire a few more machine learning engineers, but we're going to be white capital efficient. Get next steps, although lot the short medium term The one thing we're not getting at is not yet is synchronization intelligence. It's aligned division. We found that values is the strongest use case that will had it seems to me like intelligence today is the one category that was able to create the most value out the Ai. So there's a big does a growing market. There's a highway willingness to pay. And again, it's aligned. Think it takes a lot of sense to fix track the information that leaves in inside meetings. Also I think meetings are gonna be an important front end for what we're going to build. I think pretty soon, we're gonna have we'll be able to ask assistant. We was thinking of calling it zoe. Like, hey, Zoe, Can you please like draft Cc meeting like, ping in one week to remind us of these and insulin on and so forth. So I think makes sense to have this assistant to be able to sit with you on meetings. We don't think of ourselves end of conversational intelligence as being dead sent to, but I do believe to be a piece of what we're going to be moving forward. The term again the ambition is is a lot of horizontal here. I'm generally bud i'm actually fully body into the the the power and the value of vertical businesses and a focus on an Ic and the buyer. Think in this case, though the long term there's going to be one text field. That businesses use they type stuff that they wanna do. Just like there is one text fields that we use go we wanna like, look up something online. Does one google. We don't have the engines. I think horizontal based generally make a lot of sense for productivity tours. I think we'll seeing it recently with notion and alt, and I think before that. Google Apple, you know, everybody uses the same Pc and it's system, we will have your operating systems by knowledge. So again, here the ambition is largely horizontal on. So right, we're doing a lot of refills on what it means to have a horizontal original Ai agent. Sold of agent Google. If you will. Text field where you can type things that you wanted do and that can make companies and people twenty silly fully does more efficient and say them a ton of time doing all of their that doing today. I'll take us a while to figure this out, the one is a a matter of weakness matter of months and quarters. I think because a long time of view exactly the shape of this product. But that's what we're working on right now. super super exactly to be working on that. So your question audio This is mean, obviously, this is the one thing. This is a dream of. This is the one thing that everyone wants to work on right now. Is there any any thoughts of questions or comments more to talk about.

Client 5: So you gonna talk a little bit about the the benefit of having one Ic or one persona to sell to any any new thinking on that You think sales will be our focus. Do we go to more of a It productivity type. Buyer I think short term on the conversation intelligence bit it's going to be sales.

Host 1: Long term I'm still wrapping my head around it. I I think it might be a bottoms up played by the... Maybe again quite horizontally don't. It might be play. I think every employee is going to be the from having this kind of Ai agent helping them on the basis.

Client 2: ...oh sorry.

Host 1: By the way, I I I forgot to show to two quick things. We'll actually We're making a bit of progress building this kind of horizontal agents. So again, this kind be, like a debt demo we we've built. So like I'm looking for a house in Kd Texas with full bedrooms rooms and the Ai is using is right fit and building this The other thing is, I'm in touch with you may know and Sw, the from the... He he founded sent back back in the days, and and now he's a Ceo of help people find the executive assistance. To how I found by my executive assistant. Have, like, nine hundred of them. And I mean, that's him and I'd love to find a way for us to partner there to basically install a piece of software on the executive systems computers and use that to start gathering a lot of data and and training our model with that.

Client 2: We talked about a little bit yesterday flow and be good to discuss this a group here is excited about you exploring this technology and having a smart team kind figure out where there's a nice entry point here and some during white space. I think for me, I look at a team. I think you said it's still gonna be a team of twenty five. And I would just encourage you to think about like, what is our process to defining part market fix. But i get worried about these still big engineering team. Is that you get pressure to keep engineers busy. And then this becomes a feature factory. And I don't like, we just need to figure out like, what is that? What is that wedge? What is an entry point? Where do we create habit and something truly novel and then continue to build advanced functionality around that. And so curious how you wanna kind of from your learnings the first time around, like, think about achieving product of market fit and really directing the team and kind of being ruthless prioritization. Yeah.

Host 1: I I I think this case is slightly different from the first time around because because it's a very deep field. Even if we just decide to build a product that is seemingly as simple as this, which is like it's a text field can absorb this is like a result lab that, like, can absorb like dozens and dozens of engineers. So this is by no means an easy valuable that will unblock at on That said, I I I do agree with you that... yeah, I don't want mean I to reboot again. That is there is a figure model that I'm more cognizant about the time around. Yes. I think you you you also raised some concerns yesterday that I wanna address because they'll valid right? That we're also going to be left with a bit of a good marketing team. So we're gonna have... I think full people one engine manager and and and one product marketing manager and and two aes. They're going to be selling the conversation intelligence solution that we're having right now. So this is, I think ninety percent ready to sell. There is a world in which we're make the look at. In three or four modes. So these four times for people represent the death of roughly a hundred thousand dollars or something like that. I think it's a bad wheel's making because i I I think the expected that that is quite I think this can actually be one of the combinations of that kind of assistant. There is a chance that the that actually pans out and pays for itself and actually start generating revenue from this. And if it doesn't pan out, I think you're at all two ways this bet can go wrong. And i think will find out for months. So either this product is simply not for you to sold and there is not more room in the constitutional intelligence bucket for another entrant. I thought that would be the case, but that is one mode. The second video mode would be our exploration we just filter away from the conversation in intelligence bid. If any of these could almost utilize by the end of the call, I think we'll get deeper and we'll just will just be a lean and mean basically, anywhere.

Client 2: Do you set of, like, working hypotheses and kind of experiments that you can map to each under certain time frame, so we can just keep learning I think there's there's a lot of surface area here, potentially.

Host 1: Do you mean in terms of the good market for the session intelligence of the for the erased the other stuff.

Client 2: I think in general around, like, what is the product scope? That's gonna stand out here. And Who's it for how do we evaluate it? How are they using it? What's the willingness to pay for it? Yep.

Host 1: What's still in the process of defining that. We have we have several things that likes purring right now. So One of these things is again, like the... It's not like an Op pa kind of play. Right? That that is one of the avenues other avenue is almost a little bit of a consumer whole across kind of place. Like the the agency Google play. Right? Finally, the third one is is a little bit more a tab down way where like again, it's it's this but that joins a remit that radio document and and and and makes it itself useful. So those are like three of the different places that was thinking about and resulting right now and h has very print, obviously, go to markets and Ic and everything.

Client 3: Both from my perspective, number one, i I'd like, just taking a step, like I can just hearing in your voice like your excitement and your your focus compared to, like, the last meeting where felt like, you know, we were sort of in a transition time in the business. And so appreciate that. We don't totally out a sense for exactly where we're going at this moment. But hearing your conviction on the path, I think is is really really nice to to hear Where we were before? So I I'd say a few things i. I think it's okay to not a hundred percent know exactly where we're going. I I think do wanna you know, sort of put our foot in the ground and and go at something once we're we're ready to run, it that's a process it takes a couple of months that's okay. I think the the thing that can potentially be demo your the team is having, like a lot of, like just like stops and starts in and lack of direction. So I think as long as you're organizing the team around the concept of Hey think this is a figuring our product at fit time.

Client 3: I think that's great. Then I think once it's like a put put the foot in the ground and go time, just under, you know, kind of clearly articulating to the group, like, sort of this is when those moments arrive. I think to the to the slides around, like, note and differentiation, I hear... I hear points on those things, and I think know, given where we are right now like those aren't, you know, the top concerns. Right? We we should just get focused on, you know, building products that you know, customer love and get value add of and and all those sorts of things. Will say like, I think that it'll end up being Nuance. Right? There there will be some areas that are actually subs, and there will be other areas that are are not. Right? And we can either have a debate on sort where it doesn't make sense for a sort of an existing company to kind of capture sort of most eye in his space versus a new coming. I but I think, like, as we're going through the idea, it's it's worth debating those things like, for example, I don't know. Maybe, you know, you... Raised for example, like integrated Gp three until drafting, like, certain materials, that would like fit and like, a marketing automation campaign. Like, kinda feels like it would make sense where... Like, that's how it disruptive for playing phrase given... You just sort more of like a modular or an application within that's software. And so trying to understand like, hey, what actually feels like a brand net new workflow that an existing system side, you know, going to be able to capture. There will be some things that I think paul in those on both sides. I think it's something just consider we as we go as we go through. Overall I think even just like the demo what you you showed, like, already looks. Kind of really cool and interesting. I I I agree it's some really exciting space to be building things in, it's I checked a little bit me when you need the Zoe comment because I think back to the early days of initial team flow and you know, how much we should have from fives versus versus not, and and now we're in a new and having those same questions. But I I I think it's... All this is exciting separate, but I think the thing I'm most excited about is just your the way that way you're talking about the opportunity and and you're your direction your focus on it.

Host 1: Thank you. Yeah. And and that's that's where my covid boys. By the way, I I am that Frankly. And and the rest of the team is as well. They radio deal. And so I take morale of the very seriously, and I I'm nothing that lightly when I say that I'm I'm I'm not really worried about the Morale of the team in these case. The team team is is actually really jazz to be working on that. Frankly, know, what team wouldn't be more excited to be working on these than own sales enable. Software. They're very excited to be working on this.

Client 4: I'm curious flowed. Just as you've thought about this and and done a bunch of research, where do you feel like there is white based. Maybe from a feature perspective or a form factor perspective or a model perspective in this category, just given there are a couple companies that have material product market fit and do something similar. Like, where do you think the white space is?

Client 4: I think the... Gong. Right? Like that's the big question.

Host 1: Yeah. Think the agent side is the white space here. So like I said, I I don't mean this to be a conversation intelligence company. I think that's going to be one of the ends that we're having in all very happy gong got great business. And I don't think i will ourselves us competitive with them of the little deal. I think one of the big differences again is that we're going to the agent. So basically, after your meeting, the Ai is going to pull full the actions for you. Is going to send the follow email it's going to schedule the next meeting, it's going to update of tasks track for you. It's it's going to do all of these things for you. So in my mind, that is the biggest difference here that we're having Is is is it's a it's.

Client 4: So a combination of what exists today. Is the recorder and the transcribe and then going down the path of maybe real automation is how you phrase it or you know, taking action on behalf, which is why you like the adapt example.

Host 1: That's exactly right. Yes. So I think again, I've view the meeting as just one of the that's used to tracked actions think actions also going to be used, like Slack is going to go on one. Like kevin able to go there. That's to do stuff for you. Right? Like, maybe even i age, maybe whatnot not. Right? And so but I I don't believe the meeting is going to be pretty pulled we've from that an a a pretty good probability for us to own. Because this also a a huge source of knowledge inside the company. I think relatively little knowledge existing side wiki and such like a lot of inside this kind of tool. I was catching up with the notion and saying, I mean, there is no beautiful for Ai to, like, create your wiki for you, right on just in time basis. Wiki will steal the moment when they're written like, heal this actually be a new wiki, like, it knows everything that's going on the company because just like talk do we didn't get sales of virtual business.

Client 4: It's exciting.

Host 1: Just exciting. I'm oh all jazz. I think I mean, this is i I I was telling them yesterday. This is the in my mind, this is the biggest technological of revolution I've seen in my life. Think it's it's more significant than the ind internet. Think just like the internet is going to happen only once. So we're very excited to be at for. Right? Any other questions or anything else that anyone to talk about?

Client 5: So my mind david.

Client 2: Go ahead.

Client 5: We got.

Client 2: I was just gonna ask to put a finer point on kind of the Ic and initial use case starting within sales. I like your vision of, like, the last twenty four hours been captured in five minutes. Like, there's something really magical on that That feels like a manager at sort of view if if I think of who I get this immediate value from that, like, how sort of have my eyes ears everywhere, I think part of the beauty Gong. So is that... Do you think of, like, engineering managers as, like, an initial batch of testers? For this, or how I guess, a little bit more there.

Host 1: Possibly. Let me share my screen again. Can you see this? We've seen we we've done... We've done quite. Can you see this So these are some of the the different verticals that we could go after. So again, sales. You're attracting business slides. Because successful to hand up think it's going to be... If we go after to sales, I mean, cs is the obvious age doesn't see here. Marketing, this is an example of like i quote that marketing manager sent slack a few weeks ago, Hey, Do you all have any good feedback that you can minimize and users as quote about the sales? Like, this is exactly the kind of thing that you could ask just gonna thought Right? I think the results are an for P teams. To bridge the gap between the teams that builds the that the teams that talk to the customers, which is which is way broad today. It's especially big companies. Right? And I I I think as a product doesn't bring this gap to me huge. Like, being able to ask that but, like, hey, like, what are the biggest complaints about the product sets thought the right why are people chilling and so on and so forth, Like, I think that is not of big beauty. The sort of like gong for middle management, I'm I'm in it. I do believe there is no opportunity to coach but just I don't understand why only salespeople people who need to be coached. That seems like an obvious opportunity to me. The other hand, And I work in the everyone's substances on this one. Like I don't think space is very healthy. Actually it doesn't seem healthy to me at don't. I don't understand why companies don't seem to invest done training no managers coaching. So I I don't know that there is a business good meeting here. But yes, is that is one of these things that the product could own things I I feel like the the the the ones thing you was me about though was more about business intelligence and... Yeah. I mean, you know, Brandon in your eyes you just made this investment in a seek, i believe. So I I... Yeah. Doo believe. Bi is going to be another big application here. So I I don't think we're going to do Bi as in we plug into your days, but i I I do think we're going to do the stuff qualitative side of The eye. That's like, hey. The status of this project did the meeting with Coca Cola and so on in su?

Client 2: Thank you My question was actually pretty similar by the way.

Client 5: So just I think the one thing is to the degree we can focus on winning one use case, one persona something like that. I think it's really helpful. Because it Sometimes a challenge was, like, a general purpose vision is like how do you get from here to the promised plan and, like, you know, you, you never do one thing exceptionally well, and that you'd you never earn the right to get to the province plan then sure that kind of you're already thinking about it, But tendency tends to be spreads in versus win something. And so it just keeping an eye that.

Host 1: I I I hear that. I Yeah. I I hear it. That that's something that's on our mind. We were testing think the other than azure eligible example will they, you know, obviously, a horizontal product, but they were able to this through template and mir and notion were able to do the same thing. This is like an embryo of a soft, but, like, one thing that we're thinking about that like, what is the equivalent of template all this kind of business? I don't know yet. But, yeah, that all the discussions all different things together on mind. Yeah.

Client 3: I'll I'll say just just quickly, like, when you were just going through, like, the product that we have so far, like we're out to me was like, that slack channel just of, like, capturing every company conversation and you know, the key points and being able to comment and jump to specific summaries. And like, that seemed to me. I like I I haven't didn't see anything like that. Like, the other things that were more sales centric like me a lot more gong ish, and I get your points around things that are new different in being able to, like, create action, but I just saying you... I've got a friend or a guy note. Dan shipper who I went to pen with. Because, like this guy talk about twitter of, like, a company Librarian, where basically, like you might have, like, in Ai might just like be more but the library of the company, you know, somebody I knows everything or knowledge is or at notice who to ask about something. And so I think that that concept and that. I think also that ant pricing is is interesting. But But that element of the product's out to me that that you were shot.

Host 1: I'll be... I'll be ready for at this very soon. So I'd love I'd love to have you put your hands on it. And do you stop joining you'll you'll speech meetings and so forth. It's it's it's kind of life changing obviously. It really changes how you think of your company. It gives you such an amazing visibility around everything that's being on this is amazing. Great. Right. I I hear everyone's consumed around the Ic and the the vertical thing. Again, I I lean horizontal, but i I I also here this is consumed, and I I I think the value. It was also one of my learnings that tim flow is that I I think we did stop to see things out differently once we started selling it as a built sales on sales teams. So I I I I totally understand that probably going that call focusing on one use case, when I be one buyer. And that that's double mind for me as well doing this results.

Client 5: Yeah. I'm unless have appealed view like if it's proved, truly product then then maybe doesn't any that Right? But if it... If it requires a sales assistant any meeting boy, I think you need some be Yep.

Client 5: Great. And so we you we use team flow charlie Week you're gonna stop using it now?

Host 1: Yes.

Host 1: I bring up more.

Client 5: Can virtual cafeteria and to all of our funny pictures of each other.

Client 3: Right? That's all good know.

Host 1: Brakes breaks my help. I mean, we'll... Well, I mean, we'll obviously use those of each. We don't want it stop using it. So we're even thinking of perhaps an instance on the side, like a rogue instance be surprised if engine did that. So maybe maybe you can you piggyback on that. But, yes.

Client 5: Looking keep our office furniture an and our hard decor we've. Investment a lot of time in my buildings. So everyone feeling about what we discussed and the the the shooting focus I mean, I'm I'm happy to go...

Client 4: I'm I'm very supportive. I mean, I think it was it was pretty clear that the core product just wasn't didn't have a ton of product market fit beyond that core audience the folks who found it and used it and and kept retaining over time. And so I'm glad we're we're shifting This is obviously a state that's gotten a lot of attention over the last next months. I agree with your general thesis around this being a very large architecture where there gonna be a lot outcomes being created and also on the application layer. Being a place where think it's gonna be great to build I I I agree with everyone else set around have a persona focus to start with, and if that person persona doesn't work moving to the next one, but really focusing on one persona. The get even more so at the application layer for something like this. Getting deeply ingrained in the workflow I think is where the value is actually gonna be created, just having a chatbot to, like, summarizes things is did not really my mind where the value is gonna be created. I think it's gonna be getting deeply deep ingrained than one persona of the very valuable workflow. Over many many parts of their workflow And so I think really focusing on the sales use case to start with, makes a ton of sense to me. Think that taking action piece being a differentiator can be a place to really focus. As you're kinda going to market with this in building? I think the core sum transcription pushing that into crm is basically a solve problem. My point of view? I think Gong has solved that problem. But I think the beyond with that, could be particularly interesting. So is my high level dot. Great. Thank you.

Client 2: I think those a good summary. I don't know of a time to edit and that's consistent with what we've discussed in the my point here. I think continuing to just make sure we don't get comm away. Let's solve something very very clear and create habit with a core group of people and and encourage you to wrap experiments around. Like, really get the whole team marching on the same direction around, like, what do we wanna learn this week for this month? And would do we need to do to learn something new to then inform the next chunk of part development door. You know, go to market. Or whatnot not. So really, really just time box things and give yourself some some gonna go back like that route prioritization. I just don't want you to feel this obligation just keep a lot of people busy. I want you obligation to be finding how does market fan real value for an end customer. So I just want you to If you find you're at a point, we're like, okay. The team is too big and I just feel like too much pressure to keep people busy. That's a good time to kind of step back and look at the team and and the process the where you are, make another potential big change. This one you have the freedom to do that. Like, I... I'm not worried about burn. I'm worried about you finding. And worried about prioritization and and focus. That's that's the issue here.

Client 5: Hey maybe me just that ask a question when you said it easy did your concern that the engineering team is maybe too large and that it will and and by being too hard actually will hurt us. In the near term. If you i don't know if you've heard that. Okay.

Host 1: Can you can you hear us now?

Client 2: I didn't hear.

Host 1: Your Is asking if if you're question is whether like the engineering would be too big and that it basically, would closed down and then held us With i insurance what?

Host 1: The engineering team is too big and which threw is down. I I Yeah.

Client 2: I don't I don't I don't have a of prescriptive recommendation of what this team should look like right. Now at this point in time, I defer to you flow. I think it's more of a assessment on what are the experiments you need to run and what do you need to prove? And then if you ever feel like you're just keeping people busy, to keep people busy. Or it's, you know, not the right size team for for what we need to do. And cut more. I just... I want going you'd have to feed them to, like, put this in a box and really you know, be focused on the most important issue not any distractions around it. Yeah.

Host 1: I agree. I I mindful full up that figure as well. My my hope is that the current size we have is reasonable. It can actually lowest to you execute multiple experiments and execute on multiple threads at the same time. But I I I agree you the analogy I used for that by the way is is like prospecting for just digging of mine and operating the mine and, you know, think when you're looking for Pm measure plus for gold. So you only remain nimble and c build lot of ground and and be very fast. And I think if you've built a mind you know, it's it's a full time operation to manage mind. And so it's it's it's a problem. If you're like, spending entire time operating your mind, that's just prospect me prospecting for gold. So I mindful full of that video mode and, yeah. If if I do see materialize in a few months, I'll I'll I'll I'll get deeper.

Client 5: Sounds good.

Client 5: Great. And in so do you wanna wanna touch base every kind of the matter What we're doing every kind of two, three months or six week i don't know may... I mean, might be good to like touch base and more, like six cadence. Just get it sense what the updates are. Or we just have to be call risk. Maybe there's some update on product market that would be nice.

Client 5: Sure.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, would you me... I mean, I these send this these investor emails, what are you looking pool.

Client 5: I I I think it's specifically just on the part market up but you know, do you feel like any progress that we're making there, you know, we could to hear about rapid it sounds to be iterating a lot, so we can give you more feedback on it. But yeah. I I think we're meeting probably a couple from months anyway.

Host 1: We'll meeting it three eight weeks right now.

Client 5: Oh, That's fine. That's fine. That that... That's like cadence time for me.

Host 1: Awesome. Alright? Well, thanks everyone. Super appreciate everyone stats and input, and I'll send everyone the Sales Ai link for this meeting and you'll be able to chat to the Ai about it.

Client 3: Nice.

Client 2: I'm sorry. Thank you.

Client 3:
