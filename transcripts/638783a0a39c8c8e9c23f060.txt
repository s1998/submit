Host 1: Ar is, you know, called outbound. So I am curious to know, it's really why you does Decide take a call and what you're interested in trying to solve today? Or.

Client 2: Apparently my the founder wanted me to take the call, so that was the catalyst. And I sent to you, I think a few of the objectives that we were you know, looking for at this point.

Client 2: Mh. So those are those are kinda the two reasons. We're exploring vendors out there just to get a sense of the landscape and and, you know, your email came at the the right time I suppose.

Host 1: Nice. Okay. Cool. And so you're from what I saw on Linkedin, obviously, seeds stage tram a little bit smaller, You're the only person in, like, the Fp and a role of, like, forecasting, You mentioned forecasting a budgeting and then just like so streamline the process, which we'll dig into that because that is pretty like high level, I would say. But guess I would love to understand. It looks like you've been there for about a year have you noticed, like, inefficiencies or or what was, like, the reason why the founder wants you to look into something.

Client 2: Well, so we've raised just over sixteen million dollars at this point. We've got team of about forty five. We'll be doing a series a early next year. So I want it say we're early seed. Mean, seventy million dollars is in a small amount of sixteen seventeen million dollars is a small amount.

Host 1: Honestly.

Client 2: I've Yeah Yeah.

Host 1: It's definitely an it it could be if you want it to be.

Client 2: Exactly. So as we're preparing for this I think that there is a realization that we don't have enough sort of resources and predictability in the model and I mean, like, the founders don't come from a finance background. I come from don't come from an Fp background. I come from an equity research and more investor relations, communications type of role and managing large teams at large institutions, So this has been eye opening for me, and and there's an a I think a belief that the financial model can do everything. And their financial models in Excel. And it's like, it's cash accounting. It's cruel accounting. It's head count hiring plans. Is that it can't do all of these things. I mean, at least not very well. And there's no integration with that and sort of accounting system which is done through sage intact. Very unhappy with that he would like to go back to Quickbooks. But that's its own another topic. So everything is just sort of operating in a silo, there is a recognition that we need to create budgets for the departments. We need to hold people accountable, we need to be able to tell people what their budget so they need to be able to measure against their performance and sort of where those budgets are. And our single excel financial model cannot do all of these things. And I can do all these things. So I think we're looking for I mean, it's it's it there's kind of two tracks we're looking for software that can help integrate and help provide more predictability into the model and forecasting and, you know, budgets. And then also sort of how we're gonna structure this finance team and department as we grow larger. I don't know if you you probably worked a lot of startups before, I think the at least for software, the focus initially is building the product, which is you know, engineering, which we we are far along the way on that. I mean, it's being used by hundreds of thousands of people, so that's that's spine. It's then a a sales and marketing effort, which is where all the money is sort of going. Fight is not the focus of of where they wanna spend any money. And so it's like Jericho the founder wants all of these things, but It's me doing it and a and a six cell.

Client 2: And so like, I think he's realizing the board as well that that we're going to have to make some investment in in the department itself and a software that we're using and we're kind of early stages of figuring out how that's going to look.

Host 1: Nice. Okay. That's a really good background. And so One question on that because have a couple other questions I wanna ask after afterwards, but are do you how familiar are you with Mo? Because I can definitely do a really quick background spiel. Like I like to do that meetings, but Have you looked into...

Host 1: Have you ever heard about it us for? Have you looked into the website at all?

Host 1: No.

Client 2: Okay. Let's quick answer intro.

Host 1: Let me pull up a little discovery deck. And because a lot of what you're saying definitely does resonate. I mean, are you guys fall directly into our niche, which is pretty much Series seed all the way through series like d startup outside, really haven't invested in finance and need to do, like, three persons work with like one person. And so with the right tool, that really is possible and like, obviously getting a tool, is cheaper than, like, getting head count. So that really is the goal like send out what you can do help you be more strategic that way, you're not spending your time like, data w and doing things that really is not probably worth your pay rate of like, hey, you're spending hours doing this, and you probably be doing you know, fundraising or something a lot more.

Client 2: Yeah. There's i like doing.

Host 1: Yeah. Exactly. That's your background. Cool. So to give a little background into where mo came from. We are newer this face, but really what you'll see in this space is that pretty much all third generation tools, which is like people are starting to call us is are now like we all got gotten around, like, three to four years ago. So really, before then, there weren't anything there wasn't anything on the market it's aside from like, adaptive and the ana plan. That like, really more legacy and a lot more clunky and made for enterprise.

Host 1: Yeah. Are three c founders over here on the right. They actually were among the first finance terms of scale bat team up through extreme hyper growth from like, eighty employees all the way to the thousand worth Ipo and actually tried to implement a adaptive banana a plan, but quickly realize that when their company was growing so quickly and they have to constantly and look at things different ways. And we're asking questions or getting asked questions from, like the board or exact just weren't able to make that total work. So they actually tried both they ripped out both and they actually create the V mosaic at pal here. And so the whole point was to integrate all their tech stock, get into a place where they can really quickly analyze data and didn't have to do all that manual manipulation. Mh So that really is the core what we do is bringing in all your data. You guys are kind of a specific use case because Typically, do bring in Crm Erp Hr, but with your Crm being bespoke. It is something that we can actually do likely later part of next year, because we are gonna have an open Api, but as of right now we do integrate with hubspot Salesforce and pipe drive. I think I I mentioned that to you an email. But to get you guys that full picture, that way you guys can, like, look your pipeline. Do everything. We can still get that data in as far as like your Arr arr data. It's just gonna be over a Cs upload, which we can... It's self serve. So you guys an upload as often as you like. But these two people on One of them is Danny she... Actually, I'll show you the G riviera sent to you afterwards but she is a biz person. So they don't even have a finance person at on her team and really she said, was they gave me superpower because it took out all that, like, busy work she had to be doing and got her to place where she could focus more on the biz ops. And then also we have like, a lot of one person teams or even just like Ceos that are not finance focused, but they needed that skill set before they hired someone. And Mosaic, like fill dot gaps. So whether you're super sophisticated but just don't have time or you are some people we talk to just like, are like, hey, we don't have the head count yet. So we just gonna do this with what we have, definitely feels like gap and helps you guys level up to a better spot with the function. And hopefully, will do everything that you just mentioned as far as like, you know, a cash forecasting and and head account planning and all those kinds of things.

Client 2: Awesome.

Host 1: Cool. Last slide here is just that Like I mentioned, we are newer to the space, but pretty much a lot of these players are, but we've found that as far as action goes regardless this to the right over here, and we are g two's like, highest momentum player. So really growing certainly quickly we also invested a lot of time and energy into the engineering of our products in the beginning. And so we I think we put it a good gear into building a product. So went to market around like twenty twenty, but have grown extremely quickly since then because there's just such a need in the market. So that is my little spiel. But would love to dig in a little bit more. So the first thing I I'm very curious about is are you guys still on cash accounting or you you guys made to?

Client 2: We have crew accounting.

Host 1: Okay. Awesome. That is a good for step. And then as far as metrics that matter to you guys, would love to understand like you guys are obviously meeting on the board. What metrics are most important, are you getting them sophistication and granularity a that you guys want or like, what can be improved with your ice reporting?

Client 2: I mean, I think Arr is the number one metric and I think the financial law... I mean, software is really not that complicated of a business model. It's it's it's kinda pretty straightforward. So I don't think it. I I don't think, but maybe I don't know that there's really any enhanced visit ability you can do or give us with regard to Arr. It's all about you know, sales performance and we're monitoring all the sales metrics and how many calls they're making and, you know, what kind of that return rate is and sort of the average contract value. So we can, you know, with some ease extrapolate, sort of what Arr should be. It's a little harder I think early on because we we do focused on the enterprise clients enterprise contracts are called the nine months life cycles, sometimes they can be up to eighteen months. I mean, we had a ten million dollar contract and that was close to two years. To to get that you know, annual contract to to get that done. So that's hard to build into a model. Those are are clunky. They're irregular, you know, so, like enhanced modeling is not going to be able to say, oh, it's gonna be a twenty one month closed versus you know, a twenty three month close. Over time, yeah, I think you can. As as you build the volume, you you you can, you know, have a little bit more predictive ability, but the you know, the the contract size call it a hundred thousands of three hundred four hundred thousand, I think we we sort of have our hands around that and the the model should... It is giving us the the the visibility we need around sort of that that flow. Okay. So I I don't think that is super imperative, but, you know, there could be other metrics and I mean, within the sales function, there's probably a lot of stuff that we're not capturing or we could capture better we could build into the model know if we're seeing a slowing of of outbound calls or a slowing of sort of people that taking calls or going advancing a second meetings or third meetings, Like, maybe all that could be built in to, you know, understanding the model and where injections are going like, none of that's happening. I said really great siloed. Don't know How integrated all of your the software is and and how sort of real time it it it's able to get insights. So there's probably a lot we don't know, but like our core number is Arr, we're trying to grow that. That's what's gonna fuel the series a. That's what's gonna feel evaluation and like you know, I think we have the best grasp of that as we can.

Host 1: Gotcha. Okay. Let's good to know. And so when you guys are building up your revenue model, it sounds like you're doing almost, like, a mix of individual opportunities because they can be so big. Are you guys doing have like a sales passing model or like, what is the strategy behind that because I'm trying to figure out because Typically, we do pull in from the Crm, like the pipeline and, like, the opportunities and things like that. But like, since we can't do that with your software like, we can pull in, essentially your Arr amount and over Csv. I'll definitely, like, at some point during the Sales cycle bring in our data team like scope out, like we'll be able to do, what we can book bringing it over Csv. But Some... Sometimes our customers will build up like, three year two or three different revenue models like, one will be, like a sales pass build, one will be like a pipeline build, and at least you guys could build a sales pass build off of like, head count and whatnot? Are you guys anything like that today?

Client 2: That's what I have for the excel model. That's what I have is just it's head count and here's know, we expect them to drive this much business per year, the ramp for a salesperson is whether it's six to twelve months depending on of what they're in market they're targeted on. And then how long it takes to get a deal done and so those kind of variables go in. Sort of efficiency, like, we're not assuming every salesperson is gonna be and a hundred percent, maybe, you know, we average it eighty percent. So that sort of drives the Arr. On the other side of that, which they don't necessarily align is the pipeline. And I sort of do my own analysis on that. It does not feed the model. It doesn't come into the model, but sort of for our sanity, how much is in the pipeline, how long has it been in the pipeline mind. What stage is it in the pipeline How many months has it been there, and and that's more of a tool, I think for our sales leadership to to you know, keep their hands around things.

Client 2: I like to look at it and I talk to investors. To say that it gives us some visibility or increase visibility into some of the projections that we're running. You know, we have seven million dollars of Arr in very late stage pipeline, and we have you know, some assurance that not those deals are gonna close, but some of them are gonna close. We can say, yeah, we would fact that if there's seven million in the pipeline, at seventy five percent or greater, we're least gonna get a million Arr in the next three, four months. But this is very, like, you know, kind of a finger in the air. Like, it it doesn't have a lot of precision, but it does give like a confidence interval around being able to deliver on some of these things. But it's not all I would... I'd say it's not it's not driving the model and it's not driving our assumptions. It's more of like salespeople use it for their their purposes. The financial model, I try to make conservative because I'm conservative by nature. And it's kind that's all it is. So it's not all integrated to to your point.

Host 1: Gotcha. Okay. That's that's good to know. So will be a little bit of a... different kind of demo just because I wanna be cognizant us in of like, what we can do today versus what we enough pull in versus what might wait till later.

Client 2: And just up an Api. That's next year you're thinking like.

Client 2: So we were in almost now or in twenty twenty four.

Host 1: Twenty twenty three. Yes. So it should be later half, like, probably q three of next year.

Host 1: Okay. Is interesting. I'm taught crm companies forums. Sometimes even though they had their own Salesforce, like, oh it's for, you know, a different kind of niche, but, yeah, you guys have when they actually used yourself, which, you know, is a good customer.

Client 2: We have to use it to sell it and believe it.

Host 1: Right? Oh yeah.

Client 2: I.

Host 1: And as so as far as like your off because we definitely can help with, like, all the more financial driven stuff. Op head account, things like that. How is that as far as, like, predictability and just of accuracy in general.

Client 2: I don't like it. It's... I I I think Jericho or founder very unhappy with our accounting provider. You know, when we brought them on board, it was this Yeah. And and we... You know, look we learn this. Salespeople are very different than the actual once the product is being used in place, I mean, this accounting firm is supposed to be strict strategic and consultative and, you know, all this great stuff and, like, they're so terrible. The books aren't closed till like sometimes twenty four days into the following a month. You know, so there's big delays there. There's not an alignment of line items. So things are just not captured the way, like the way a model's built versus the way they are accounting for them. And on that same one way is right or wrong, but but the reconciliation just doesn't happen. You know, like it's it's just very, very clunky and what I end up doing is just grouping a ton of things into, like, a catch all line item in the model that's like, other other expenses by department. You know, and so that you can't predict I... Oftentimes i'm in doing it just as a G and A. I kind of throw things in G and A and it's as a percentage of on Arr. And you know, when when things are like, early in growing fast, it sort of doesn't matter that much. I mean, I think the head count is the primary driver of our operating expenses. And, you know, that's not the most complicated thing to model. I mean, we know salaries, we know some sort of accrual for you know, bonuses and such, we understand our health care costs relatively. So like, that kind of stuff is fine, but as you do grow and scale and you begin to do more client entertainment and you do have other things going on at maybe multiple office locations the model is gonna be more important to be able to predict the expenses. And like I don't think that we are there yet. There's there's reasonable accuracy, we then call it ten to fifteen percent. But this goes back to budgets. The the engineering team is hired three people because there's opportunities in the market. There's, you know, layoffs and whatnot. So we're hiring people. Well, what's their budget? Where is this money coming from? You know, like, no one's like, you were just sort of, like, I and I don't deny they were probably great hires. I got I'm sure. But like, I we could no one could tell them no because if susie said, no, it's the budget, well what is the budget. We don't have the budget.

Host 1: So it's like.

Client 2: cool, we can do this but, like, a certain point, you you can't you need to have structure around these things and process because it's just sort of to loose goose right now.

Host 1: I got it. Okay. And is that happening would, like, software spend to, like, it's like, the sales team just like, buying stuff and you're like, hey, marketing you know, if you knew what your budget was, you would know this was like, either not good or or you could do it?

Client 2: It is and, you know, it's funny. Like, I I went through... I just wanted to know what all open software did we have. And so like, we're paying for this was... We eliminated some of this by, twenty seats for Linkedin, advance or whatever. We have like two Hr people. We don't need twenty seats. You know. And and so like, there are a lot of these kinds of things or people... We had our our largest customer is the largest bank in Russia that this was the ten million dollar deal. So in sanctions on Ukraine because of the war how and in February, we lost all of that revenue. So we had to go through a big restructuring. It was really intense. So, like, we were scaling up to be, you know, a hundred person firm by now. And like, we had to, like, really back away and lay people off. So there know a lot of layover from that, I guess of, like, seats that we hit purchased on software accounts planning for this expansion or all we're gonna need it, we might as well buy this now. We get a discount. There's a lot of that clean. So I wanna say we're like sloppy. But, like, there's no There's no budget. There's no sort of oversight. Like, why would someone worry about paying for extra five seats a month in their department that may only be five or six hundred dollars. Okay. Like, that's not a lot of money. But like, suddenly, if you're kind of year in bonuses is being tied to it or hey, if you clean that up, five or six hundred dollars a month you could use on something else, you know, I think there's a lot more accountability. Like, right there's no there's no measurement of that. And so gotcha.

Client 2: I think that that that would be very insightful for me. And like some of this is, like, being penny wise and pound foolish, you know, like, the in the scope of things, some of the... Some of these line items are really insignificant. But I think it makes a person more disciplined in the decisions that they made. If they know that there's some sort of measurement against what they're spending what they're spending it on is it being done the most efficiently as it can?

Host 1: Yeah. I totally got that... I mean, like, I know for me at every i'm. It's always like, hey, how strict does my? Like, you just never know, and it's like do it until someone tells you know.

Host 1: So definitely wanna real let in and just like get more transparency, so finance isn't like a black box.

Host 1: Yeah. So did sage come with the new accounting firm, You guys run Quickbooks part of that, or was there a reason why you guys can stage?

Client 2: So, yeah. That was the preferred vendor of the new accounting firm, which is sort of a it's a national firm. It's not, you know, like at a at a enterprise enterprise level national firm, but it's it's sort a mid tier national firm. Their preference was sage. They... you know, they made a comment that no companies go public that are on Quickbooks, and that may be true. But we're probably three or four years from going public, and there's a lot of companies that have done series a b c d, and they're still in Quickbooks and they transition to sage right before they go public. You know, like, i think that we were put on it free prematurely. It it I will give them credit one because we had all these operations in Russia. We have lot of revenues in Russia and throughout Europe in general. And so sage was helpful. In currency translation at multiple locations out of dom outside the Us. Don't think the Quickbooks has those capabilities. So I mean, I wasn't here when we there. I wasn't part the fur or part of the organization when these decisions were made. I'm trying to get them some credit of why it might have made sense to go to sage.

Client 2: But I find the software so outdated and clunky the reporting is terrible. I mean, it's like I'm stepping back to, like, twenty o five or something. You know? I I mean, I blown away that this is this is sort of the software that's supposedly people use. I mean, I think Quickbooks I've not used it here, but I seen the interface, and it seems to be much more intuitive, much more like able to do what we need to do. So at some point when we switch accounting firms, I can see is transitioning back to Quickbooks at least over the course of the next three to four years, and which point we might have to go to sage or other one of the providers, But but it it's not... It it would not be our preference. Do you support sage or do you support Quickbooks or what do you Yeah.

Host 1: If we did support you guys, I would honestly, like, let you know beforehand because the you're integration is super important. But however sage is actually it's on our website yet because it's It's we're in beta with them right now. Trying to get the integration. To be fully flushed out. We actually have five sage customers are helping us do that. But depending on your timeline, like, you guys would either have full functionality, or if you're like, hey, we want this for our twenty point three budget. If you guys would be more of like a beta customer that's another question I had about time. However, you guys did move to Quickbooks because it does sound when you guys have, like, subsidiaries and consolidation. And that is a good reason to go to sage. Until you meet mo because we actually do all the consolidation for So we're actually able to help delay people moving to a Sage during week because we have that functionality.

Client 2: Awesome. Okay. You know, that's great.

Host 1: That that's like a real... Like, if you guys did move to another time firm and move back to quick like what do you think the time on that would be.

Client 2: I'd like to know that myself, I I don't be to jerk with that response But I find that it becomes, like urgent and so I'm out interviewing and trying to talk to different accounting providers and and, like, figure this out, and then they're all like, on harassed me emailing calling all the time like, where are we the decision? And then it's like crickets from Jericho, because he's moved gone to another priority and this goes back my earlier comment, like, my accounting is never just never receives budget until, like, it just it has to.

Host 1: And so...

Client 2: Yeah. Don't go. Two months ago, it was, like highly urgent. We're getting... We're leaving this firm and we got to find a new solution by early twenty twenty three and we're now what I mean, December is, like, around the corner this week. And I... It's not happening in early twenty twenty three. But I interviewed three or four providers that I really like. And, you know, I think that we could make a decision relatively quickly Should we do that. And I think when we do make a decision, all of them prefer Quickbooks for sure sage. So we will make the transition back Quickbooks I'm quite confident in that. I don't know what the exact timeline is gonna be to to to move over on.

Client 2: Okay. The other thing is it the series a sort of keeps becoming not delayed, but we need to have a minimum threshold in our Arr to to where we feel like the evaluation is is gonna be attractive for existing shareholders and and current employees, etcetera, We're right on the cusp of that. You know, we have a thirty million dollar deal that is in like, late stages in the buy client that would be game changing for us. It would provide enough capital that could even, you know, say, hey, we don't need to do the series a right now. But that might not have until next year might not happen at all. We got a one point million dollar contract that is like, close to signing. I've been telling people it's, like, almost done for two weeks. It's not happened yet.

Host 1: Fingers crossed. Person it.

Client 2: Yep. So like, like I I've I've worked with oli sales people like, I roll my eyes is I'm like, sometimes it just such polishing how you wanna say something, but like, that's what they do. But I try to be un conservative. You know, I try to be very transparent it honest and and and as real as I can be. Like, all these deals are right on the cusp. If if a couple those deals hit, then I think we could be ready to do a series a because we have the Arr or not even need to do the because they are so great for one of these big contracts. Equally if these things get delayed because of the economy and decision making slowing down, and this becomes a February march April kind of thing, then the a is aren't gonna get done for a little while. And so I think the concern is we don't wanna switch accounting providers and all the, like, the software that goes into that right into the a and the data room and the due diligence. Like, that just seems like a recipe of for disaster. So I suspect Jericho wants to get done with the a or have that like, wrapping up before we switch accounting firms. Now it becomes such thing that we don't need to do the a for another six, seven months, will then why not get this going and and integrate and move forward. So I think that's... I mean, I haven't discussed this in that's with him, but I think that's what sort of the the back and forth is that we're trying to narrow in on when this is gonna happen. He's telling people it's gonna be early next year as I told you it's almost December, so It's not gonna be January. I'm telling people it'll be first quarter of next year. I think that's pretty realistic.

Client 2: Mh. A slipped to early second quarter, but but that's sort of my timeline So I suspect that we would wanna be on board with someone by call it April of next share.

Host 1: I think that's. So Would you wanna wait until you guys switch back to Quickbooks to get something like Mosaic or would you wanna start with sage and then swap out? Like, I guess, is the timeline for the Fp tool aligned with the the migration or is it before or after?

Client 2: That's a good. That is a very good question.

Client 2: I don't have an answer for you. I'm I'm like my brain is going on there directions thinking about this. I suspect I suspect we will want Quickbooks not sage. I don't think we wanna integrate with sage. Because I suspect gonna be within a few months period. It seems like a a big headache for integration. Especially a beta situation to get board with sage, a tool that we know we don't wanna use.

Client 2: Yeah any the other accounting providers don't really wanna support. To get that and then to make them another transition to Quickbooks, I suspect it would all come with the Quickbooks transition.

Host 1: Okay. Well, one thing to note, I mean, whether it's gonna be Sage or Quickbooks, our integration process is probably, unlike anything that you've experience because you're literally just log your admin Credentials, kinda like how you connect your bank to, like, I don't know or something, and it all us through. So that is, like, aside from Hr or easiest integration. However, it's good to know. So I guess we are coming out with a lot of big product updates in December And So if it is a farther our decision, like, I don't wanna show you the product and then be like, hey, we have all these new things. And we could, but I am curious, like, does... Do you wanna move to a demo now? Would it make more sense later? And then also like, what other companies are you looking at? And are you doing demo stages with them or, like, is that process of like?

Client 2: No. We have not done a lot of demos Jericho Might have on his own, I don't know. I was on vacation last week and I got this email. He's like, this looks cool. You should we should check it out or something camera remember the works. Exactly. So he may be doing this on his own. I don't fully know all the things that Jericho is has his hands in, sometimes he's very knowledgeable about something. I'm like When did you ramp up on this? You know? I so I I don't wanna you under over speak, but myself, I have not done much of this.

Client 2: Jose. Person I spoken with. I think Jericho, we're both learning that like the accounting firm that we are using, I think they sold themselves as bookkeeper, but they're really an accounting provider. They're not bookkeeping. Bookkeeping is its own or of special thing. I think they do a lot of audit. I think that they do tax planning, you know. And so they, like, oh yeah. Bookkeeping, we do that. Well, bookkeeping is a sort of its own thing. You know? We need a bookkeeper. We don't need... I would we also need statements and we need our taxes file at some point. Those are services, but but this is one firm, can't really do all those things well. I... I'm sharing this because I think this financial plan analysis is the same. When I got on board, Jericho sort was under the impression, this accounting firm they're handling all of that. And all I need to do is just sort of come in and sort of look at things and help advise it's like that that's not also not how it works. You know? They you you need whether it be software or a team to be working on this sort of this analysis of making projections and running budgets. And so we're learning along the way, I guess is what I'm saying. I think that I think we need a a solution that helps us not have to build out a huge team. I don't like having all the outsourced individuals. Like that's sort of what the accounting thing isn't just not great. I mean, they don't know what's going on. So it's like me, just trying to piece everything together. I we comprehensive software solution that that at least it begins to give us the the the data and the analysis and the projections that we need to make better decisions And I think this helps Jericho feel more comfortable of, hey, this is a department Worth investing head count in because we have these tools. They're giving us good answers here's what more head count could do. I I think it's a better message. So I know that that a long answer, but we're learning along the way that probably not a one stop solution. And and and sort of good integrated software with predict helps us give more predictability is is essential.

Host 1: Yeah. And so I wanna pull this up because do not have no seven o'clock by the way if we go over, like i don't know i don't even know what we're booked for, but I just wanted to give you that heads up.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it would we did go a little over, but I also don't have one. So I appreciate that. So I guess, you think it it makes sense to do a demo now? Or do you think it should be something that we we hold off low because I can go either way, we also do have like a a webinar style demo, that's, like more general. But happy to do one. I just don't... Like, I don't wanna do it too early and then you forget, and then I is tons of time.

Client 2: I mean, I'm curious what like, what the product looks like or what? Like, if it units on two minute kind of for a minute, just I see, what does it look like? What kind of things is it pulling in what some of the predict projections it it does. Yeah I don't really know what it I I'm embarrassed sorry didn't look at your website.

Host 1: No It's okay.

Client 2: Can't lag, an intense vacation. That this work don't seem to go.

Host 1: Good I normally would be doing.

Client 2: So it would be good to see, like, just graphically what what what the the software looks like.

Host 1: Okay. Cool. Yeah. I can... Let me pull the the demo environment here. And normally for a demo, I bring my solution and engineering and he like has full finance background investment banking.

Host 1: But... Yeah, why just do a a little fly by just to kind of orient you on the tool.

Client 2: Yeah. That'd be great.

Host 1: Cool. You my screen.

Host 1: Yes. Okay. Awesome. So we have our with demo company right here. And a couple things to point out is that there's a a lot of different spaces So Mosaic is supposed to really span everything from consolidation forward to help you guys get to a place where hey, you have your books. Obviously, how be done in your accounting system, But however, we actually do help out with getting those enzymes. But there's a personal space and then really to get you guys started a little bit more quickly well, in the personal space, you can Let me just pull up this, for example, you can really pull up any metric here just make a dashboard really easily self serve. You can also use this as like a scratch pad or really however you want, the beauty of the tool is that we have all these out of the box metrics. That are specific to Saas. So this is really a big differentiator for us. Whereas large the companies out. There, they are really focused around, like, just Fp and a general. We hone ourself into Sas. That way, we can get you all your sauce metrics. All of your like, sales capacity or on... So efficiency metrics and everything that or asking for, really out of the box. So if I want to pull up, let's say, like, arr arr changes, and then even air per head because we have all those different systems can get to that number really quickly and easily. That's. All these calculations are accustomed to your guys business. So we're not like saying Hey, this is your new arr calculation. We are gonna just configure this. That way it matches out how you wanna see them.

Host 1: Right. No. Can make this really bored ready add in different ties here as well. So, like, if you wanna look this by industry, for example, Just slip it pop this out for, let's say, product line, can look at it a bunch of different ways. And then also can drill in and see what the contracts are and and who's actually making up that number.

Client 2: And would this all pulled in from Salesforce is that traditionally where it would or the the other zero?

Host 1: Typically, yes. But we can get this data over Csv. All we need from you is like a schedule of, you know, your revenue and, like, your customer and also like, any of the the tags here. Yeah. Because typically, we pull in all of these attributes from Salesforce.

Client 2: Okay. That makes sense.

Host 1: But then some of them are like, I don't know if you just saw the cohort data there. We should be, and that will just be because we have the start date and the end of the contract. Can bring that all in and then show you cobra analysis.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Okay. Then, of course, can look at this really any which way any day range. something that you you mentioned that I think will be really relevant for you is that because we're and all that data. And if you guys are using department tags, which sounds like you probably are asian we're being quickbooks. This is I think would be really useful for you is we have the ability to share out any of these dashboards that we create with anyone in the business. So we don't have a a per head license fee. It really is, hey. Use mosaic and help finance not be a black box? And so you can actually create these individual dashboards for every single person on the team. And actually, I'd like this view better personally. So you can write notes and takeaways here your department heads can like see their budgets, they can drill in, they can see, like, expense changes.

Host 1: Because we have goals that show like, hey, here you're schools for the next, you know, month or quarter. And then also see hiring as well. So if I come down here, we can see, okay, we have four contractors, we have thirty eight full time, wanna get to, you know, this number, which is forty five. And what's the variant. So, like, how many people can you hire and and why?

Client 2: Where is the head count information coming from?

Host 1: Yep. So we actually pull in have an upload going right now to the demo instance, but we would actually pull in from your Hr system. Remind what you guys use zen.

Host 1: Right Yeah.

Client 2: Everything you have benefit.

Host 1: Okay. Yep. Yeah. So we have benefits. And we're that also... So everything on this side of the tool, which I'm now canvas right now is like, a visualization, We have all those pre made dashboards where you can like, see for example, like, cash flow analysis. Really important right now, obviously, so Showing your cash flow statement, your net burn on a weekly basis, you wanna see it that way, and just see like, hey, what vendors are paying you? What vendors are you guys paying? But this all just a visualization, and you can also swap any of these flipping over to a different dashboard here. Two... Actually, let me go to this one. To a table. So, like, if I wanna see my arr swap it to a table, you know, finance people if we'd like to look at it like this, whereas everyone else see like a Rose calms view. Can definitely do that, like, more investigative analysis. But All the projections are made on the forecasting tab. So the the difference between mosaic and, like a Bi tool is like, Bi is to like, past and present. You don't get the forecasting ability. Mosaic lends it all together. And then that's where on, like, a full... Let me see here. Executive output deck. So Oh here. Q business update. You guys could have this on, like, whatever date range you want. And then make it so, hey. These are always updating for the last quarter. Right in your nose notes and takeaways, but all the numbers that you need to present on your board deck just there for you.

Client 2: Eliminate the need to have an excel financial model.

Host 1: That's the goal. Aside from anything that's, like, ad hoc that like, amazing.

Host 1: Yeah. So all these projections like the expenses and the Arr is done. On this side of the tool, when we're creating all those projections. So this is really the game changer Doing now.

Client 2: Is there a solutions that's doing all this partnering with us to build this out Like, how does that process work? Because I not, like, twenty two anymore. I'm forty two. And so it's like, be a model monkey and do all these things. Like, it it's just it's not what I my strength is.

Host 1: So...

Client 2: No. You have... How does that process work?

Host 1: Yeah. No... And this is really the game changer for, like, not using, like, there's... If you're looking at tools out there, there's a lot of, like, spreadsheet plugins, they still keep me spreadsheets. You still have to, like, do everything right there Yeah.

Host 1: This is extremely different. So if we click on new model here, all I do is, you know, create, like, Jason's model. Mh. And then I choose my actual through date. And so we're... Because we're integrated with whatever it is, sage or Quickbooks, we're pulling in everything down to, like, the transaction level. And we're bring that model from the ground up. So if I choose you, okay. October is my actual through date, I wanna forecast for my next year's budget. I literally just click create and mosaic is taking every part of, you know, your head count, existing head count from benefits, your Gl and your all your transactions from your different source systems and then creating you a three statement integrated model, that is gonna be driven based on best practice drivers and not formulas. So They out in like, fifteen seconds.

Client 2: Another question, so we have investors all the time, which I hate them looking at the model because it's just too massive and complicated. And it's like they're drilling down to things that are not relevant or, you know, but whatever. You give an investor model and they're gonna like, do whatever Wants to see a model how did... What do you send to them? What do you what tool... I mean, how how would someone use this to to sort do their due diligence on the model.

Host 1: Yeah, a couple of different ways. Anything in Mosaic, whether it's a metric or even a model can be exported into an excel or Csv.

Host 1: So like, this is the model that I just created in a couple seconds here. We have all these roll ups. So just like you were saying I put everything into, like, other G, we create these roll ups over the top. That way, you can just kind of organize self. But then you your gl underneath. You can always export this, and it'll show... So if I go into your software and subscriptions, I can configure this to let's say be like, white department. And then it will break out that gl by each department. And then here's where you don't have to do the formulas anymore. So we just have best practice drivers. If you want to forecast out sales and marketing based on a per head basis, we it.

Host 1: All of your head count you build your head count plan a Mosaic as well. That way for the forecast, if you have, like, three higher, it'll project that out and have a dynamic average based on how you guys wanna be projecting that.

Client 2: So exciting.

Host 1: Yeah. So I can click in here see your actual you can even do better level forecasting. You can do this on, like a jail account level if it's like more general spend, but really have a lot of different flexibility here. And they can also stack forecast on top each other to be like, hey, we wanna forecast out like, Salesforce individually or Linkedin individually, but then for everything else, let's just do a per head basis.

Client 2: Yeah. Oh, oh, that's nice. Yeah. Because That that's very useful that that is Okay.

Host 1: Cool.

Host 1: Yeah. So It should make modeling and, like, creating your department had budgets, into a breeze. Like, obviously, you're starting have to do it. We're not doing this for you. We're gonna you on the tool and help handle you through the whole process, but that's how that piece works and then to flip back kinda going backwards into head count. Just a really good visualization of all of your head count and white for your existing head count is from. Anytime this changes, we're gonna prompt you with the reconciliation to be like, hey, you know, let actually go in here or too. Think I have one. So if you have a higher start in benefits and you had someone forecasted, we're gonna show you he had have forecasted Cs for this amount and these the date. We actually had this person start. Maybe they have a different salary different start date. You just ashley's these up and it'll replace them in your forecast. And anyone who didn't start, Well, get prompted with, hey. Do you wanna postpone stone or remove this person? So I'm just gonna remove them. And then anyone who left the company, will ask if you wanna backfill them or have great.

Client 2: This is fantastic.

Host 1: Yeah. So that's, like, the first step of your model Is just getting that all to date. And then The top line planner, is gonna be more relevant once you guys get your like, salesforce or your Crm m grade. But the way that this works is that it is just like an integrated spreadsheet. So if I want to pull in any metric from the metric catalog can do that. And so for example, if I want to bring in my head count, for example, I can do that and then filter this down to like, Aes to start that sales capacity build. So, like, filter are down like, account executive or whoever. And then you can actually use your actual in the forecast period or create method. So just to give you a look at what this looks like. Here's an example of a sales capacity build. Where we're bringing in our total Eighty head count we have our ramped Aes as well, which is essentially just, hey, who has started and, you know, are they ramped ramping. And then we're actually building out this ramping booking waterfall? No cool. This is nice.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Exactly one excel. It's like just it's a it's a heavy lift.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. That's what we hear. Like, our waterfall functionality came out in the last two months, and it was a game changer. Because, essentially, we have this index tab. We have, you know, ram schedule you know, case down case, bad.

Client 2: Oh, I love this. He's... Yeah.

Client 2: Great to talking my language. Oh my god.

Host 1: I love that. And then you can just change it here. So if I I'm looking at the down right now if I wanna do upside ramping. I just change it. It updates that waterfall. And now you can look at scenario by scenario. And then actually compare them side by side.

Client 2: This is really nice. How much does this product cost?

Host 1: It's a good question. So it don't wanna quote you right now because we are changing pricing in the New Year. And the reason for it, is so I'll i'll ...I'll explain now I'll tell you what we're costing today, but really quickly, I just wanna show this. This is pretty amazing. So once you create all these different scenarios. Like, this is an example here. We have like a baseline heavy head count downside upside, you can actually compare them side by side to show, like, Hey. In this scenario, if we do hit, you know, a huge thirty million dollar deal, how does that affect our customer count? Our cash balance, etcetera, do we really use you that fund raise? And so having all those downstream metrics just automatically calculated for you, so you're not managing three or four different spreadsheets.

Client 2: And great for board packets as well. I mean, this is this is just super useful. Information.

Host 1: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So obviously, really fly my demo, but I think you see what the power of the tool. So today, I mean, you guys are kind of in use situations. So let me actually just pull up an example here. So I have review which I talked to you yesterday. And then I also have it was another one. Let you pull up Lumen i. Four you know, find it. Let me just pull up my drive here. So The reason I bring up too is because we do have different... Oh, this actually Doesn't. Customer as well. But let me pull up a normal customers. So we have Smb pricing tiers and then also just like typical pricing and Smb is seed stage or under thirty five employees. Technically guys c stage even though you're a little bit. Like, more advanced than that, but I wanna show you, like, our typical pricing versus our or Smb pricing. Our typical pricing, is thirty two thousand, if you have billing, if you don't have a billing tool on a thirty thousand billing create some complexity. And then twenty four five for analytics only. Sorry. Should go through this first. The bundle is everything. It includes everything as far as, like, analytics, and forecasting everything in between. We do have an option for analyze only. So no forecasting. So probably not interesting. And then we have a five thousand dollar implementation fee. So really just a one time fee. We don't charge for hours. This price is all in. We don't do by head by scenario by data. And that's where is gonna be changing is in the New year because we are supporting, like, up like series deep customers that are really complex and they're getting a lot of eye the tool. But we kind of, like cap ourselves on Ac lee. We are going towards a more based model where depending on what you want. Are gonna be paying less or more? I don't think the price point will get to ever below like twenty like low twenties.

Host 1: Yeah. So if you are our Smb customers, this is where it lands just because typically you're less complex there's less than implementation. So a little bit of a discount on implementation time as well as, like, honestly, a much smaller starting point for the full bundle here. But it obviously is all negotiation. But this is likely ending February of next year. We haven't gotten full firm as far as, like, when our pricing really changing because they're still working on it right now. But it's gonna move away from that all need model where if you do sign up before, you know, some or whatever it changes, you get all the full functionality moving forward. And all grades. So definitely a very powerful tool, but still a lot less than like a high higher of course.

Client 2: Yeah. That's it's that's I'm sure how you priced it and thoughtfully. So And if you're interested in in just like keeping tabs on like, what's happening.

Host 1: We do have this product released webinar coming up, we're gonna go through some new big updates work we're getting. So I'm really happy to say that, like, even like, even though we are... We do have, like, some extremely powerful tool. We're still really product focused. Like, we only have five salespeople people here and we are supporting Yeah. So a lot of or not that many salespeople people but a lot of engineering a lot of products and cs. So coming out with new product extremely quickly, which is why I was I don't wanna sell the tool for it because by the time you're ready to get started, we probably will be leave and bounds ahead of what we're doing right now. And so just knowing that, you know, things can change pricing and change, the demo might change a love it, and we might have more offering. So definitely wanna redo demo what you and the pricing or the timing makes more sense.

Client 2: Well I'd like Jericho and maybe the Michelle or the michelle Jericho Founder of Michelle are our our sort of Coo slash head of people to be involved in this as well because I think the tool... I mean, everyone is, like, They come to me wanting the solution or this answer Like, for head count, I'm like, I don't know. I don't do head count. You know? I mean, like, Like, that that's the business. And that like, everyone's like, pointing fingers that who, you know, information that they need to to do their job. And I feel like This could do a lot of things. It could help in the head count planning. It can help the budgeting it get i'd like to bring some other people into the call when the time is right and see mean, the demo you did for me was wonderful. Like it it got me excited about the product, which I think was purpose of this.

Client 2: But to customize for us and our needs and allow you to engineer to kind of have their hands on it to to make it a proper demo.

Client 2: With with the appropriate people. Why we should do that. But This at least gave me enough understanding of what of how this would help make my life a lot easier and a lot of other the people of the organization. And solve some of the problems that we're facing right now and to understand a bit of the seen and and just how to think about that. So it's been an extremely useful time... A use of time for for myself.

Host 1: So... Good. Okay. Perfect. I'll send you some follow up. And also, I do wanna share out with our G two reviews, because they really are our customers are... See someone said they superpower. I guess I can't buy anymore. But one person said like, oh, it's because I'm not in the right section? No. Yeah. So someone said like, hey, you don't need to do your on your team. If you Mosaic. Oh here. Yeah. So definitely can help extend out, you know, the amount you're doing and help you do things that are more impactful for the business, but looks like I need to i need to, find that review, I'll send you screenshot of it, but I'll send you this and just a couple other things just hold you over. But when would be a bet, like, a better time to just check it and see if timing better.

Client 2: How about check in... Would say early next year?

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: January. Yeah. Early January would be great. I mean, I I won't You're not a vendor that I'm like annoyed with and I don't wanna deal with. And so if you reach out to me in a week or two, I'm not gonna be, like, oh, my God reach out to me. Reach out whenever, you know, you feel is appropriate in your own cadence and cycle. I can't imagine we're gonna be implement any of this in December. Although I don't know, so I kinda feel like January might be a good realistic time. But I'm going to talk to Jericho about this at our next sort of touch point, which I suspect it'll be today or tomorrow.

Client 2: And bring it up. And so probably get an immediate reaction of like maybe like, oh, this is cool. I like to see a demo in which case I would reach out to you and say, This is more fast track than I had anticipated.

Client 2: Might be a thing of, hey, this sounds great. I need you to focus on this right now. Which to... Then January is probably a more realistic time. So I'll have some kind of initial feedback within the week.

Client 2: And then but, like, for you kind of planning purposes putting some of your calendar early January be great. But I will plan to follow by email later this week and sort of give you some feedback.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. I mean, if if you do hear anything from Jericho, then we can definitely kick started because there is a benefit to getting started within this year, even if we push out implementation, but the counting thing is definitely like a big piece to think about so I totally understand that. But all I continuing to send you just like, great information. I will say that our website has a wealth of resources It's far it's like Templates, waterfall templates, term of account templates, if you want your start out over again.

Host 1: So take look at it. I'll send you things as they come out, just know, to keep the expression to share resources, but, yeah, I'm we can definitely plan for that.

Client 2: Yeah That would be great. This was an extremely useful call.

Host 1: I I can hear it.

Client 2: Yeah. Let's let's see where things can go from here.

Host 1: Awesome. Well, have a great rest of your week, Jason, great meeting you and speaking and you yeah Hopefully, you know, if if you guys do wanna things I'm here, so my it is open.

Client 2: Really appreciate it.

Host 1: Thanks for your time. Good. Talk
