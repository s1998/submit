I'm really excited to connect with both of you and hopefully have a new Uk partnership, Anything that keeps that that... Yeah. Gets tom's orbit in the Uk, especially with the mission like yours it's extra exciting.

Client 5: Yeah. And that's me. So, Ai.

Host 1: Yeah. Hey, Lad. Thanks. Thanks for for joining. Introduced it to to Bill the ceo of orbit, but Yeah. Good to get everyone on here and interconnected.

Client 5: Yeah. I appreciate it. I mean, this same is so much great. Things about yourselves. So Stopping just to see what the fuss it out.

Client 3: And okay.

Client 5: I'll take a look at your deck. I I think we agree that is that you have some exciting functionality. That's left for me as well. That's gonna be Really useful for we trying to go next.

Client 5: Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. Well, I mean, and I had a really good first conversation, and it sounds like you all were a part of Venture Ecg in the match making or in some ways is that right?

Client 4: No. So I used to be part of the venture Es community and that's where I first came across a little bit. Yes.

Host 1: Got it. Well, let You know, on your end, how much do you know about orbit at this point, what would be a good place for me to start filling you in as a background or what's a good place for us to I guess, further dive into orbit.

Client 5: I mean, a guess key... I you mentioned for Pre es is a key use cases would be the the probably the best piece to jump in just could kind of a few stories and and then how we measure so I can... One could try to get my head headlines how this drives our own metrics in particular how we can actually measure some of these engagement pieces that we have. So So... Yeah. So that is me understanding best use cases similar ours And then how best will we use the platform and fundamentally from my my point of site. Pessimism. No no is normal way. But, I'm mainly kind of... The thing my flash out on my side at a lot of profit is budget. Like basically i'll go in vicki. We have a budget none of... That we we have to be revenue in every year. I mean, you have no... We have not budgeted for much technology. And so I'll spend more time thinking about how we can work together. Actual efficient manner, but also forwarding the agenda that we both seek to to forward then, I'd love to spend more time and think about being created around that element.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. So I what I can do is I can share a good use case from inside partners and one walk you through a bit of a demo what it's like from the user experience just kind to recap some things that me and I went over and our first chat And then, yeah, check on those things that you're concerned about you have questions about budget included. Sound good to deal?

Client 5: Sounds great.

Host 1: In just to recap in our first conversation, know we were talking about increasing diversity within your funds as the main focus with their eighty or so paying members you wanted to increase peer learning, exchange knowledge, lessons, automate scheduling, a bit of a static engagement right now, although, that's something that could kind of increase anything in addition to those main points No.

Client 4: That definitely sums it up community community side. I think if we really focused in the pitt learning there's like that initial jump off point, it'd be a really brilliant low use case if you like for to show like that value and back to just as that was saying like, our sponsors as well about the kind of the difference that we can make with this tool.

Host 1: Okay. So in in I minute going through the use case within partners exactly was like from perspective just to recap that in terms of use case. Is that the best use of our time?

Client 4: I guess, I mean, It's really more about, like, how maybe we could struck like that pilot that we talked about. I would say just having, like, spoken to Lad in our after our call click, we have no like, sales game with the review who've just been really clear. Like, it's a really exciting tool. It's definitely something we believe will be value for all that's really maybe the best use of time is really around, like how we can make this work. Okay.

Host 1: So in terms of in terms of budget then, does it make sense to jump to, like, what that could start off with in terms of features, if the value is obviously clear at this point, what is it like from that standpoint? I know initially shared that we have three pricing tiers Right? In a range right now. They're all one year annual agreements. They range from six to eighteen k. And you get increasing out of matching rules, engagements, things we can do through data, all that stuff. Maybe as a starting point or launching out point for the budget chat, how would does that sit with you all I basic found sounds so penny pinching, but I...

Client 5: It's like, this even the six k's is are too much. For us I can just to give you example, we we would like completely on... I basically free software because All of all of our money is comes in sponsorship. That's what goes directly on salaries. Mh. And there's no much less elsewhere. And then when we are looking to somehow having conversations now with folks like Because we we have a Crm or anything like that. It's like. Well, you know, typically, you charge this But typically, also get that. Like I say it's six k That what does six k look like for services kind? If we can be a key... If you could this up being a key sponsored promote event or something you get access to the Pc vc world. So in relationship with technical providers side looking service to the client, as an extension of, like, the smallest piece. I would obviously always pay for a license or something, you know, to make sure we have paid for first valuable service. But we'd want to try maximize utility of that service whilst minimizing them out spend, but also increasing value to you because we are network called vcs. Globally. So So I just ran that way of saying, the smallest piece were pay for and then try to extract maximum value about was sports is a fanny back so never.

Host 1: So maybe going to the essential and wanna tie it back to some goals you have. So if you're looking to increase like, the engagement the learning Yeah. In and tying it into that first tier the immediate value that we can give and then how can we break that up. So you're gonna get the value without paying, let's say an upfront lump sum annual contract. So I am saying terms, like, a number that we'd want to, like, hit oh I like In terms of a number that we're hitting, like you said your starts at six k in mine starts of one k.

Client 5: Like, that's basically the number that I have because I see little in the office.

Client 5: So it's like that, that's how far about we owe right now. Yeah.

Client 3: Right what about any... I mean, you mentioned that other tools are basically sponsored by third parties. Is... Is that an option?

Client 5: Not let's sponsored by third party. So someone like and affinity to with the conversations right now would be Again, it's like we we can only pay a thousand but they'll give us seats for that where that would all normally one seat.

Client 5: Right. But that of ten mean that we... come together to the community and say what, the affinity targets is particular So so that's gonna of affect, how can we get more seats, but without paying more is essentially or add more features. This is a difficult conversation because we really have six k that I've put towards k's. It's like a completely Yeah.

Client 3: I mean Yeah.

Client 3: This is a difficult conversation for us as well is I'm sure being an investor. You appreciate the tough environment that we're in our stage start up, ten people already incredibly stretched to provide pretty good service to all our clients and we do take friday an hour. In in the customer service. So, yeah. I mean, one k will definitely be announced sorry for us and unless your... Unless it's a community of of buyers and our buyers are community managers, directors of networks, so probably I'm not sure if there's an overlap in me Yeah. In in in your members that will make it slightly potentially more of a partnership conversation. The other thing that we're being offering to clients better are challenged with a budget is a more more favorable payment terms. So typically its annual terms. We could definitely look to change that if you if if you think there might be budget coming from somewhere, down the line if it's if it's one k now, but really Mean, we could go down. I i I think you mentioned he wake the onboarding fee and we could go down as low as five five thousand dollars, which would be what's... Where is the pound now? Four thousand plus, four and a half.

Client 3: But this is really as low as we would go. Without j the service and And without... I mean, yeah. Well, without j this is a business as well.

Client 5: Yeah. No I I'm not totally guessed it. I think the payment tells helps. In so far as Like I say, for five k, is is like It's so much for us. Okay. And I it means hate before this, but it's like it's just so much so so much that we need to to... Because most of our other capital put on events even just traveling to get our spots. So that means like you know, we set say for year and only do things virtually actually. Yeah. So that's a kind of thing. And so then how much and I'm sorry. But Yeah show my thank you but like how much...

Client 3: From. Yeah.

Client 5: how much value we gained through a technology platform? Might getting engaged in the community. That know we would go fully virtual. And doing everything on on the online through a orbit bit. And that's kind of the the cell here. It's like, no. You know what? Like we could do no travel, no imp events. Everything through Orbit and would still get that much engagement better traction, better attract. Tracking of our metrics Kpi, etcetera. If I could be convinced that that like, essentially, the cell the value that we're gonna get then you know, we can look to make cut where. But The last thing I'd want to do was take that risk have our members be like a a little platform not have their engagement. And then Basically, do everything over actually and and and and not fair the either virtual lloyd person.

Client 3: Have you by any chance? I know you mentioned you've taking a look at this slide have you seen our a case study with Vc platform, which is a community of nine hundred Vc professionals the global community.

Client 5: I haven't, but can they be ported onto to our community? Like are these communities into Is or they Oh, I just wanted to mention it as an example of someone we just have their renewal and they were literally saying how orbit has been literally complete game changer and how at this moment in time the renewal is like, not even a question because it would be harmful to the member as it would be normal to the community because I can definitely see the budget side of think is one thing, but it's also can be how much how much value orbit can add and that is that's that's...

Client 3: We we hear that quite often. And if you do other initiatives like I don't know. Odd happy hour. And I mean, i I don't know what else you spend on, but we That have conversation.

Client 5: Doesn't comm story as. Best conversation I want to have want to have a conversation which in a year's time but like, oh five k. Like don't bother it. Like, this is this is how we do things.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 5: I just would need to be feel more comfortable. We can get it's not like every community is different.

Client 3: But, like, Yeah.

Client 5: That's awesome for case studies, and that's a good one. Of like wait...

Client 3: Yeah. I'll I'll send it over to you. And I mean, I'll be super transparent. You know we we... So Vc and Vc clients whether it's connecting their portfolios or Lps or advisors in whatever shape or form is really our strongest use case. Wanna move away from it and we're working with associations and community that b software companies, but nothing grows and nothing is successful with Vc clients. It's literally so sticky. It's almost annoying. Because every thirty minutes that we been really quiet, with it's time not spent on unlocking that big market with the maybe enterprise clients But it works... I mean, this this is a bread and butter use case. We've just had renewal with We were leaders in and nevada we work with Sequoia Capital ne and Q first round on four point nine notion capital and in the Uk encore craft ventures. I mean, I I keep forgetting that. I I I feel open you So What's the transfer I mean, obviously, that's that's the.

Client 5: I mean, they heard of login in signs, etcetera. But what is What can we take from that? Is it the fact that they're don't like to be transferred over to this community? It's like a very simple I I my next call.

Client 3: Yeah. So the login, So first of we started my and I started this company. We work community managers are ourselves, and we definitely see platform fatigue. So I know haven't seen the demo, but went into a discussion, but your members will not have to deal with logins ins and none of that. We meet them in their inbox So it's super super seamless experience for Us admins I mean, average average management time of the platform in the runs it's forty five minutes for some people, it's like as low as like, ten minutes if you wanna run it more on in autopilot super low maintenance for you and frictionless for your community. Win by people in their inbox. We send them the matches in their inbox. We send them calendar invites We send a video link. We send them a feedback form in their inbox. So engagement is actually super super high exactly because you said, I mean, yeah. I doesn't... You you cannot find the life with me get me on a new platform now or a new Slack space. So that's that's universal. And on on the back end with the orbit platform, which is for Us admins. You said matching criteria, you see all the data you we work with you on the Kpis on the N match rating, you see amazing testimonials that you can then promote to grow the community or retain members and whatever other goals you have. So it's... Yeah. It's super super high impact. It's very engaging because it's curated for the members and it's very seamless. And you will see like, the engagement i I mean, maybe there's always room to be surprised. Maybe there's a cultural element now, but we do have quite a few other clients in Europe and Uk, and it it still works already really well. We we're feeling very confident in in the use case here. So and I think we also... Typically for the five k plan, we don't even offer an opt out close, but I think discussed that with with meeting as well, so you guys can try it. And I told you, i'm I mean I I'm personally invested to have more people in the Uk to work with. So Let's... Would... If you're up for a page trial for five k... Well, on the five k tier, We can definitely kick off in January. Worst case, your exposure is what, like, four hundred pounds, and then you can decide we have that conversation with the data.

Client 5: Yeah. Sounds good. What more So, I mean, I obviously, we want get to make that's successful and However me be successful with, like, getting with everything set up with engagement. What more do you believe can be done together like as a, know over overlapping up.

Client 3: Respect yeah. I mean, honestly, I'm I'm still much like an in person person in this remote world. So I'm excited to maybe grab a call in January, get the get the matching around, see how it's performing, review the I wanna hear you a story. What brought in New York, What brought you back. And see what we identify i. I I noticed we didn't touch on your other major head that you're wearing an accenture i understand here still there and you're doing this as well. Right?

Client 5: Yeah. I'm going potentially. But But yeah. I'm still extension.

Client 3: Okay. Yeah. Well, we're also we're we're we've being in talks with Deloitte ventures for two years and we're supposedly kicking off of pilot with them in twenty twenty three don't quote me. So I I... I'm I'm very curious. I wanna understand better that world. Like, the venture innovations within the corporate world. I think there's things that we could be discussing, but I don't know. We... We're doers me... And and we're very confident in the value. And if you're up for doing this one one trial, I think we'll have a lot more to discuss on both ends see like, we'll see the audience. We'll see what other touch points come out of this.

Client 5: Yeah. And... Is there a room for up selling You, obviously, I'm just to give you... Say you got on send. I'm invite this as well. So sort of we've gone from a stage. Where we had it People paying for assessment. To to half day assessment, which mainly money goes well value provides the assessment, but they were very much paying to asked for assessment they get suitable for that. And we'll be trying to get people to pay a little bit more what we add some more value to that community. So having more events, more learning having example of know best practices, etcetera. So more value we bring the more, we can actually increase the software spot and then actually generate revenue from our community.

Client 5: Yeah. This is one where. We're definitely adding value to the community, but we're aim for it, So it's could've if that that's outside. I'm thinking about what are there any upsell opportunities within the platform for yourselves or ourselves, that we should keep in mind That could be shared about the opportunities or just revenue opportunities for more of us Yeah.

Client 3: Interesting. Yeah. We're definitely thinking in terms of Yeah. Channel partners. So I I also need myself to a little bit better, who's in the community, But We also have group matching format. So some people use the one to one pairing to give people a taste of the power of these curated introductions and then say, oh, you know, I I I need to get a little bit more familiar with your fee structure, but if you have different membership tiers, you could you could offer then curated small groups cohorts and have that is an upsetting opportunity for you. We also do recommended people that you could meet at an event. So if you keep your in person events and how big they are, a lot of our clients now started first with online and they're bringing back annual annual events, and they work with us to to have three people, for example, you should meet an event as you attend a certain conference And I mean yeah, we're continuously adding features and and brainstorming and working closely with clients. So I think... Yeah. I I think just us learning more about your community and you seeing the product in action and seeing the testimonials and the n ups I mean, our average n s is eighty six, but it's actually ninety ninety ninety something... I mean, it's ridiculous, but I will pilot sequoia had an N of a hundred. So especially So.

Client 5: So sequoia is. What would your that?

Client 3: So Sequoia introduce... Sequoia uses us to match their founders. They're their operators to one another. So for example, their founder audience, their heads of Talent, they the the the operators is within their portfolio by functions and do functional matching rounds. They also have an audience of scouts So Yeah. People ebola help them with with In their network match them to one another to add value and we have other funds out in the Uk. Gosh i can't, but got our main Uk client. They are starting to match their L lps. Yeah. I mean, literally, whatever... However you think community and audiences you you want to touch, it you you can do it with orbit.

Client 5: So so the the thing that I... The the huge amount of value that I I can see and I'm... I I go from till here. Is So has their own community that they use with Lps is that completely walled god from be built off community. So then i want to invite people that Lp he commit to our community they can do that quite easy see say is that correct.

Client 3: Now. So the the tool basically connects you everything is everything is guard and it it connect the audience that you gives us. That did you give us in each individual community. So i we have very strict kind of data in privacy in place talk to certified. But actually, is something... It's something that we really wants to do help communities cross poll, and it's something that we're starting to think more and more about. So if we... Yeah. Again, once you done a little bit better the part of orbit and we can brainstorm, which maybe there's other clients but it makes sense. It's a very natural fit. We can introduce you that we can varies easy to do like a cross combination matching around.

Client 5: Okay.

Client 3: Both your consent. Yeah. In the long run, we do wanna be the matched up com communities where check ladies for a month matches with Yeah. Say diverse Db or or a certain job board, and then Yes. Sequoia, the Sequoia Us community and gets matched with perspective, I don't know talent and a geography they wanna hire maybe Nigerian tech... I I I I don't know. But, yeah, You get you get the gist of it in the long run.

Client 5: I me, definitely thoughts on I was just thinking as she said, actually, that I think if it is helpful, from the...

Client 4: Like, yeah, bi, from from your points of years or. We have a community currently a eighty, just around eighty. Actively engaged. Funds that's set, and we will be on onboarding a further fifty in one already. So it's quite and that's engaged coming community actively activity engaged. I guess like touching on what you were saying that around what would be be able to offer them and the value add that we talk to them about, not just as users and the Of orbit, but if the they then wanted go away and use all bit in their funds. So we'd would be happy to... I don't know. Like, maybe we offer a discount code that you have, like, agreed and we kind of, like, push that out of people and say, you know, you should also become users and customers of orbit.

Client 4: Can actually identify. You know, considering what we've just been talking about around budget costs.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, we can also add in the feedback form of question. Are even learning more about Orbit and then for be fully transparent. If anyone says yes, and we have a conversation enhanced and it goes anywhere, we we we can come up with a structure if it's an essential, you get a one kick back or if if it's a our ten k cost?

Client 4: No. No. Even honestly, not I'm gonna speak out ten. Like, it's so about back would i yes it is. More to do with you know, if we we were looking at like, a structured payment plan, which does quite hit that minimum that you were talking about and and we actually go in with this four hundred pound pilot. I would I would want you to see it, I guess, there is there is this added value underneath it. Guess from a little point of view can't.

Client 4: You know, hopefully, it's it's kind of adding a customer pipeline. Not that it sounds like you need health in that department. You seem to have the Vc kind of bowls I mean, with be.

Client 3: I mean, honestly, I'd also be us to see how it goes. We have not had great experience with leads from investment partners unless it's a unless it's specifically the community or head of network or operating partner at these these, investment partners, I guess, it's just not enough of a portfolio and not enough of a focus for them. So it depends on the... It depends on the job titles and the exact positions of the of the of the people in your portfolio. That's that's why I think definitely a little bit of a unknown on... on both ends themes, we're confident that your community that's gonna ton value your community, but if you think you can secure a budget at least for the paid trial in January, I think we can we can we can see if we get any immediate needs an interest and then we recon being from there and remind be able to for you something more attractive.

Client 4: Yeah. And for without page trial alternatively, you know, we we pause this for now.

Client 3: We need for coffee. You guys had the additional fifty and and we... And yeah. And and we pick it up again in One. If that's if that's like a more comfortable timeline.

Client 5: Yeah. It's not it's so much about comfort timeline, it's it's really that I think there's they're many different. Ways that we could go about this. And I think we're thinking too small Right.

Client 5: So I I think yeah. There's pay like, five grand of for years it's pilot. I think that doesn't doesn't we encapsulate the it's hardship about joint ambitions.

Client 3: Right.

Client 5: And it's also too... But it's two ways held if we why not. Because there's one way to say i, well, who's not... Within the community we have eighty five funds, plus fifty Plus those people within the funds they're pretty much everyone up and down not everyone, but like, lots of people up and down from the Gps to the you honest today, Hr. So it's it could be a thriving community, which we want to get a better hold of Yeah.

Client 5: And doing so digitally, it's a really good way to do that. But that then means that could we to be the all Vc globally to your platform. Potentially but maybe start with a pilot and going from there is the best is about next course of action. So but but I want us to be able to think but actually, in terms of a channel partnership if if we call that. You know or as a meeting saying, like, discount codes and so. So we can actually be a source of growth for yourselves as well Yeah.

Client 3: No. I mean, I I I love that definitely open to the possibility and the potential here.

Client 5: Cool? So I mean, it's really down to you. And when you want to pull trigger have house that now. But I'll leave up to you in terms of I mean, I can Frankly speaking, I would like to be able offer this to the community within the month of January.

Client 4: So Yep.

Client 4: So yes there are some details around what you were just talking about from Like, what is that that page try like. What is the exact cost of that? So know just... you know, said we could start from four hundred, but, like, what would it actually entail Does it limit users? Would we... Yeah. What what does that mean? So that we can at least get it out there. And start to see as you said some of the data coming back and hopefully some of the the stronger and guests coming back on that as well.

Client 3: Yeah. Okay. Amazing. I will work on the follow of what that could look like. And hopefully we can we can review the the feedback in person. Where you both based?

Client 4: We're in London.

Client 3: I know It's all spread out. I'm gonna mean, I'm in richmond.

Client 4: So... I east london. Because it guides to out.

Client 3: Because it. Okay. Okay. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.

Client 5: Based Just south.

Client 3: Yeah. Because of the nurseries, I don't... I mean, I have a two and a half year old that dictates my life And a in a nine month old, but he's he's he's still Yeah three three months older there.

Client 5: So still in the in the getting to gain used this case When we're sorry, you have a three month old yeah.

Client 3: Oh my god. Congrats. You're like proper You dad territory.

Client 5: Exactly. That's what sal yeah. I'm still again used to and you.

Client 3: Oh my it's gonna be such sweet Christmas though. I hope you've like lined up the Get something on Amazon prime right away.

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 5: Be I'll be doing I no. That's why i'm not pushing family for all the dressed up and and made of getting less than enthused.

Client 5: But... Yeah. Let's did you down... Immediately I'll let you take it. Me. I think I mean, I'm good convinced terms what this can go, but I just... you know, i wanna I wouldn't be able to stop in the evaluate Thirty for the trial. And then also in that period, think more broadly about what this could look like. So Cool.

Client 3: I will have more data on on on both ends. So Oh it's it's taking these decisions with data and hand.
