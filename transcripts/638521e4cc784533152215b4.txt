Client 1: How's it going.

Client 2: Oh, Ben Shrieker on Too. And Merry and Benjamin.

Client 1: Oh, what's up.

Client 3: Hi.

Client 1: I'll be on 1 second.

Client 1: Okay. Getting back to my computer. So I guess we can start with. A round Robin of. Does everybody like pumpkin pie? Or do we like Peacon pie? And who had more of which. Or maybe there's a different kind of pie. I don't know. Maybe people like Apple pie. I'm not sure who wants to start.

Client 2: For Sharika up Ben.

Client 4: Peacon Pie definitely had more of it. And favorite, more.

Client 1: Love it. Now. Are we going whipped cream or no whipped cream?

Client 4: We don't know what creams on Pecan pie, because, you know, I'm just. I'm a traditional guy.

Client 1: What about what? About ice cream, though.

Client 4: Ice cream depends on the type, but. More than likely I like to have I like to keep my pie separate.

Client 1: All right, all right, it's good to answer. Fair answer. Sharika Peacon Pi, pumpkin pie, whipped cream ice cream.

Client 5: Well, Apple pie. That's my. Secret hidden talent is my Apple pie.

Client 1: Are we doing a lattice top, or are we doing just a regular top? You making cool designs in there. What are we doing.

Client 5: All of the above. It all depends on how lazy I'm feeling that day.

Client 5: I'm by the end of making my crust.

Client 1: I see, I see. I'm a Costco guy.

Client 5: I should go pick one up and tell him I made it myself.

Client 1: All right, who else we got? Lee, I know you're on the call.

Client 2: Exact Strika. Except I don't make it. I just eat it. I love I would lie.

Client 1: And yes, denial ice cream. Yep. Nice. But are we. Are we talking about Apple pie where it's real apples and just a little bit of sugar. Are we talking about where it's got, like, that syrupy. Thick sauce.

Client 2: Real Apple pie apples.

Client 1: Nice. All right. I like what I'm hearing. Who else is on the call? Pumpkin pie, peacom pie. Or, I guess, Apple pie.

Client 3: Or sweet Potato Pie. That's me.

Client 1: Oh, sweet potato pie. Okay, that's similar. Okay. Are we going with whipped cream? We're going with ice cream.

Client 3: We go with marshmallows.

Client 1: Oh, like toast and marshmallows on top.

Client 3: Exactly.

Client 1: Nice. Do you put pecans on your pumpkin pie. Or your sweet potato pie?

Client 3: I'm a nut free house.

Client 1: Okay. What about Brown sugar? We doing Brown sugar.

Client 3: We could do some Brown sugar.

Client 1: Nice. All right. I think there's one more person on the call. Who else is on the call.

Client 6: Yeah. I think I'm whipped cream with pumpkin pie.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: There we go, we got one winner. Yeah, he's got one right answer. All right. Sweet. Well, I'm getting to my computer now. So I looked at the agenda. It looked fine to me. The only thing I added was that CMO thing. But that's not until March. I just need to have panelists lined up for that, which I'll work on. But if you guys have any recommendations of people that you think we should invite to come on, that panel happy to do it. They don't allow journalists. Typically not to do the panel, or like to lead a panel, or to like, moderate a panel. But if you guys think there is one, then happy to pitch that as well. But Yeah.

Client 3: That's a CMO panel. Which the panel is up.

Client 1: The CMO summit.

Client 3: It's in. We spoke about that this morning. Who would be like an ideal candidate for that.

Client 1: I don't know whoever we want.

Client 1: I got the panel. We can do whatever we want with it. It's if you guys got clients that you think would be a good fit or that our marketing leader up and coming person, if you got I mean whoever you want.

Client 3: I mean, we obviously have a lot of CMO marketing clients, but it's more about, like, what would serve you.

Client 6: Yeah.

Client 1: I don't know. I can have a conversation about whatever you want.

Client 3: That's the thing. This is a pedal that we purchased.

Client 1: No, we didn't purchase anything.

Client 1: I went out and pitched them myself. And then they told me, I can have a panel so on whatever you want.

Client 3: Whatever I want. They gave you a panel whenever you want, for free.

Client 1: Yep, sure did.

Client 3: So okay. So what do you want the focus to be.

Client 1: I have no idea. I mean, I can choose whatever I want. I was thinking about doing more with less since everybody keeps talking about it, although I think it's kind of drowned out now, but. I honestly have no idea. I mean, I'm sure I could come up with a hundred different panels. But I'd rather talk to the other panelists and then figure out what we want to talk about before we lock ourselves into a topic.

Client 3: Do you have any other information about sessions.

Client 6: And time.

Client 3: And all that.

Client 3: Yeah, here.

Client 1: I'm gonna send a link in the chat.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 1: So. Who they have speaking. Is the Director of Brandon Marketing at Live, the Director of Marketing at Grubhub, the Senior Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer, Devanti, the Head of Integrated Marketing and Instagram. The CMO impact. Ahead of Marketing at Tik Tok. A VP of Growth marketing at Nickelodeon. Those are the only ones I know.

Client 3: Okay and is Don doing this panel.

Client 1: No, because it's marketing. I'm doing the panel.

Client 3: Oh, you're doing the title.

Client 1: Okay. Even though I'm not a CMO.

Client 3: You're moderating it.

Client 1: No, I'm participating. That's how I got the panel. They did a couple things. I recorded a podcast with them. Then I did a. Talk track with them for their other events. And now they want me to come speak.

Client 6: So what was your podcast? What was the podcast about.

Client 1: They had just asked about my growth journey and my experience working at Startups and how I went from corporate startup land and that transition there. And then what the experience working at Bolt was like and how we scaled the organization and what skills we transition from there over here. And then I gave him five lessons of things that I learned, which is like sometimes you got. To rip and replace stuff like Bandaid solutions don't work. The role of integrated marketing in a world of channel experts, which was like, basically you have a lot of people that are functional experts. And so you have to have somebody in integrated marketing who acts as the quarterback to make sure all of their specialists all play their best roles. So think about, like a quarterback with all of the different teammates. Then another one was. Necessary or getting sales and marketing alignment which was setting up proper OKRs and doing proper lead tracking and enabling sales and making sure that they have the right collateral and talk track. I can send you the whole presentation. I also gave it to another, like VC portfolio company, too. So so that's what I had, like initially talked to them on the podcast about. And then they asked me if I wanted to come or potentially come do this. And so I chatted with the person that runs it. And they said I got the slot. So Yeah.

Client 6: Okay. Because I want to think, you know. Try. I think what we're trying to think about is, how do we make this. A. Almost like a, you know, to entice people to, you know, we want to we want to teach them about arc.

Client 6: We want them. You know, we want to have some kind of BD connected to it.

Client 6: Right?

Client 1: Correct.

Client 6: The topic, whatever it is, might be depend upon who we ask.

Client 6: Well, how about.

Client 6: You bring in some of maybe. You know. I guess not really venture capital people. But like people like who work with entrepreneurs or, you know, right. Because you want to develop relationships there. So because you want.

Client 6: What. I'm trying to figure out how do we make arc, like the kind of.

Client 1: Sec. Secret. What if we brought in other people from Fintech and I talk about how to market money. So maybe we get somebody from chime. And then the person that Chime's talking about, how do they market money at Chime? And then we get Arc, which is like, how do we market money or sell money to other businesses? And then maybe we get somebody else who's, like in a similar space. But it's all about how do you market money, right. Because everybody at the end of the day is selling the same thing and everybody's marketing the same thing. But everybody's got different tactics that they're using to get there.

Client 6: Yeah. And looking so in looking at the people that are actually speaking, though, that none of them are going to be. You know clients of Arc, right?

Client 6: No, they're all big. Must have to get you. Almost have we have to go. Whoever we.

Client 3: Speak with you. Yeah. This is how I see it. I see there are some big names. So if we can use it as a way to attract a draw to your panel. And instead. Not focus on your selling point as a company. But maybe instead as a CMO once you actually get funding, how do you allocate. As a something like that because then it allows gives a CMO who might be higher profile a stage that they wouldn't otherwise have.

Client 1: Yeah, I like that. But then maybe what we do is I mean, I could moderate it, and then I could ask the other CMOS how they're deploying their capital so you could flip it. Either way, I could be on the panel, and they could ask me questions, especially in this environment.

Client 3: In this environment, how are you allocating.

Client 6: Marketing how do you market when your three founders suddenly quit.

Client 1: Yeah. How do you Mark.

Client 3: Or you know, everyone is trying to keep the money longer that they got right and extend their runway. So how do you extend it from a marketing standpoint. I think those are like more. On point, but then. Who do we want to ask.

Client 1: Yeah, I don't know. So that's just a thought. Yeah, I don't know. But it's more to, like, get your, like, cogs, like, rolling to figure out what do we want to talk about? But we have the panel. We have the slot. We can have up to four people. So three more people. And then what do you want to talk about? It not sure.

Client 3: Sending the runway of your marketing dollars in this environment because it's related to what you do. As far as funding. You know smaller companies. And it makes you. Responsible lender. You know what I mean? It's creating an education platform. For a CMO, I just think. It fits what you're trying to do.

Client 1: Yeah, I'm on board.

Client 3: So who. Makes sense to do that.

Client 1: Yeah, I don't know. We can talk about it. Offline. I just wanted to flag it, so it's on you guys, radar.

Client 1: Lend a hand whenever we get to it.

Client 3: It is too bad that you can have a journalist.

Client 3: I know, because I was thinking it has to be in person.

Client 1: It's in New York.

Client 1: When is it? March 15.

Client 3: Yeah, because Danielle's sister is the editor of Ad age.

Client 3: And she could have been a good person to help lead that kind of discussion.

Client 1: Well, we can do whatever we want again. It's our panel. So we tell enough, this is who we're having, that they're gonna let it happen. They just said typically, don't prefer to have journalists lead it.

Client 3: But but it's also good for us for you to. Build a relationship. With marketing person.

Client 1: Yep. So however you want to do it, I don't know. We can figure that out later, but we got to give him an answer. I think in the next two weeks I think they want an answer by December, something like December 15 or 17th. I forget what it is or whatever that Friday is. The Let me look at my calendar. 16.

Client 3: Merry Luisa Beltran.

Client 3: Yeah. Is she the right person.

Client 6: I don't think so. I mean, I can ask her. I mean, she's so focused every time I talked around companies that are going public.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, listen, someone like Janine is the right person.

Client 3: That's it. But that's. The other one would be really good. Is Richard Collins from Axios unless he's only retail.

Client 6: He does only retail.

Client 6: But if there if they're trying to get away from journalists. I'm just wondering if there's anybody that's, like, kind of. That we know in the marketing industry that would just be a good person.

Client 1: Yeah. I mean, I got a network, too.

Client 1: I just wanted to engage you guys, so you don't get blindsided by.

Client 6: Like, what is this? Yeah.

Client 3: Cool.

Client 1: So we let's think about that offline get back to each other some ideas. So then I see we have Arcadvans plus release here. Maybe before we jump into that. Maybe we talked about what happened with pipe.

Client 1: Did you guys get the download from Don or Not Valley?

Client 3: Okay, so I just dropped you have the inside scoop.

Client 1: Well, I don't have the full inside scoop, and I have what everybody is suspecting. So there's an article there that breaks down, like what they think happened, but essentially. As everybody knows, pipelines to all kinds of different businesses. They don't just lend a SAS, they lend to Fintech, they lend to banks, they lend to Crypto. They lend to all kinds of different people, right? 50% of their revenue is SAS, which means it's relatively. Relatively flat, relatively consistent, relatively predictable. Which is why Arc like SAS. We like SAS because it's predictable revenue. It continues to come in. There's not really much volatility. It's just very consistent. Why is that good? Because then you have very low levels of defaults, because if they have consistent revenue, then they continue to pay it back. So Pipe, on the other hand, operates this marketplace. This marketplace of buying and selling revenues. Pipe says they operate this Nasdaq of revenue where they have buyside and sell side investors. Well, the reality is that Pipe has one by side investor. So they have one group of banks. There's ten banks and all ten of those banks by every security, every collateralized security, which what they do is they take these RBF loans. They package them up, and then they sell that package to an investor, which in this case is their ten banks, so that's their buy side. So supposedly the rumor is that they bought or they were lending. Tens, 20s, however, many millions of dollars to this. Basically Bitcoin Mining Company which. Mine bitcoins mind script of currencies etc. Which is fine, but obviously now that the price of crypto has gone down. The crypto mining companies underwater. Well, there's no revenue. Then there's no way for pipes to get paid back. And because of the way the credit agreements are structured, including with Arc, they have to put up their own equity dollars alongside their credit dollars. Right. So. $0.90 on the dollar is the investors. $0.10 on the dollar is pipes. So now you have large losses. And so now, even though they say they stepped down and everybody says, oh, it's just because, you know, it's their time to move on and not experience, blah, blah. Who knows what actually happened? There's clearly defaults happening, which we confirmed from some of the people that used to work at Pipe. And so now the whole thing started to implode. Which is why when we tell you guys we can't have default, otherwise the credit pulls in and you can't get any more credit. This is exactly why, because now you have large defaults on the books and nobody's willing to now extend credit towards you. Also because Clear Banks going bankrupt and Clear Bank is the one that supports all of pipes inbound businesses, meaning Clear Bank gets business. But now they can't support it because they can't facilitate those loans. And they hand that all the pipe pipes now taking all of the risk or assumed all of the risk of Clear Bank. So there's like a whole bunch of different things that have now structured this deal, that. Now may or may not have blown up which is why everybody is suspecting different things but nobody knows the facts.

Client 3: The three founders would all resign on the same day.

Client 1: Exactly. That's the whole thing, right? Like unless something traumatic happened, there's no way that all three just say, oh, today's the day we're just all done.

Client 6: So, yeah. And I didn't buy the whole inexperience, and we want someone with fintech experience or whatever.

Client 2: I read something like that.

Client 6: Did you like the last quote, though?

Client 1: Austin? Which one was the last quote?

Client 6: Rabindranath.

Client 1: Oh, it I somebought I love oh oh with the last line where it's like that storytellers?

Client 1: Yeah, they're all good storytellers. Fast. Whatever the other one was, and then Bolt.

Client 1: Yeah. Not like that. That was pretty funny.

Client 6: Well, what? So okay, so now let's unpack this for Arc. What does that mean for you guys, if anything?

Client 1: So let's talk about that. So that's one isolated incident that I don't know if you saw, but then Time, which is a consumer bank, now did massive layoffs, and they also pause a whole bunch of other accounts just like Brexit.

Client 1: So there's like a. Whole bunch of like stuff brewing in FINTAC that has now made a lot of journalist question, what's bughazi and what's not so going back to now, why is it important to be a fiduciary of balances? And which is the next thing we're going to release Arcadance Plus is like now that we know this, this industry is getting much more scrutinized. How or how do we want to change the way we're pitching arcadvance plus. If at all.

Client 6: Well, if it addresses it, I think we did. We need to we need to figure it. What was the timing of it, by the way.

Client 1: For Piper. For what Chimes was last week.

Client 6: Two weeks ago. Our.

Client 1: Adult Next Wednesday.

Client 6: I mean, I'm thinking about this. How do you? Because it sounds like to me that. You know some of the things that you're putting in place. Are kind of like. You know. Addressing. Some of the issues that are happening and kind of protecting. Arc and its clients correct.

Client 1: Yes. But the way that that can be flipped is then saying, Well, they were fiduciary. They were not. Obligating their Fiduciary responsibilities because they lent out money that they shouldn't have, but they were providing capital startups that needed it. Whereas Arcs now basically not shut it completely off. But we've very much narrowed our credit box to people that can access capital from Art. So like, yes, we are. Extending or shrinking our credit box. But what that means, in practicality speak, is that the number and amount of advances that were out issuing is much less than it was before. So, like, yes, we're protecting our own interest. Yes, we're protecting our investors dollars. But the reality is. As it continues to shrink the box of people that are qualified gets less and less and less.

Client 6: Right. I mean. I don't know how Leap feels about this, but I. I look at it as still. A. You know if I'm an entrepreneur. And I need money. Probably most likely. I'm thinking VC first.

Client 1: Right.

Client 6: Yeah. Look, I go down that road, and it cost too much. I'm not I'm giving up too much. And then I start looking at alternatives. Right? I start going looking at my options. Right. At some point, if I don't fit into that box that you just described.

Client 6: Yep. You know what there. There aren't many are options, but that company probably didn't have many options prior to that, other than correct.

Client 6: Other than to give away half the company for less correct.

Client 6: Yep. So I mean. You're still a you're still a.

Client 1: Source.

Client 1: No, we're definitely still a source. It's just a question of. Well, we know that this one's imploding. We know some other ones are starting to implode is now the right time. And if so, great, because I think it talks well to Arc and what risk measures we put in place in a variety of other things. But it also shows our cards to the fact that now, like there is real risk.

Client 1: And as you've now seen, like investors can be a little wary of risk. So it's just something to think about, not saying we need to push it back, but just something to think about.

Client 1: Totally okay with the December 7 embargo. The press release just needs one quote. Signed off. The video is being worked on so that'll be finalized, and we're working on all the other assets so we can launch it just something to think about. And then we'll probably when do you need to start pitching that to get it under Embargo for next week? Wednesday. Like when did you go? No, go by.

Client 2: I mean. Well, can I ask you a question?

Client 2: Yeah. Or like, this is kind of important, right? I actually really love your headline. We might just want to add, like, we always put in like, you're solving like, you know, two support startups in this challenging environment.

Client 2: But it's a great release. It doesn't really explain the product at all, which the way you explained it is pretty. Like it just kind of reminds me of all these derivatives people who are like inventing these cool innovations.

Client 2: So you.

Client 1: Yeah. I mean it's sort of it. Sort of is that the challenges we don't want to explain how we do it, because otherwise it kind of beats the purpose, because then anybody else can do it right. So all we're really doing is taking advantage. And then stacking those advances on top of each other so you can take one advantage and then another advance, and then another advance, and then another advance. And because you take a new advance every month. The new advance pays off the payment for the first advance, then the second advance you pull pays off the first advance plus the principal from the initial loan. Then the third advance pays off the second one plus the first one plus the initial advance. And so we're stacking them on top of each other, like building blocks or Legos. And that's how we're able to create a product that looks and feels like. A venture debt facility, meaning it has a sixmonth interest only period where no payments are acquired. It has a lower price point, etc. It's just if we tell them we're going to stack them like Legos, then they know exactly how it's being structured. And then they can all do the exact same thing.

Client 2: But. Well, sorry, Merry.

Client 6: Go ahead. I was just gonna say, like. Wouldn't they figure that out?

Client 1: No. Because right. What they think right now is that we have a new credit facility. And that's why we've we've been quiet on the raising front. They think that we've raised the new credit facility to allow us to offer an interest only period. Gotcha.

Client 2: So just because I know we're coming up on time, and I know how.

Client 2: When we have news, right?

Client 1: We want.

Client 2: So I think that the most interesting thing about this is right. It's a tough environment. You're offering access to capital. And it's sort of like the Kyle Wiggers thing you did with Don that we did like the case for debt. Like Arc is creating the case for that with no covenants, no warrants, no restrictions. So that story is good. To be honest. And Merry correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think the media are gonna go Gaga over this like it's not like breaking news, but it's it's arc as an innovator again. We would never say stacking like Legos because it sounds Bernie made off like it. You have to be careful, right? Like it's. It is very innovative.

Client 2: I don't think you should tell the media that you're literally like giving them money and then giving them more money the next month to pay back that money. It sounds.

Client 2: Pondy ish, but I understand it isn't. So I think we need an explainer graph. That's what media will ask. And I don't I don't think like a Kia or a Marianne or like some of your Bigger Beat reporters. Will write into it per se, but we'll offer it to everyone.

Client 6: Well, let me. Just a question to you let Lee because I think you would just I want to pose a question to you and maybe to the group. But given. The news of pipe. Doesn't that raise people's awareness and at least concern and, you know, get their wheels turning. Because I mean, this is, like, all of a sudden, you know, you look over the last six months, alternative financing kind of companies, like, just the name. They've all just, like, burst onto the scene. Venture Capital went, you know, just went Gaga. I'll ever say nobody's funding anybody here's how to do it. And now, all of a sudden, one of the biggest. Companies you know. Ought. Austin told us. Probably isn't. In the mainstream press yet. Right. All they know is that the three founders uptime, but they're smoke there. Right. So there is concern, because there's no way three founders just leave on the same day for shit and giggles. So I don't know. So when you say you don't think like a Kia or a Marion. I mean, I don't know. I think maybe it's worth. Floating it to them because they might. But then that's why I was kind of answered the question asking the question at the beginning is, how do we frame this right.

Client 3: I'm thinking like I'm thinking, yeah, there's, you know. I don't think that you can leave it to them.

Client 6: To frame, correct?

Client 6: Right. They'll go off wherever they want to.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, I think that it's a really important time to position. Arc separately from a pipe and maybe feel that IR girl that I saw speak at web summit.

Client 6: She was really good awesome friend.

Client 3: What's happening to her.

Client 1: Which one is that? Oh, you're talking about.

Client 3: Yes, man.

Client 1: Yeah. She's the she's the like I forget what a meat call is like the covered Princess or something like she's the one that all the investors love and she's wind and dying them all so. She's got herself a nice moat.

Client 3: But she might be good for the taking right now.

Client 1: I'm just saying maybe she takes on CEO. You never know.

Client 3: She could she could. Yeah. No. I think that, you know, you've been so so closely aligned with them that it's a really important time to distinguish.

Client 6: Yep. I was gonna say differentiate, but distinguishes the right word.

Client 3: Yeah. Because, you know, when we saw Don, he was basically saying, like, that model's dead. He actually told me that this was gonna happen. And I just think that, you know, he really wanted to position. Arc. He said this at that time, more as a bank because didn't want to implode like he thought Pipe would.

Client 3: Yep. Exactly. We have to be really careful also, when we're pitching things that a journalist doesn't put us in the same bucket, even when Matt called me and said, you know. Arc's Competitors going down.

Client 3: Can we speak. On. So, you know, I just think that we need to have, like, more important than just an article. We need to have, like, a clear separation of how we're different.

Client 1: Yeah, we're ready. We're writing a blog post on that exact point today. So hopefully go out this week.

Client 3: That's really great. And hopefully we can get Don story up.

Client 1: Yeah. Right. That was one thing he asked about. I do have to jump in a minute for a prospecting call. Is there anything else that you guys need. I saw his thing back and forth, but done this so that's fine. Then I saw the Spin Tech Nexus interview with the briefing sheet come over. So that's good.

Client 3: I think that the only others being is that we're coming for that meeting next week. You know, he's looking for an agenda.

Client 3: And we really want to talk about, like, how to like what we're gonna do with Forbes going. I don't know what so you know, Basil gave us notice in December. As kind of like, you know, just in case, but you know, if he's going to give it again. Next week. First, it's more like, you know. Are we gonna keep going or we.

Client 3: Doing so I think. It was really to figure out, like where we are.

Client 1: Yeah Yep Yep.

Client 6: When where where will the meeting be? Because. And where do you Where'd you guys end up?

Client 1: We don't have an office, but we're getting a WeWork for that day. So it'll be at a WeWork.

Client 1: Okay. So. Sorry I gotta jump, but if there's anything else you guys want to chat through, like, my schedule is fairly wide open today.

Client 1: I just have to go to this one call.

Client 3: Really helpful as far as helping us prepare.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 3: Whatever we should be thinking about, like especially, you know. Like a go forward plan.

Client 1: Yeah, we forget about that. Maybe later today. If you guys have time. I know it's almost at the end of the day. So maybe tomorrow, but whatever day.

Client 3: So maybe we should put 30 minutes on the calendar this week just to figure out. What well, let's I mean, I think once the four of's article runs and you can see what we can do with it that might just change course. So maybe like after that runs and yeah, when we send things around and then, you know, if you could send us.

Client 3: That blog.

Client 3: That is the positioning on how you're different. That'd be good too.

Client 1: Cool. Sounds good. All right. Well. Happy post Thanksgiving Holiday and happy say we're Monday and chat soon.

Client 6: All right, thanks.
