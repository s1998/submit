Client 3: Greens, North Carolina.

Host 2: Oh, Great. Is that challenge?

Client 3: Yeah. About an hour and a half. Yes, sir.

Client 3: We're equal distance between Charlotte and Raleigh if you know, Raleigh as well.

Host 2: Yeah.

Host 2: Sure. Now been on my bucket. Hear it's Awesome. Is an amazing destination.

Client 3: It is. It's it's my hometown. So i'm a bit biased but it's a great little city.

Host 2: Yeah. Well, I am in my own hotel this week. I mean, I'm calling from Paris right there which is also It's good but the weather sucks.

Client 3: okay. Yeah. I mean, I come through from time to time my my other is is pretty high up within one of the the big businesses there. So he works in law funds if you know a lot of funds, obviously, Yeah.

Host 2: That sticker? Oh because I think the difference in the...

Client 3: He works in the black tower. You know the black tower, Ari r Yeah.

Client 3: That he's he's in nuclear power. So they have the biggest building there.

Client 3: They're they're a pretty large French company yet.

Host 2: Yeah. Yeah. Everybody's is huge. Sure.

Client 3: Well remove to. So where he lives, But... Yeah.

Host 2: It leaves little stop.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 2: Oh, man, The full guy.

Client 3: Yeah. It's is is hate life. Right?

Client 3: Yeah. It's it's nice. You know, again, it's a different lifestyle than here in America to some degree but but... Yeah. I enjoy going to visit for sure.

Host 2: Yeah. It's a it's a good day. Sure. Well, but by they were have taken connection on our side. So My name is Kevin. This is Jebediah. Designing on the team. We are... So we'll come called cell ai. And they is i again. Because and we are building a dagger for sales teams. So we're looking to... right touch on the market, and you educate ourselves about the market and the competition and what you will, but they don't do well And I believe I found name online. You were leaving a review for con on G two. So... Yeah. Again, just you able to heal about you and i what you found good and bad about damage long Perhaps can kick it, please Can can you give us a quick control of you. What what what do you do and what does your company do?

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, monopoly squared you know, we are a third party call center solution. Right? So, you know, domestically, we have about four hundred agents that are on the phones all day every day. We do use two different dial. You know, we we are actually introducing a a third as well currently as we speak. And really, that's simply for redundancy. Right? You know, if you run a a pretty large business or, you know, Bp o if we'll call it that. You never really wanna put all your eggs one basket because, you know, if that dial breaks or something happens ends. I mean, you know, god forbid that the business, you know, really, you know, isn't a tight situation. So we do use a few, but Con v is is one of our our biggest, you know, use cases. And, you know, we've been with them for guess, you know, going on about six years But yeah, that's that's ultimately what we do is we're Bp o. Right? We work with businesses to, you know, answer their inbound calls, make their outbound calls do you know, basically warm transfers. Once we get the person on the phone and we maybe verify some information. Then we we send it right over to the, you know, call find whatever it is, if it's insurance, then we send it to an insurance agent. If it's a mortgage conversation that we send it to a loan officer if it's something else, will then we send it to, you know, the credit specialist or whatever else. Whatever vertical we're in. Yep.

Host 2: So is it like support or sales or So, I mean, sales and customer service, I like to say, yeah.

Client 3: Got it.

Client 3: I really use the word support. I mean, maybe, you know, here in America when I say the word support, like, you know, a lot of people think about, like, you know, It or development support. Right? Like, you know, maybe doing, like a a quick like, hey. My computer is not working necessarily or you know, I bought this product from you.

Client 3: I need some assistance that's not really our specialty you know, by any means is is doing like tech support, that's not our specialty.

Host 2: That makes sense. Tell be more that... So what when the other three day is that still using all it to use right now.

Client 3: I mean, can those we use five nine as well? Yes. If you're familiar with five nine, and we've just sort of, you know, we're piloting one that again, we we know the business well, but it's called noble biz.

Host 2: Oh, no no. What?

Client 3: Noble beds.

Host 2: No Biz.

Client 3: Yep you know, be.

Host 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 2: Yeah.

Host 2: Alright. Supposed to make you know this one.

Client 3: Again. Right? You know, I think there the reality was follow the dragon.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 2: How did you find out about all this all of these players here?

Client 3: Again, I mean, we've been in the space for, you know, I guess about twelve years and, you know, again, you know, noble biz is sort of, you know, one of the high ups actually used to work for our business and decided to to, you know, sort of roll over and and make a change. Right, you know, for his family for himself. And and so that's sort of how that's come about. But five now we've been using for a while they're they're pretty large player when it comes to contact center space. Right? I mean, their platform is is used by a lot of folks. I mean, I'd say they're you know their customer network is probably even larger than, you know, larger than can boast necessarily.

Host 2: How all do is this players compared also of our Five nine and base.

Client 3: I mean, again, you know, there's pros and cons to all of them, but I mean, what I like about Con those is you know, they they use, you know, they do sort of the we'll call it, you know, number administration on the back end. Right? So instead of maybe in a five nine, like you know, I have sort of an employee that every day is rotating numbers to sort of, you know, stay on a spam, that sort of thing. Right? It's more of a manual process, whereas zinc can, you know, they're sort of doing that for us. And ensuring that numbers are staying valid and and, you know, it helps contact rates. Right? You know, and that's in this world, contact rates are critical.

Host 2: Then me know what does whether this do here to rotate the, Yeah.

Client 3: I mean, since I don't work for Con directly, right, you know, I can't say with one hundred percent certainty, but, you know, my understanding is that again, they have something built within their system on the back end that it knows, hey, I've made a hundred dials on this Did Right? So hey. I need to rotate it. And and I use the number one hundred, I'm not saying that exactly what it is. I see Jebediah shaking in his head. Yes. But, you know, I use the number hundred, but, you know, and then, hey, let me use a different one. And it's a local presence. Right? So ultimate you know, hey, if your area code two zero one, I'm gonna dial you from a two zero one number your area codes seven zero four or gonna call you from the seven zero four number if it's this, I'm call you from this. Right? And so they just have a bunch of those on the back end, they're constantly rotating I don't know, like, from, you know, a a total build I can't really explain how They do that, but, you know, that sort of you know, how it work.

Host 1: Does that mean that the individual caller does not get to choose the phone number to use. It's just kind of randomly automatically signed for them. Based on who they're calling, Exactly.

Client 3: So like, you know, if I have a list of ten people right in their all different area codes. You know, I'm gonna call each of them from their distinct area account. And. And then, you know, but the next time they get a call, it might not be from that same number from that same area. You see saying. So then so if I called you five times, you may get called for me from five different number.

Host 1: Okay. Does that get known that if Jebediah has a missed call on his phone, and he now just seize it and close it back, it knows to flow it appropriately right?

Client 3: not to be cliche with with Flows name, but it it knows to to flow it in properly and and where to route it to Okay.

Host 2: What the make... Sorry. Did you have any further questions about this Jebediah?

Host 1: No With all your favorite things well I guess, so your favorite and least we things about Con five nine and normal.

Host 2: So I guess, that's kind of questions. Yeah. I mean you know, top things are, you know, their supervisor, you know, being a supervisor managing the people.

Client 3: Right? They're screens, you know, it's very clean. You know, it's easy to recognize like, who's on a call? Like, who's there a bathroom break? Who's, you know, Dewey x y and z. Right?

Client 3: You know, right interrupt.

Host 1: Is is this con? So that you're talking about...

Client 3: So can... Oh so... Yeah. Correct. So, yeah, we're we're now we'll we're just focus solely we our ke.

Host 1: So Their supervisor, you know, access is very good right at the top, it sort of, you know, has hey, you know, how many calls have you made today?

Client 3: You know, how many leads are in the hopper, like, you know, what's the abandoned rate? What's you know, the you know, average wait time for an agent in between calls like, what's the average, you know, disposition time? Like, all these sort of will call high level stats, and then it has, like, hey how many agents are logged in? How many are waiting? How many are in a call? Many are polyps. Right? And then you have the the breakdown sort of by person. So hey, you know, this agent Denise is on. Right? And has been talking for two minutes. Hey this agent agent Petrovina is, you know, none call and has been waiting for a minute in three seconds for his next call. Right? So it shows you all of this in a very easy way. And then from there, I can whisper in. That's important. Right? Like, maybe I need to be like, hey, Jebediah. Go to lunch. Right? Like, so I can whisper in, you know, and and sort of say, hey, Jebediah. This Thompson here, you know, from the management team, please, you know, go ahead and and log yourself out. I need you to go to lunch. Right? And and I could do that or I can barge into a call. Maybe Jebediah is like, raising his hand and saying like, hey, Oh my god. Like I have an irate customer on the line. I wanna... you know, somebody needs to take it, you know, care of this guy or or down Well then I can board right in. Right? And I could say... Hey Jebediah? My name is Thompson. I'm a manager here with X y Company.

Client 3: You know, I'll be glad to assist you. So that, I'd say supervisor, that's very important right? Because that's how we make critical decisions for how many agents do we need in? How many agents should we like, be sending home, you know, how many calls are remaining all those things. Right? Like, that's very important. Don't talk about their they're reporting. So then not looking at live, that that I would call real time now for digesting like, how do we perform yesterday? How do we perform last week, how do we perform last month? Their reporting is very good. You know, it's very clean cut very easy and concise to read right, they or when it comes to reporting, their accessibility is key. Right? Whereas you know, now comparing it to a five nine. Five nine is a very big company that's global that, you know, again has clients within a lot of different you know, countries, what we'll call it where I'd say, boast those client bases majority Us based. You know, five nine, if I need something to be changed, like, hey, guys, I want you to add this, you know, this field. Right? Like speed delete. We'll use that as an example. Right? Like, and I want you to show me what my speed delete is. Five nine, I have to send in an enhancement, you know, whatever, you know, ticket and god forbid that's not to say that it'll be fulfilled. That's just like hey, we see it. Thank you flow for submitting. And, like, if we feel like we should then we might entertain it and we might reach out to you. But I can tell you, over the past four years, I've submitted probably eight of those and I've never gotten a callback. Right? So You know, and and I still have to do all of that manually by manipulate manipulated, you know, manipulate probably isn't the right word, but manually computing what that those values or or needs are where is Can also? Can go right to the owner, but I also, you know, have that relationship, and I can say, hey, guys, This is critical to my business within twenty four hours, they'll make the change. Right? You know, they get their dev team right into it. But they know that when I bring it, it's not gonna be something silly and stupid. It's gonna be something that look globally every one of my clients probably wants what Thompson wants. And and so wanna deploy this thing as soon as possible. And so that's very good. You know, and the reporting again. It's it's very easy. Right? You can export it you can automate it. A big thing is Reporting to automate is important, especially if you work with a Bp like ourselves you know I have a lot of different clients that are I'm dealing with a lot of different campaigns. And so I wanna send Jebediah his specific information i wanna send flow his specific information. I a send Thompson his specific information so I wanna be able to automate those in like, roll data logs to those clients. So being able to email every day it's seven Am or every day at eleven Pm or, you know, every week, you know, or every month, you know, there's different cadences But again, those opportunities are very good as well. Yeah.

Host 1: Got it. Cool. Yeah.

Host 2: You mentioned so much. Oh, yes. So so many... So you think that that's double take on here. Tell me moment the reporting bit. Like, what kind of metrics do you like to report on?

Client 3: I think it's, you know, important that, you know, you do see, hey, you know, In our business, we do a lot of transfer. So it's sort of like what is the first leg? So if I call Jebediah? I. Hey, Jebediah, You know, how are you today? I'm trying to, you know, sort of get in the hit him to buy into what I I'm sort of selling. Right? Then we put Jebediah on hold. We attempt a second leg. Right, which is to say the client. So I'm calling Jebediah because I want sell on insurance. Home in her auto insurance. Right In America everyone has have. Oh insurance. Wanna so Jebediah auto insurance. Well now, maybe I matched him with say Liberty mutual as like insurance Per provider. Right? So now I put Jebediah on hold. I called liberty mutual I bring them on the line. They answer. I say Hey, Betty. This is Thompson. I have Jebediah on the line, he's interested in car insurance in the state of Florida. When you're ready, I can bring them on the line and and hand them over. Yeah. I'm ready. Thompson. Great. Boom. I connect in Jebediah now I say, hey, Jebediah You still with me. Yeah I'm here Thompson. Great Jebediah. I have Betty from Liberty. She's gonna be your you know, your agent and get you that free quote now. Hope you guys have a great day. I'm gonna drop from the line. I disconnect That sort of creates a third black. Right? We'll call it. So it's important to be able to see the difference because What happens is in our business, a lot of payments are on der duration right? And I'm sure you guys have heard this. Hey, on a two minute duration or a three minute duration So once we transfer, it's critical we have to know how long did that call go for after we disconnect the. Make sense.

Host 1: So critical You know, I spoke on speed lead hyper or critical that if I in just the lead a lot of our partners are posting these things at real time Api and we're digesting them into our dial.

Client 3: So they post it right now, on eastern time, twelve fifty Pm, they wanna see that literally two seconds later, I'm dialing it at twelve fifty dot zero two. Right? Like you know, they wanna know that speed lead is critical because if not, somebody else dialogue on fast and they're the god that's gonna sell.

Host 2: Right? Beautiful. We also deals you also do any coaching for your team like beyond beyond is like high level metrics, do you get it into the content of the call as well?

Client 3: Oh, for sure. Yeah. We we record every call that's important. You know, we you have to be able listen to the calls certainly.

Client 3: Yes. We have a full with other that...

Host 2: But you But who does that? Do you do that there's no or does that and how does the coaching work insulin?

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, we have a Qa department that listens to the calls, and then they do a score card, we have a global scorecard card for a business over the time, we know what's important to grade on. And then know, they they send that score cord into a portal where our agent can see what their grade is on that particular call. And then the the coach that is assigned to them can see that call as well. Right? In that grade, And then basically, based on, you know, if it's an a, they're not even gonna reach out to the agent. Like, hey, you passed your you're good. But if it's a d, well, they're gonna, you know, then look at the score them yourselves are sort of alerted within the portal. They're gonna review that, and then the coach is the one that talks. To that agent and has the one on one coaching to say, Hey, Here's where you start. You didn't rebuttal. You didn't do this or that. Right? You know, I would say There is no dial out that does a full transcription of the calls like, writes it out. You know, if you're building a dial, that could be a really good feature. I mean, that would be critical to me right now is you know, if somehow you could transcribe the call as well.

Host 2: Interesting, why why would that be good for you?

Client 3: Because then I can set parameters as to hey, you know here's the the rebuttal that I want them to say and I can almost, like, distinguish hey, on these calls, we did report Right? On these calls, they didn't use the rubber. You see what I'm saying? So it's almost like a smart, you know, solution to be able to know, hey, where are we failing? Like, where I can almost... tell from Mike how long the transcription is? Like, where are we falling off? Like, maybe that script needs to be tweaked a little bit. You follow me Right little bit that Qa department that grades agents.

Host 2: Like, how many qa do you have agent? All the other the way around? So I mean, we try to qa a one out a thirty call.

Host 2: Got it. You have roughly one Qa p agents.

Client 3: Also so like yeah I An agent can make you know, roughly a hundred and fifty calls or like a predictive die in an hour. Right? So our expectation is that, you know, Qa is is then, you know, trying to listen to, you know, ultimately, like, five of the Yeah.

Client 3: Now some of them are only twenty seconds. Right? Some of them our longest calls in our business typically you're like three minutes at the longest. Interesting.

Host 2: Can you know about the the which stirring in, like, the bolt. Do you use that as well personally?

Client 3: Yeah. So I mean, whisper is, you know, where only the agent can hear. Right? So only the direct person that's within the dial can hear me. So If if you and Jebediah were on a phone call, because you had called Jebediah on the dial, and I actually whisper it, like, you know, if I was listening as a coach, and I heard Jebediah say something. I could almost like, feed you the rebuttal flow, like I could say, hey, vote. Say this. Right? And like Jebediah would not hear me, but you would hear. Try it's almost like if you were on a blind date and you had your your airpods and and Jebediah was feeding you the good lines to tell your girlfriend. Right?

Client 3: Ultimately, you would hear but not the customer. Whereas barges is Everyone can hear me now. Like bo in means like you know, both parties can hear and you would only really use that if, like, they're asking for like, manager assistant.

Host 2: Right. And how often do they do that I'd say bo in.

Client 3: I'd say probably you know, look, we make, you know, hundreds of thousands of dials a day I'd see that that probably happens forty or fifty times a day. Right? You know and then I'd say like, wi whispering you know probably three to four hundred times a day.

Host 1: Sorry how many calls did you make in a day? Overall, you know, hundreds a thousands.

Client 3: So you know, on con somewhere between, like, a hundred and three hundred k every day, yeah.

Host 1: Okay. Awesome.

Host 1: And it's how many times was whisper mode happen?

Client 3: Maybe, you know, like I said, you know, I'm not the one with So, you know, don't quote me, but I'd say probably, you know, three four five hundred times. Right? You know, And and then, you know, maybe the board to then talk to the client, maybe forty or fifty.

Host 1: Got it. You ticket.

Client 3: I do, you know, know that we set this I just wanna be transferred I do only have about two, three minutes and then some others are probably gonna join me on another Zoom call so I do apologize just not good.

Host 2: So let's let let's wrap this up. Then Not only. Do you... Anything you dislike about so dislike is, you know, Probably, you know, I'd say some of the the scripted, like, the way that you lay out the scripting.

Client 3: Right? You know, it's it's almost like an Iv module it's like, hey, drop this in and then there's like a drawn line. And then it's like, here's another little bubble of like, he... Here's what's gonna happen next. And then here's a line over here a lot over to here. I don't like that setup. Like, almost like, you know, because you almost need to know a little bit of Html code to, like, be a true resourceful person. Now I do. Right? But but I would say, you know, for some of my my lower level colleagues that I want to be able to make changes to the scripts they just don't have that expertise. And so it makes it challenging. So I would say the most dumb down opportunity that you can make scripting would be best for probably the people that you would be selling into. If if you follow what I'm saying.

Host 2: Yeah. Totally me.

Client 3: I'm so right.

Client 3: Well, and then then I would say Some of their Api functionality is not good. Right? Like, a big thing for us, you know, to be, you know, compliant and all that. Like, we wanna hold our data know, we need to hold our data for five years to for safety dry. And so some of that is a little cumbersome, whereas some some other you know, dollars like the Api is really easy, you know? But but some of their Api integrations are a bit more like I said, robust and, you know, they they don't like to speak with with some systems. Yeah.

Host 2: just I really had to understand your a use case. You mostly inbound.

Client 3: Mostly outbound. Yes. I guess an example the it's one back we've made know, fifty two thousand outbound calls, and inbound calls, we've got a thousand two hundred.

Client 3: So fifty two thousand to twelve hundred. Yeah.

Host 2: Got it. Great. Awesome tip...

Host 2: Alright.

Client 3: Well thank you so much because it's a missed coal and their returning call. Yeah. Makes sense.

Host 2: Okay Well, thank you so much. Then i super appreciate your time today. Have you have a great one.

Client 3: Yes. Thank you guys Yeah.

Host 2: Thank you
