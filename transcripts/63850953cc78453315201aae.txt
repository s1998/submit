Client 2: Hi. Can you hear me?

Host 1: Yes. Yes.

Client 2: Very no college for thanksgiving. Do you celebrate thanksgiving?

Host 1: I do. Yeah. Yeah. It was really good. Bit of a break on Thursday for the holiday. Had some family come over. So it was it was nice back to work on Friday. That team the team is not based in the Us have the team doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving.

Client 2: So we're... Oh Yeah.

Host 1: But it was great. It was a great one time to to turn off That's great.

Client 2: I we don't get Friday off. But usually, what ends up happening is everyone is like, It's fine will be okay.

Client 2: And then like, Thursday morning, when the thanksgiving craziness starts. All of a sudden everyone starts calling out for Friday, and everyone's like, okay. So None of us would be working tomorrow anyway.

Client 2: Yeah. Ninety percent of the team was The ops team was regularly staffed. All the other teams outside of that night percent were all. So on the Friday.

Client 2: Friday.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I would say, like, if maybe half the team's has gone half of businesses, maybe just take Friday off as well. So it's just slower day in general.

Client 2: That's a slow day.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. I decided I was like, I could do that thing where, like, I'm here. And I've pops up I'll be ready. Then I'd like No. Does the chaos on my house. And I was like, I don't think they're gonna let you a separate of my computer for longer than like five seconds, and so I should just call out. That was good. Did you eat any good food?

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Of course. We you know, I think we had a couple turkeys. We have a know, decently sized, family.

Host 1: So two Turkeys. Yeah. And you know, a lot of good food. It was it was just a good time. And then football, like, you know, I don't know if you're in up, but...

Client 2: Yeah I've heard it's very popular and thanksgiving.

Host 1: I mean, Yeah. It was it was a lot of football for the day, a lot of eating and hanging out. So, yeah, It's just good to not think about anything, but what was going on, so was good.

Client 2: That's great. Good to hear that.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Cool. So in full disclosure, I'm a little bit behind on my email I know you sent me a response to the most recent email?

Host 1: That's your question for Luke Craig.

Client 2: Yes. But I'm reading it now. Oh, no. I That would have actually been really cool.

Host 1: Would it what did you miss?

Client 2: You said we run our last engagement for the community and orbit tomorrow, would you like to be included in the opt experience opt into to experience tool, first yes I would have been I was just gonna add you, you know, without asking but I thought that wouldn't be, that wouldn't be right.

Host 1: So anyways, I'll I'll still add you in our next that goes out. First thing next year you can you'll be in there.

Client 2: So... Okay. Awesome. That would be really helpful. Thank you.

Client 2: And thank you for answering my and two. So the... I've had a very broad conversation with one person on my team about the tool. And I forgot to add her to this conversation actually. Because she had another specific... Another set of specific questions as well.

Client 2: And she is the one who runs our matching team. Although she has recently taken over the matching team. So I'm still giving her a little bit of time to, like, catch up on all those things. Something I think that would be really helpful next week we're going through performance reviews this week. So it's really crazy. But next week, if we... When we choose to meet again, I'd love to invite her to that conversation just so we can get a sense of where her questions are and she will ask given more specific questions than I do because she is in the weeds and I think at that point for me, the biggest thing is, like, because she's the one running the team, I need her to feel the most confident possible in us making a shift like this. And so the decision I would be able to make would be after she has a chance to interact with you all and ask you the questions. And then we'd be able to determine and how to move forward or not.

Client 2: Okay. This is probably not the ideal scenario because we did hop on today. And I should have definitely let her know and then I gave her forty things to do this morning. But I think next week would be the best time for me to add her to the conversation Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. No. That that works. So you said she's basically leading up the matching going forward.

Host 1: Correct. Yes. So do you think in that case Let's let's put something in the books for next week we can invite her. And then I guess, well, I guess, first of all, yeah. When one works for you, to to put something in in for next week.

Client 2: Let me pull up her calendar too because i'm we come look at both people's calendars. Okay. Samantha She's like, an all sorts. She's like crazy. I don't how she does.

Host 1: What's her role? Exactly? Is it is it actually, like, matching lead or or what exactly is the role?

Client 2: She runs two teams. One as the instructor success team. So so she looks all of the recruiting, and then promoting and Sometimes the termination of instructors that we have to do.

Client 2: So she's got a couple people under her there, and then she runs a second team, which is most recently, which is a student matching team, and so they're responsible for doing all of the student structure matching when a new customer on board, or when an instructor like leaves or parent chooses of the different transitions. So she does Those are the two big teams as she leaves.

Host 1: It's no.

Client 2: Wonder if I should. Yeah. I think. Okay. So for next week, Tuesday. At two looks good.

Host 1: So the sixth at to Yes.

Host 1: Eastern. Yep. He's... So two pm eastern Okay.

Host 1: Perfect. Sorry no. I just larry. Okay. Should I should i make that... I'll I'll block out an hour if we don't go an hour that's fine. Is that totally.

Client 2: And then let me send you her email address? Okay.

Host 1: And then I'll put it ray the invitation. I didn't spell anything. Let me know he bounces this back. So I've gone ahead and sent out that calendar invite for the sixth at at two Pm eastern And if I get a bounce back on that, I'll let you know But it looks like it looks like.

Client 2: Cool. Accepted it.

Host 1: Okay. Great. In in just in front for that meeting, so it be useful. Obviously, just to answer your questions that Samantha would have on this and just say, hey, this maker feel confident that this thing could transition, but also share run through a demo of the product again, just kinda start from crotch with her and and go over, and then maybe follow on any other questions that you had on the scheduling.

Client 2: Yeah. So I think what we'll do is looking up gonna look up our old emails really quickly. Because there's probably some stuff I can forward to her to read. Know there is one detailed email that you wrote that I. Great. So I'll send her the one that you sent me ten days ago. Which was about the scheduling and rem matching.

Client 2: Send her also her this whole trail to read through, and then included in the very first email you had also put us i deck together, so Have her review that as well. And then So she'll prep for that conversation. And then an overview of the product would be helpful. And from there, she'll start asking questions.

Host 1: Okay. Sounds good. That sounds like a good plan ahead. Any any else outstanding any questions that you had a account on any of you the notes or anything else from from previous that you think would help us, you know, essentially wouldn't samantha over here.

Client 2: I think I think Probably a little bit more clarity around what the you all had mentioned that you will be launching a new product that or a new addition to the product that would allow us to review the matches where they get sent out, and that's happening either the end of this year or early next year. I think focusing on that is something that would be really helpful.

Host 1: Okay. Yep. Parts hop. Top matches. We are currently doing that now. Starting into transition to do it a bit more scale. So certainly, I would say, end your first thing next year. Yeah.

Client 2: So we about that more would be really helpful and then Even if there's, like, an intermediary step before that, like, if there's a... Well, that's kind the same thing. It just needs to be phrase differently. So one of the things that we had been talking about was like, oh, I wish there is a way for someone to input which is exactly what you're doing. So once to input customer information in and then get recommended a few different instructors who match that file.

Client 2: Mh. That would allow us to still feel like we have control over that is that I don't know if that is a functionality that does exist for you all or not, but that might something I'm just knowing her she will probably asked that question. It's okay the answer is now. Because you have your own product too.

Host 1: You where you input information about let's say instructors and students or anyone and then recommend matches before doing anything with them.

Client 2: More than one. So based on your current product right now, when a customer would sign up, and then they would tier what's most important to them. Right now one in instructor is given as a potential match. Right? And that would be who we what we look at before we say approve, go ahead and send this out. Ours Because we've david their instructors a little bit. We have to walk back on some other the things and and be a little bit more hands on. And so if it's instead possible for you all to give us a few different matches that would be interesting.

Host 1: We can do that.

Host 1: Okay. Great. And and so there's... We have one one matches right We can recommend top matches. We can even recommend if you're gonna do one to one connections. With, like, one instructor in one student. like, here's three potential matches, and you're gonna decide which one to do that one join connection with And then we also do group matches. So if we do, you know, up to let's say eight people in a group, we can recommend those eight people in matches, and we can also edit in in add subtract, and then we can send out that group match. So I think we would have that type of capability that you're asking about.

Client 2: Cool. Okay. That would be something it will probably come up for her and I'll let you answer that exactly the way that you have right now. I think those are the only the only question that I had right now.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: And I just need to then depending on how she reacts need to consider one whether we move forward or not? And be direct with you all about that because grateful for how much time you spent with me on this?

Host 1: Yeah. Hey it's been great to to kinda dive into this because I know it helps luke with scheduling questions because we're getting into a lot more of the el learning space. So it's been good on my end. And it sounds like Match making is is a pretty big no brainer for all for for you in terms of how you want to do this. It's just the the switching and the transition is probably the biggest question mark. And then also scheduling do you think Samantha is gonna have as many scheduling questions as as you had when went in with Luke Yes.

Host 1: Okay? So matching scheduling and full product demo and just see where she like to take it. Yep. Is there any reason that you can see because you mentioned this process might might take a while. Obviously, this is just you know, you all wanna start implementing some stuff. But what would be the reason that you all would say, you know, decide not to implement.

Client 2: It would be mostly based off of whether we think that there are just too many nuances within what we're doing right now to be able to effectively transition over. That would be the biggest thing. As I shared before, there's some things that we're like, trying to un learn with the things set happened over the past two years. And some things on learning takes more time. And so we can't rip the band data off of some some processes we built. Others we can. And so for me, if the ratio of, like, this will cause way more harm in our matching process than it will support. That specifically related to the nuances, that would make me say, okay. We are not doing this then it's not the right for us. And I think that would be the only one. Because right now for us, the the demos and the details. So So it's it's essentially the nuances with match making.

Client 2: Drilling and matching. Yeah.

Host 1: Scheduling and match making, The nuance is in terms of just your current workflow in the way that you do that and how this would smooth transition being the number one thing. Okay. I guess, yeah. Well, I guess we just have to dive in a bit deeper to see how exactly because right now, it seems as probably a bit unclear. Still in terms of how that would take place. Am I right? Correct. Would there be any questions that you have in terms of hey, you know, Samantha loves this. We wanna take the next steps let's decide to take this in a transition and try to implement this with junior learning what be the first nuance that we'd would have to overcome there?

Client 2: It would be So trying to find a workaround around to some things. It would be probably related to How The expectations that our instructors currently have with how scheduling occurs.

Host 1: Okay. In their current. Go ahead.

Client 2: Our current instructors are really bad updating their calendars and their requirements with us, and they're like, time commitments. So it always turns into a ton of back and forth with them, which is, like, super time and inefficient.

Host 1: K.

Client 2: I don't know how to answer that question yet actually.

Client 2: Okay. I think I would depend on how Samantha responds. I think my role in that conversation just so you have disclosures like gonna write down those nuances. We didn't talk about them, but I'm gonna break them down because that's check for me to determine is this an nuance that we think? We can't get over? Or is this one that we actually can't get over.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. I know Luke is super excited about this and all the notes that provided, our Ceo Bi g you know, loves learning. So we we would absolutely love to make this work in any way possible. So... yeah, guess, once we have this conversation with Samantha, Well we'll take it from there. Hopefully, this is something that's... Yeah. Makes sense for us.

Client 2: Yeah. I'm excited. Other forward to the conversation she's very She's got her eye on the prize and she's always looking for ways to make things better. And so Oh, preface the conversation with her as well. And I did tell a few other folks like Anecdotally just around. Like, well, so Nice talked about it as well. And really like what you guys are working on. Just hoping there's a good fit.

Host 1: So Perfect. Sounds good. Well, I put that in our calendars. If there's anything in the means time that comes up let me know, but looking forward to to Tuesday.

Client 2: Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Host 1: Yeah. Definitely. Alright alright, Gotcha. I'll talk to you soon then.

Client 2: Okay Bye.
