Host 1: Hey Denisha?

Client 2: Hey hello?

Host 1: Hey, Richard, Leaandra.

Client 3: Do?

Client 2: How are you??

Client 3: How are you?

Host 1: Nice monday. Back. Tuesday for you.

Client 3: What's that.

Host 1: Just a a productive Monday. You don't get a lot of those so it's good.

Client 3: Trying to get a few deals signed off before the end of the year.

Host 1: Hopefully more than a few, but...

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Exactly.

Host 1: Person left. So...

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: So it's only like two weeks left, so it's a super short. Yep. Yep.

Client 3: Very good. So out with a document. I just wanted it talk to you about the the reviews the shout outs and the letters. I've never seen that. This very interesting. I'll I'll tell my thoughts. One hand, I think to myself know, how do I rely on the... As I i haven't actually board yet. How do I rely on the views reviews that I read. Because there they're compensated reviews. On the other hand, I like it because I have a big proponent for. You know, spreading the love if you really like something and shouting out about it. Etcetera etcetera and I think that you know, helps the will go around. That's interesting. I've never say that before. Now It's funny. I guess we we've done it in different ways and i believe we've held pricing for customers. Site hey do a case study for us. We won't increase your pricing. But we'll give you more So if you think about this not really different. But I guess why you did it quite extroverted.

Host 1: So actually, I used it. So a couple little bit background. We're definitely not gonna, like, hold you to it. And then if you don't do it, be like, hey. We're increasing your pricing. It it honestly is more of like a gift to get so it's not just like we're giving...

Client 3: No. That.

Host 1: No. I wasn't thinking yeah.

Client 3: I was just contextual it into What what we've done which is same side but different.

Host 1: Right? Mh. And we actually use... I used to have my because I honestly, just came up with that kind of on my own, but We used to do the case study, but we've actually found that when people were organically just like kind of writing posts about using Mosaic on Linkedin. It led to one a lot more conversation and then us kind of like knowing, so definitely a great tactic, I mean we have many case studies that I don't think we're trying to do them for, like, every single customer because it does take up a lot of our time honestly. Well, so potentially reach out to customers even if they don't have in there, but the Linkedin post, honestly for you guys might be a good play as well because that's where we hear a lot of people are hearing about, Mosaic is just on Linkedin their networks.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it it is interesting. I mean, I was thinking about it from context conversation of bit. It's just collecting place. The linkedin post is legs less extroverted. The the review why. Yeah. Just gotta be, you know, my my my way obviously he was do I rely organize reviews?

Host 1: Well, they definitely. Because people could leave batteries if they wanted to.

Client 3: No, I know. I if they're getting tight. If they're getting, you know it's the probability of the giving a good review if they're being paid to. Is high. But anyway?

Host 1: I was just...

Client 3: Yeah. I had I was thinking it was was quite interesting. And it was it was sunday afternoon when i was reviewing a contract. So It's thinking this quite interesting we're you know, as I said we're in the same.

Client 3: In the same business. So learn out of these conversations things that do Mean we even. Got it. We we have it even. Looked at using G two or whatever, which is I think it's too detriment. Think we need just start doing that. Because we do. Don't know that many customers with our customers love products. Really love that product. Would write great things. So we're crazy that we haven't engaged it's definitely should.

Host 1: I know they make a difference. Like, one one of our competitors have any on their d to at all and it definitely has attracted and and just made them look at...

Client 3: Yeah. I made I read a ton. I read a ton of reviews. Very early at the pace. Which also you know, it allows me to accelerate the whole prices.

Client 3: Not doing. Is good for you.

Host 1: Yeah. Love it. So I know that the last thing is the Cto security sign off.

Client 3: Why he's he's doing he's he's doing a couple of He's closing out a few reviews. In inbound. Customers So once he's done that, he'll get on your Got outbound. That yeah. Sure it's fine. Keeps pretty you guys guys would have to get this right otherwise you would get us.

Client 3: Yeah. Just have to have to just go Have to get sign off which I... As as I should have to get sign off as well. So Perfect.

Host 1: And I mean, I'm assuming the call with my get scan i went well, but just wanna check.

Client 3: He's drunk aid.

Host 1: I mean...

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: It.

Client 3: He was super positive. I mean, You know, He's probably he highlighted some of the things that written there views it's a bit of work to be done on how the materials presented look nice fantastic you know similar someone i mean, as I said, it's a he and P and i is single point of failure. So your product is only is good as we we're able to. Onboard. And use it. Otherwise, know, you your product will file not because of the product, but because of the user. Because it's only one of this but it it was was all it's all really good. Okay. Yeah.

Host 1: Awesome. Awesome.

Client 3: Yeah. But, yeah know, N was it was, you know, it's obviously interesting which is probably why you use it as a as a reference too because he he came out of your industry. So he was She had a he had a more experienced in advanced view of what what what was a product? What was another a good product?

Host 1: I actually haven't interacted with him. He was signed up by my colleague, Selwyn, but I know that there was like this Fp and a, strategic finance slack channel, that air base runs that you should look into actually, but he's definitely an advocate for mosaic on that as well. So Yep.

Client 3: Yep.

Client 3: So we ask... Then he was asking me if he took the chance to ask me a few things he was good. You I was he gave up his time. So nice.

Client 3: Post. Happy to do that.

Host 1: Always go to network in the space. Yep. Doing anything to add here. I think... So I guess the last step really is just waiting on your Cto.
