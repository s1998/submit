Client 2: Mh.

Host 1: Okay. Cool. I've been a Dc a couple times a couple of friends there, but not many not many times.

Client 2: Nice so is orbit bit remotely.

Host 1: Orbit is remote. So about half in in the Us and half in Europe. So we're.

Host 1: But, our Ceo is in London, but we're we're also headquartered in in New York. Our Coo o o is in New York.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Yeah. But I'm in, Reykjavik, obviously. We're mostly east coast. Anyways, Good to connect. Yeah. And you know, it looks like you all are doing some cool things with property management, new gen home buyers, things like that, Is that essentially what you already look... What would what some of the goals are for your community really.

Client 2: Yeah. Sure. So so Dab is a is an is a home service app. You can kind of think of it as, like, Uber for home maintenance. So that's what we're building. When we Next gen for next gen, it's it's for the next generation of homeowners who like don't really meet you know what they're doing or, like, you know, need to just like, they need help. And so they would rather just, like, do things through and Adam. We we we... It's digital property management. So that's what we're doing. I lead marketing a Doggy So a part of our marketing efforts is can you a building because we we really view this tool is something we wanna spread we want it to grow exponentially horizontally in community. So, like, people finding out about Dab from their neighbors and, like, referring each other and just kind of, like, that community growth. Yeah. So I'm just interested to learn. I don't really have any any specific goals out of this. I just joined in December. So I'm kind of and doing the lay of the land of the current tools and systems that they're using and seeing you know, what Valuable to onboard for them.

Host 1: Yeah. No. That that sounds really good. It sounds like Dab like, very much needed especially for days generation were, like, less into the trade and just more and so like, less do it yourself.

Host 1: So it sounds like you probably guys have some some cool growth there. Well, yeah. I mean, on my end. You know, I put this in for thirty minutes, you know, would be good to dive into some of these goals? I'll show you on the platform. I'll see what I'll tell you would or but has going on. Probably some good use cases like insurances, you know, if orbit would make a good partner with you. Does that sound good?

Client 2: Yeah. That sounds great.

Host 1: Okay. So... Okay. Customer community. Is it... Is probably, like a paid networking subscription like, what what is your model essentially like, what are some Kpis that you have really to to grow this? You're looking to maximize the number of connections that you're having Like, what what do you were trying to out of community at this point?

Client 2: Referrals.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Like, we want people to refer Dab to others in their community.

Host 1: K. So referrals and you believe that by connecting people currently in your community that it will lead to more referrals.

Client 2: Potentially. I don't really know I'm just learning about Like, I don't really know what the specific use case would be for us. I think A better idea might be for you just give me a broader overview of the tool. And I can kind of, like, fill in like... I it's it's hard for me to just have this conversation without really knowing you're product Sure.

Host 1: No makes sense. I'll I'll give a high level overview just add some context. Before dive into anything else. So what orbit is were an Ai powered match making engine. So what that means is community managers use this as a tool or a critical tool help you get results and maximize productivity doing so. So we're helping you make one one in group connections at scale. Three big things that our software does for you. The first is frictionless sign ups. So It's a one click opt in for your members or your customers or whoever you're connecting. From wherever they're currently located. There's no logins they're to set there's profiles to create we're not another community management platform or simply tool for you to use in your community. The second thing that we do is automated scheduling So we're making introductions and sending calendar invitations these one two group conversations. Between these community members based on common interest or role based on location or based on any other area that they wanna to be connected on. Third thing we do is matching criteria. So we can We have would dedicated Cs team for every one of our clients. You basically can tailor your matches in your topics that that'll just strengthen your community, get the feedback that you need and hopefully, plug it into your your own business objectives. So you said referrals our big thing. Once we start getting some data and information about what's happening in your connections in your community. Okay. How can we, you know, increase referrals? A lot of our clients or use for a demand generation or they're just using us as a value add for their paid members. So you know, they can share some good reviews and Mps scores and it gets more people to get become paid members a lot of different ways we can use that. Anyways, hopefully that adds some some added context for you.

Client 2: It does. Thank you.

Host 1: So maybe based on that, muting. Are are you are you the head of a community? Are you head of marketing or we're exactly is your focus there.

Client 2: I'm I'm head of marketing. My my primary focus at this time is horizontal of growth and marketing exponentially through community growth. But I I lead all marketing efforts.

Host 1: Okay. So in addition to referrals, what other objectives are you looking to to have. Let's say in q one twenty twenty three, the the kpi...

Client 2: My Kpis are new app downloads. End new job submissions on the app k?

Host 1: Taking some some notes. In terms of the community, is this a customer community? Is it a free community and then you you bring them on as a customer was it a paid? Can like how exactly it right now.

Client 2: It's free to download the app. And you only pay for a job. So you download the app And then you say, okay. I want my living room painted. And then you submit on the app compete my living room. And then the da team will connect you with a service probably will come out and do it. The time team will schedule it all for you. And then you pay once the work's done.

Host 1: And you're you a percentage as a marketplace.

Host 1: What's that? And you as a marketplace earn a percentage?

Client 2: Yes. We take a fee off of every off of every job.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. Is is part of anything you're doing related to revenue or is that kind of a nice added bonus if that leaves the revenue.

Client 2: We wanna be, like, I'm sorry. My my laptop time. We wanna be in the green on on everything we do, but my... But my Kpis are right now.

Client 2: Because we're we're pretty series a. My Kpis are just demonstrating the growth of the user base. So new users and new like, app activity, new job submissions. Revenue is important, but it's not the the leading Kpi at this time.

Host 1: Okay. Got it. Start for the twenty one questions over I'm just trying to make sure when I show you what it does. I can plug some of these solutions into what you're working on.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. No. That's that's great. Thank you for the questions.

Host 1: Let's see.

Client 2: In a listening to.

Host 1: Okay. Yeah. No worries. Yeah. I know you're two months in. You have you have some goals to hey. You have your Kpis So new downloads, new job submissions, new users, not necessarily focused on revenue, but, you know, activities is the biggest thing anything that you know of that you've been doing to connect the community or that darby has been doing that you're looking to change or improve I I guess what I'm asking is when when you came aware of orbit in the one two one connections that I shared what in particular of interest there?

Client 2: I... It's it's I need... I... Yeah. I'm sorry. I feel like I already so I just need to have a better understanding of what the product is. Before I can understand how how it could help us. Like, I just don't... It's hard for me to, like, have this conversation before I see the the product.

Host 1: Does that make sense? Yeah. I I just like to know exactly before I show you the product because it's just like me going through the demo. So it just helps, you know, if you have questions on something. And already you know what you're focused on, I can direct you to something within the product demo.

Client 2: Yeah. It's hard for me to say until I until see it.

Host 1: Okay. Alright. I'll I'll run through the demo with you. I'll share some things that what is like from a member perspective?

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: How big is your commute at this point?

Client 2: It is over five thousand active users at this times.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. Let me share my screen with you. And run you through some things. And then feel free to stop me at any time, and let me know if you have any questions of this. But can you see this this blue screen right here?

Client 2: Yes.

Host 1: Okay. Cool. And I just wanna check it in time. We about twenty minutes left. Are you a hard stop or do you have an extra five minutes in case we go over.

Client 2: Do have a hard stop at two thirty. I'm sorry. I have another call.

Host 1: Okay. Got it. So quick status. I I'll share with you here on this, and we should be able to finish up for sure within time, which just good know. So quick metrics that were tracking. So we're connecting hundreds of customers and tens of thousands of their community man their community members. So net promoter score is eighty seven, which is pretty high. We'd love to promote that. And then we also ask for an average rating, which is after every single match done or with connected to community members, were asking how strong was this match how good was this conversation? One the five. Or averages of four point three and then lastly, eighty seven percent are saying they want monthly matches ongoing. So typically, when community members use orbit, they love us and you wanna continue. Community managers are typically recommending as to other community managers. But just some stats to back that up In terms of where we're focused just for your added context, We're working with lot of different types of communities. So paid networking groups, b to b customer communities b see portfolios, so sequoia capital and effects Pc platform we're connecting their portfolio founder founder, phone or to investor, we're connecting silicon Valley bank customers spend desk. They have about six thousand Cfo in a paid community that they then will go up to a customer spend. We were work gonna with them a couple years in Atlas last. So just a broad range of types of companies using us to connect their communities for Yeah. Monetization, demand gen, or just a value add.

Host 1: Okay. So I'm gonna use Cfo connect as an example. Great customer ours. This is their Bend us. This is their community for Cfo Connect. And this is what it's like. With what it would be like from a Dab community member. So the first thing that they would get once you run this type of engagement, is they're gonna get an opt in email? As your branding, your colors, your logo, and everything is customizable, you have a dedicated cs to help you customize everything. But this is the first thing that they get. So here is your engagement. This is what it's out this is how it works, and then you get to set a date of when it can in by. And then at the next week after that gonna have their. They don't opt in that first email. They get a reminder. That's all these are. Once they do opt in, So you're gonna invite all of your community members to opt in, the ones that do opt in, gonna go to a sign up form. So no logins, no profiles. It's your messaging, so it's coming from you, and they're gonna spend fifteen seconds. Answering questions. What is the role, what are areas of interest? What is yours experience for industry, we can add and subtract a lot of questions, and we ask him when is a good time for you to meet? Once that's done, they get some confetti. And then within twenty four hours, our Ai does its thing. And we create a match of all your community members. So all five thousand Well, let's say half opt in everyone absent in they're gonna get a match. And then we're gonna send them an email introducing them to their match. Ellen mead jenny. This is who she is. This is expertise. This is what she said she was interested in connecting on? And then we put an invitation directly in their calendar. And then we can put their linkedin url role. If they give us that they give it to as an form, and then we even can provide conversation guy down here with ice, discussion questions. Lot of members love to use it. Some don't use it. Once that date comes up, they just click that link in our calendar. They're taken to a branded video platform. Couple of our Cs teammates put this together. But we built this in house it's it's encrypted restock certified and you can open it in a browser on your mobile, your desk there's nothing to download like Zoom. Although if your members wanted to replace it with the Zoom, you can also do that. Last step from your member. Is a feedback form. So did the chat happen did it not happen There's a bit of a cadence for no shows. We ask them rate your your conversation one to five. Any testimonials? How... You know, what else do you wanna say about this conversation? We can ask him future topics they wanna to discuss future areas of interest, so you can feed other programming for marketing efforts or anything else that you're doing for referrals. Or other events that you have, and then you can ask how often they wanna be connected monthly weekly by monthly And and that's it. That's the entire experience from your community members. There's no nowhere for them to log into. You're just using us as a tool.

Client 2: Okay. This is really helpful life have such a more clear understanding of what practice. So Okay.

Client 2: I'm glad. Do you consider Lunch club a competitor?

Host 1: Lunch club, I've I've heard them a few times. I'm gonna say no. Because they don't get brought up enough. So we I wouldn't consider the competitor.

Client 2: Okay. So when you are deploying, like, the orbit experience into a community. Are you working with the dataset that the your client gives you or are you connecting them with people outside of there? Dataset.

Client 2: Does that make sense?

Host 1: Yes. We are working solely with Your community. So Okay you have give five thousand, we're gonna work with your community. Where we're tool for you to engage community.

Client 2: Got it.

Host 1: You as as let's say you know, marketing leader, head of community, community manager, can automatically put you into our home community in orbit and then we send out engagements. And then you can connect with, like a community manager at Hubspot community manager at atlas last, maybe if that's what you get connected with. And then you can have those conversations ongoing addition to your own community.

Client 2: Mh. Okay. That's that's really helpful. Sorry. I'm just thinking. I think it's really interesting it's really cool. I think There's, like, gotta to be I just love. I really like it. I wanna think about how we could use it.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Can you... Do you have any, like, B to c examples?

Host 1: B c examples do how do businesses use this in a customer community?

Host 1: Yeah. Me quick bring something up. So mean we are b, But you mean a customer that has B c, I can definitely you Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. That's what I meant.

Host 1: Yeah. Done. Let let me let me bring something up real quick. I have a case study Nikita they are b c, quite a few Cfo connect also Okay. Sorry. This is just the one I have right now. I have other b, but Nikita. And An excuse all the data. So Nikita there are customer bars they just renewed for a second year. So they are helping software development, so they have consumers you know, becoming customers of theirs and they actually have a paid community as well. So what they're doing is they wanna keep their Bd customers happy. Because they're they're paying them on a monthly basis. You wanna get a lot of feedback, to yeah have discussions with their customers and provide more value. Then they wanna connect their current customers with prospects for demand generation. So we're helping them facilitate that. So they... Their pain points they have a lot of customers. It's a lot of time connecting these one one in group conversations, they don't really not to plug this into their growth, and they don't have a really good way to manage their feedback and a good dashboard. All these things are where orbit is helping them specifically provide. I can maybe round up a couple other Bd examples, but this is one this is testimonials from their members after a meeting. And I can send you this case study as well.

Client 2: Yeah. That would be great.

Host 1: So Yeah. Demand Gen is one. Yep. Community manager are using orbit as a tool. So especially in twenty twenty three as you know, maybe some budgets are being tight in or whatever, you still need to have lot of like a really engaged commute to to inspire growth probably more important than So we as one tool guess, in your arsenal, we wanna help you get those results and just be way more effective and more productive. You know, add scale, then right now either individuals that you currently have. And we'd like to explore that within, like, thirty days. So we start running engagements within a week, Let's get a lot of data and feedback and see how we can maximize this going forward.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. I I really love it. I wanna think I'm gonna... Yeah. If you could send me that duck great. Wanna think about there's There's definitely a use case here for us I like think... I need to, like, I use a brainstorm with all a little bit. But, like, I... Like, I want to... like, part of my job here is to build the Dab community. And that is going to require, like, facilitating interactions between community members. With the goal of course of, like, leading to more business somehow. So I need to think about But this is really interesting. This has been really helpful.

Host 1: Good. I'm glad and I know you have a lot of stuff to think about. I'll send you this deck I'll send you this case study and then let me know what else you need.

Host 1: Okay. I'm mindful time. And obviously, it sounds like you find orbit bit of value you you tell me what's the best way that we can work together to get orbit in your hands? I guess, what what makes sense timeline wise, there anyone else on your team from product or community? That should look at this demo as a next step.

Client 2: I think I just need to I need to spend some time thinking about how we could enter incorporate it Maybe if you wanna follow it me, like, a week or so, that would be good. To give me, like, a time frame to to think about it. Then we can go from there.

Host 1: Okay. That works. Is your specific timeline? Is this something that you're looking to execute in January in q one, what you know what that is?

Client 2: I don't... I'm just moving his fast. It's it's an early stage start. So I'm just you know, you know how it is.
