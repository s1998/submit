Host 1: Hey, kyle.

Client 2: Leaandra going.

Host 1: Good. How are you? Happy Friday?

Client 2: Yeah. I'm ready. You Same.

Host 1: It's been a long, honestly three weeks. So week the short week will be really nice.

Client 2: There we go. You got a code on where where are you at? You said you're central time.

Host 1: Right? Yeah. I mean, this is kind of a necessary, but I like to be comfy, but I also like to not turn on the heater.

Client 2: Oh nice there go.

Host 1: I'm in austin. And it it's very... Honestly, it's pretty cold. It's been, like, under like four use of fifties all week. So yeah. It definitely is colder than I thought when I moved here.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Where'd did do you move from?

Host 1: La. So I've never really experienced seasons. But yeah. How are you? How's everything going on your end? Do you end your day or do you sell stuff going on?

Client 2: Oh, yeah No. There's... There's there's stuff going on. It's so i just going Cool.

Host 1: I don't know if you saw my email that I sent over within the last hour or so, but I did get the second year down a little bit. Yeah... Actually, my manager realized that that was a little bit off face. So I guess, that was just like our standard of obviously, like, ideal dollar retention is twenty percent, but just knowing that it is a two year, it should be lower. So I reduced the thirty two on that one.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. That'll help. I was a little nervous just about the optics of going to them. With a big increase i. I just... I think I I'd probably prefer the two years, and I was worried they'd say, well, I'll just go for one. And and let's let's just kinda see more pricing go. So I I I think that'll help me And I I did I I did talk to Mike. So thanks thanks for that. That was helpful. I know they came on early, but but went through that as you know, I'm sure went back through pretty recently. And it sounds like it was a good experience with with try for such that he actually thinks charge was pretty good.

Host 1: And I think it's because he's he's only the used charge Mosaic.

Client 2: I shared him that it's not as good without it. So selling I love it.

Host 1: Thanks.

Client 2: But I think that's I think that's all. I mean, What would probably be I I want us to keep moving forward I mean for me, My hope from a timeline perspective is that we can kick things off the week of the twenty eight.

Client 2: Mh. And I would use the time in between. I know was a short week But I've already been circulating Cal intake so that we can kinda hit the ground running with clarity on our end. So Yeah. Do you... Was one of this... What what if you put in the two year route. Into that order form. And then would you send my way for... Can you do it through like, a Doc design or something?

Host 1: That's exactly what we do. I guess also, Kyle just wanted to understand, Is it just the predictability? Or or what is gearing you towards like the... I mean, obviously, two years are great, but just kinda curious from your perspective. What makes the two your more attractive.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, I think it's just a certainty. It's one less thing to to worry about and in effectively sort of c with but charging with what we have now. And I think that makes some sense as well.

Host 1: So... Cool.

Client 2: Alright. Perfect. Nothing too much. But Those are some things.

Host 1: Yeah. I don't... Do did you have a chance to look at the the doc... Or the Google... Whatever it is, Microsoft. Document whatever.

Client 2: Oh, yeah. With the... Yeah. I did. I I had... I didn't have a chance to review it review it. And so maybe maybe he send it through and if there's an issue with, you know, where red lines or something are needed, you always, circle back on that, but at least then there's an option to to look at it as is.

Client 2: Cool. I'm just not sure and getting contracts most days and and some are written in a pretty balanced way and others are at other ends of the spectrum, and I don't quite know what to expect here, but if it's if it's pretty benign. And that way, I i'll have it to be able to sign and there material things Like I can always circle back with you, but if we could, just given where we are, if we could hold that November twenty eighth time. I I think Then agreements balance, I can I can get signed tonight.

Host 1: Okay. So let me actually... I just wanna make sure you guys have like an accounts payable email because that's like, one thing that I just put hours before.

Client 2: Yeah. Would you have... In addition to mine, would you add accounting at pre dot com.

Host 1: Okay. Perfect. And then anything else on here that Like, I guess we can just go through right now. I I will actually say that I know that I've heard feedback from Some our mers that are agreement can be a little bit one. So I might actually just preemptively preemptively go ahead and get approval to change some of these weren't, like either party because I know we're fine with it. If you guys change it, and I'd rather just change it preemptively that way we can get it signed, but I think there's, like, There's like a section that people always change it to like, be either if they put either party So I think it is a little bit one side on on some ends.

Client 2: Yeah. That would probably help.

Host 1: I mean, especially with, like, the sensitivity of information that would be there.

Client 2: We we have obligations to customers the with respect to to how we're gonna handle like, you know, effectively Pii. So the bar is kind of hi there. Like, we have requirements that we provide you know, like, non disclosure that's at least you know, at a minimum level and all all those good things. So... And then the Let's see. For contract date. So all of twenty three elephant forty Makes sense. And then so we're generate thirty day terms. If that works, Yeah.

Host 1: It we have, like, actually auto renewal terms in here, but if I think it's pretty standard to do, like, a thirty day.

Client 2: Notice renewal.

Host 1: Yeah. And I could even just put that in the language. I spelled it wrong. And renew one more.

Client 2: Yeah. And Leaandra I know we've got a little bit more time in this meeting that we probably when otherwise go. If you scroll up, I can just kinda look at it. Just at the beginning of the actual terms I can just glance at it as we go. I'll read it more thoroughly but I'll just kinda skim for the more material ones.

Host 1: Cool. I have your Po box. That's what I found online. I wasn't sure.

Client 2: If that was. Forty three. Yeah. Into Leaandra, can we go thirty days there?

Host 1: Which one?

Client 2: In section two under payment.

Host 1: Oh, Net thirty.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. I just have I have to ask about that, but I think there's be fine. So me just typed in here in the last afterwards.

Client 2: You happen to know and you don't really need to tell me sometimes sensitivity around five on marketing d know, if Fm x has I guess I can look at the website here. Well I can see if it's part of We honestly have an...

Host 1: You're talking like having us put your name on the website.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: We don't typically do that, or we haven't done it recently. Like, I know the ones that we have on our website. We've does customers for, like, a super long time? There's not that many on here, but we would definitely ask you if we if we did that.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. That would help.

Client 2: I think when it's not like a core tool, it's okay. But sometimes when it's core, there's some sensitivity to it.

Client 2: Good scrolled. Yeah. Go ahead and scroll. Yeah. So can you run a little bit, I just wanna ring confidentiality and maybe that's a spot where we might use something mutual if it's not.

Host 1: And we do have that Nda signed from before as well, but yeah. Typically, if we didn't have that generating sales process, it's covered in here. And can you scroll some?

Client 2: Okay. Go ahead. Okay. Yeah. Go.

Host 1: You fast.

Client 2: Well just I'm just going for that that more material stuff there. Leaandra, what's what's applications about? Like, what's that seventeen?

Host 1: Let me actually see if I can pull Denisha on.

Client 2: if if we choose to install Oh, yeah.

Host 1: I think I have someone else about this. It's like, if you guys use a third party and then it connects to Mosaic.

Host 1: Know Mean, like, limits our liability from, like, that third party or something like that.

Client 2: Yeah. Got. Got it. Do you... From what we've talked about, are there any Is this just basically saying we think for like Mosaic is gonna be liable for something maybe on the on the Quickbooks or paychecks or charge the end.

Host 1: I think this is more like preemptively in case tools end up connecting to us. Like kind of like, how Salesforce in the beginning didn't have any tools and now they have, like, look and all those things connecting to sales like, I think this is more just preemptive preemptive. Because I don't think any tools really connect to us at this point.

Client 2: Okay. Great Go ahead. Okay. Yeah. I think we I think we covered it. I'll i'll accelerate read through it. More closely tonight.

Host 1: And feel free to email me if you find anything. I mean, honestly not doing anything. So I can turn around your Doc again pretty quickly. But I'll I'll put this one through Doc, just if everything's... I just need to change that net thirty Denisha told me that's good to go. So if that's the only thing then, then, yeah, we can get it taken care of Okay.

Client 2: Great. Yeah. I'm just gonna set up my desk and crank away for a while. So I'll get to as i can. And then Leaandra what do you think What does availability look like for the week in the twenty eighth?

Host 1: So as of right now, I pulled up rcs like, I have you guys in there and then there's, like, two x spots beyond that. So it's not totally booked up yet. I will say they told us to really reiterate this today. That just schedule your scoping call with the data team has quickly as you can and with K team, you'll get that invite right after kick call because that is a little bit of what take, you know, we can do a kickoff golf call really easily, but then the data team is, like, you know, has a lot of work. So the quicker you can do that, the faster we can move on things.

Client 2: We book it now?

Host 1: I don't think I have access to it. But let me Let me actually pull up Kilos calendar. I'll I'll send you an email with a link to book it. Yeah. I just need get that from the Cs team. Because... There's just... Yeah. There should be slots available. But, yes. Let me write that down. And then aside from that, oh, another thing that they like us for us to communicate is that we have office hours on, like, rotating objects with our current customers every Thursday at ten Am Pacific. So if you can, I know it's asking a lot but like, locking off your calendar or just like knowing that we have them then that way you can attend if you want to. They're super helpful and they answer a lot of like, you know, the similar questions that people have.

Client 2: Great.

Host 1: Awesome. I guess last thing I'll leave you with Kyle, we have an awesome referral program. I don't know if ever mentioned it before, but if you do have other colleague kinda like how Jack f max for you. I don't think he knows about this which she probably should because this is a newer thing. We actually pay out for opportunities. So if you know anyone in the similar field, we actually pay out five hundred dollars if they take a demo. And if they're in the right, you know, B b Saas, and then a thousand dollars of actually signed. I actually probably send this to Jericho.

Client 2: Because these of people without...

Host 1: knowing, but yeah, it's you know, really great. Referral program leads source.

Client 2: Yeah. Great. Would you send a jack?

Host 1: Sure. Yeah. That's... I should definitely do that. Because I think he sent us one more. So Cool.

Client 2: Even if he uses a just device office beer or something Yeah.

Host 1: Totally. But yeah, I mean, I guess, if you have any other questions, again, i'll be at my computer, so feel shoot him over. And then as soon as we get that, then we'll be official and I'll get you over this open calendar.

Client 2: Yeah. That sounds great.

Host 1: Cool. Awesome.

Host 1: Okay. Let me know if you have any questions, but always open, so don't feel like you can never reach out to me again. Feel like, you know, I'm a resource for you as you go through this.

Client 2: Great. I appreciate it.

Client 2: Cool.
