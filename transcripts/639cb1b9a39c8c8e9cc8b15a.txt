Host 1: For. Just for context on my end, like, I And basically trying to educate myself a little bit more exactly what it is that you guys do. I know you're a buyer intelligence platform, and you guys use some Ai and whatnot, but just for flow, I'm thinking about how I can more efficiently identify leads at the top of the funnel. Better, you know, have a higher likelihood to convert and things like that. So Right now we use Zoom info. We use sales law, Salesforce, But... Yeah, just looking a number of different, you know, tools, databases that can help us, like, better identify how they qualify leads at the top of the funnel. That's the main thing that I'm looking solve.

Client 2: Okay. Let me disconnect my bluetooth headset set. A moment. What now?

Client 2: Targets aspects. I don't know what to do. It just as I can beyond helps. Even I that's a smarter some people like another thing infant top wait a minute. No need a bad. I'm about blow. Whole my magic. I not do the people saying fantastic. They all then. Yeah. Hope your. Diligence not immediately and just sealed emails. It's how to be told just. A little and you will see how some kind of talk. I afraid minute. I'm and then linguistics and science existing data and cycle it to get some data since your fingertips decision. And you to connections on your prospects not should do when. Check out all these things. Everything we think you need to know just mail that in the bank. Have a moment mind give it picture tonight. If you still don't see the numbers you can tell me live like that.

Host 1: Very funny.

Client 2: Yeah. We to catch some people's attention. We were able to like, Wall journal and couple other big names like our business review and couple others you know, god us mentioned us. So, I did work but now I love it.

Client 2: So what we do in a in a nutshell, So I'll revolve this around your... The problem that you mentioned, it's basically Laser focusing your we are targeting. And making sure that your top of the funnel is full on the time or maybe, you know, it's more. So So if you can... Tell me what what sorts of response rates you have today and and how many members I'll be talking about in terms of working on on that approach.

Host 1: Yeah. We have four people who are actively prospecting. Reply rates vary. I would say, like, you know, eight to fifteen percent on the high end.

Client 2: Okay. And is that on, like, one to one personalized outreach or, is it more of, like campaign focused share.

Host 1: Yeah. It's more one to one.

Client 2: Okay. Great. Yeah. And then eight to fifteen percent is it's a it's a good response rate. The average that I usually care about in personalized approaches is eight to ten percent, so if you're already the double have seven that are upwards of, like, twenty five.

Host 1: But I would say, like, average is probably like, ten to twelve. I would say.

Client 2: That's great great. We have a similar customer like similar sized customer, now they've grown about one hundred and fifty employees now it's called a studio. But when they signed up with us, they were about forty and fifty members, similar.

Host 1: Ae studio, Yeah.

Client 2: A e studio, And yeah.

Host 1: I think my friend works at company say.

Client 2: Okay. So they are proud minded customer base saw response rates going up to more than fifty percent. They were at fifty one five percent. And with bio intelligence, we help them should around fifty percent or I think over fifty percent, we have their Cro J Fox on video. You know sharing is is use case there. Happy to share that with you after the call. But you know, we have twenty one minutes. So let me just quickly cover know, what we do at a very high level So We just quickly Do you find presentations boring or Kinda...

Client 2: So I I just need to talk about do slides then so that, you know, let's keep it more engaging. Just to give you a picture about, you know, what we do. So we basically help you laser focus these four areas. So talking about all stages on the funnel, starting from targeting to prioritizing who you know, you wanna reach out first? Then connecting it with insights and then closing them and we given insights there as well. So all four stages of the funnel are all three stages of the funnel and selecting being being one off the add ons that we added here. So in terms of targeting, what we we can do is you you already have great client looked up looked at those names, like planes like Uber of the world, so that's pretty impressive already. But If you're going after, let's say have thousand leads, hypothetically speaking in in in in. And what we can do, we can run an analysis on top of it using our product Apis. And we can tell you which are those you know, too any into twenty five percent types of personalities. That you don't have the potential to get in about seventy percent seventy five percent off your revenue. So just to know, paint a picture with that. I'll I'll show you how I do, when it comes to my outbound strategy. This is the data of you might paid users today. This is a real time report. We do it every six months. And according to the report, Ds personality type, closes about four hundred percent. It has about four x bigger closer rate for us. Because those... A lot of types are earlier adopters and and they're pretty you, straightforward. So if they're evaluating, they might be really serious about it So So I... In terms of my outbound strategy today, I only go after the d not personality types because Ds closes about four hundred percent Dc about three hundred and D i approximately about one thirty percent. Right And if you see other personalities, I close around forty three see your around eighteen and things like that. So it helps me you know, focus only on personalities which have a bigger potential or a higher probability of closure for me. So that's where the targeting part I'm talking about What you can do is I can show you something similar. So These are my inbound. So I have this personality dives right here. Okay. So once a Ds personality personality type comes into my system, I use up hubspot. Be a higher rating or you can call it a higher lead score that we can prioritize it and go after it faster give it basically higher priority. If I get three sign ups at the moment, one comes from a d c type one and i type and one or ds s type. I would go after to the Bs s first Just to prioritize just to be a picture So that's one side. That's more on the likes of targeting where I think you know, it will be really valuable for you. We have an need integration with Sales loft so all you gonna do is integrate it with the Mandate. It's a two minute process. Once you do that all the data or that is, you know, inside will be automatically enriched by commanding.

Host 1: And okay. So let me. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt well. Let me just get this straight really quick. So you guys plug into our Crm you run an analysis on our close customers to see what is the most common personality type. And you use that to basically estimate, like, much more likely certain personality types are so close than others And then, like how do you identify personality types for, like, new outbound people that we're reaching out to Sure.

Client 2: So we have Ba dashboard something similar to do...

Host 1: I guess, basically, is there a way for us to build a lead list Solely of the people that fit the personality type that are buying our products the most.

Client 2: Yes. There is. So this is gan. So this is the sales dashboard that we have Now. What you can do is you can upload the list here. Of up to five hundred people and you can do a bulk analysis one one analysis that you can do for one to one personalization is a chrome extension. Is similar to this. Okay? Go a person's profile. Or I'll I'll cover more on that, but not to confuse you, but this is one to one. If you want to do the bulk analysis, You can have this data right here. And Within this data, you'll also know different areas are earlier adopters know who are skeptics? What motivated is that you can go directly after earlier adopters. Or those personalities that really work for you are that really close to you. So that's number one. So number two, Before I move there, any questions on this part? Mh.

Host 1: No. Makes sense.

Client 2: Okay. Great. So number two, Be ver are too like we feel that, you know, sales is a little about tools. So I'm sure you would agree that today our day to day, we use more than twenty different tools due to our inbound outbound like, definitely more than twenty different tools if you include the emails calendars and everything. So don't want to make it complicated for a salesperson to adopt another tool So what we do is we bring mandate to wherever the salesperson is, So if you need to know the analysis on on a person profile, you don't need to go to that person's Linkedin all the time. You can have the analysis wherever you are. So may I ask you, what what are you guys using today? Gmail or Outlook?

Client 2: Email. Gmail. Great. So I use Gmail myself just to give you an example here, If I'm writing, do let's say This guy called on. All I all I gotta do is just put his name in the and click this button right here. Is on the Gmail. You can see this one here, Yep Now once you can click this button, you have the email writing insights.

Client 2: So you don't have to go to Linkedin. You can have the insights right here. Drop the email. And something more magical that's that we have built and I'll just show you a quick example of that. It's called one click personalization. So Let me just quickly take like a draft. Let's say this is an email. All I gotta do is just copy paste to template. Okay. And let's say writing it to Siobhan. Put in the subject For example, how to use Ai just hypothetical. Then click this one button. No it'll take about less than ten seconds. And personalize the email according to how She likes to read it. Wall. And less than ten seconds. So this is some sort of personalization that that we're bringing in to the table as well, which you know, we call it authentic personalization personalization, according to their personality, alongside lending how are you...

Host 1: But how are you understanding people personality. Like, not everyone takes this personality test so or you just assuming what the personality type is based on something and what is that something.

Client 2: Yeah. So hundred person percent based on data, no assumptions there. So just to give you an example, let's pull up Rabindranath. So Are you familiar with disc and function Okay. Those are the two most accurate methods of personality assessment test. And our is based on those two instruments plus Ai and neuroscience. Now depending upon all your data on Linkedin, Bd r, you know, data on your profile, to the likes comments, people you follow content you like content continue comment on there are about hundred and sixty different data points.

Host 1: Right. Yeah. So you're So you're like, assuming that I'm a certain personality type based on the information on my online profiles.

Client 2: Correct. Not assuming again. According to your digital touch point, the analysis is thrown based on that data.

Client 2: Yeah. Because I'll also share a quick you know, webinar with you we had last week you might be familiar with Cambridge analytic abuse. Right? So Cambridge analytic was the first person who predicted that that they evaluating or, you know, trying to play with people's allergies and behavior and trying to have the elections. The first person who called it out, in the world, His name is Mikhail Ko. Doctor Professor Mikhail Ko, he sits on our advisory board, science and advisory board, And he has... He's definitely one of the most popular researchers in the world with about seventeen thousand plus citations multiple books hundred plus research papers. Pretty famous a guy, also a Stanford professor So in that he discussed about the science behind personality ai. I'll also share that with you. If you're interested to learn a little bit deeper, just to see, you know, quote his words from that webinar even one single like has about eighty to eighty five percent accuracy. Of predicting a person's personality. But, v are taking, you know, taking into a hundred and sixty different data points. And not just one like But there's a good chunk of data that we are analyzing to be you're confident of that analysis. And and we publicly state ourselves that about eighty five percent accurate. So eight auto ten profiles, nine other ten profiles would be accurate. Yep. So So any questions so far before I know, I show you what sort of analysis we talking about.

Host 1: No. Let's keep up.

Client 2: Great. So let's say... Yeah. You know, one of your reps is doing one to one interaction. Let's say, hypothetically wanna reach out to Rabindranath. So they'll have a quick overview of Rabindranath functionality right here. But then just learning about personality, moon work. Right? They would need to have some actionable insights. that's what we do. We first tell you about your compatibility. We call it the zone of compatibility I'm a Cd type. He is an sd type. That means our personalities are not the same. So I should not follow my regular style, and I should switch it according Rabindranath. I should follow the insights. So while the insights are about how to craft an email, Rabindranath, tech should be formal to the point. Closing line should be formal again, you should be confident with the formal touch focused on output The length of the email should be shot, something like that. Now once I'm meeting Rabindranath. These are the do's and don'ts to keep in mind while engaging with with Rabindranath so that you can know speak to him, the way he likes to be spoken to. Then Similarly, like I said, at all stages of the funnel, so we'll call this as step to the top of the funnel, but you're trying to reach out or once you're making the call on on calling or once you're meeting the person a in a meeting like this, you can use insights on do's and don'ts. Then once the the person moves to next stage of the funnel, negotiations and closing happening You can use these insights And similarly to set up expectations, you can use these. And just like like, you yourself, you are familiar with what is this And what is ocean? There's a quick graph, which is mentioned right here about the person's test conversion profile. So This is like, a quick glimpse of of what it looks like. So any questions on on on this No.

Host 1: I think I understand how it works. I'm just curious to to see some actual results like, I know you said that this ae Studio company give a testimonial. I just texted my buddy if it works there. To get. But, like, what?

Client 2: I'm sorry. I was saying what's his name?

Client 2: Did you say Selwyn?

Host 1: First, it's e maybe.

Client 2: Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. So I asked him, but it... like, you know, like, in theory, what you're saying makes sense. Right? Like, if I can identify people whose personality types are most likely to buy my product to, like, use that to inform my prospecting strategy. Just wonder if it actually works. So I'm curious to either a, like, somehow just test it out. Or be, like get more, you know, case studies, custom testimonials that that kind of thing. That shows that data comparison before and after.

Client 2: And that's the alleged thing A lot of people I meet as this is a new technology, always say too to be true. But when they put it to test, that's where this either resolved. So we have customers like Paypal who's using it Mckinsey. We have a global roll with Mckinsey just a do old company. So Global rolled out with Mckinsey. They use they be insights with jumping on any sales call. That's part of their research for any mega deals that they closed. So I would share the, you know, case studies when you Like, what do you prefer? Though the windows or or the text I'll focus on that.

Host 1: You have both this Sure.

Client 2: So I'll share that. And I think the better way to do this would be to to see it for yourself. So I would I would basically ask yourself and your team four members that you mentioned. Let's set up a trial. And let's keep a target for it. Like you said, you want to make your top of the funnel better. And your current current response rates we'll talk about, like, we have six more minutes to go. Do you have a hot stop in six minutes?

Host 1: I do.

Client 2: Yeah Okay. So we can schedule you some more time to discuss about you know, a quick pilot kickoff where we can set up your whole team with a pilot twenty one day. And we can talk about what are your current results that you're getting precise results? And then we'll set it up. On those grounds. We'll do an ab b test one person can do the regular thing and one person can follow the insights into it. Begin you know, compare the results. Then we can do a pilot like that so that you see the value yourself because seeing is believing. Right? So we we won't talk about theory. We'll talk about, you know, something which is put into action. If you can, you know, as just to respect the time, if you can suggest me a good time, to meet... Let's say, Monday, Tuesday, I can get in my founder as well or or my head of initiative and we can kick off a trial.

Host 1: Yeah. Why don't you just go ahead and send me the touch I would like to talk to my friend and take a look at them before we schedule a time to set the trial. But as soon as I have that information, I can reach back to with sometimes for probably middle or late next week to get gale.

Client 2: Sure. That sounds great.

Client 2: And may know like how many customers do you guys have in total?

Client 2: Right now we're are about hundred hundred fifty customers in total, And they're all sizes starting from single users, do multinational customizations and everything in between.

Host 1: You said you're doing a global rollout with Mckinsey meaning all of i Mckinsey is going to be using the tool.

Client 2: Yeah. So June onwards, we started the global rollout. Have to check with my founder that where it is at this stage, but we started the global of the rollout out in June. So it's gotta be already, you know, a lot of different branches might be using it because it's December already Is.

Client 2: Yeah. We started with Paypal Paypal was one of our early customers. So we started with Paypal Brazil. And now I think Paypal is also using us in in five or six nations. I'll check on the exact data. But it's definitely in nation as well now, but they started with brazil Okay.

Host 1: Got it. Alright. Yeah. So if you could just shoot over that information I'll talk to my friend I'll take a look at it. And I can get back to you with sometimes for probably Yeah. Late next week.

Client 2: Sure. And and before we, you know, disconnect from from the call, just wanted to ask you, like, how actively are you looking to solve this problem? And and what's the evaluation process? Look like, for something like this, I mean, look, like any uptick in sales productivity and efficiency is compelling and something that I would have argentina in to to put in.

Host 1: I obviously, would need to know a little bit about pricing and know exactly, you know, whether or not it works. So the next step is just getting some feedback, looking at some data testing the product, and figuring out pricing. And if there's Roi based on what I anticipate to be the lift and, you know, reply and conversion to be because of this then we could justify find investing thing in it. Right.

Client 2: So evaluation like this, like, from the likes of flow or or Josh, Are they involved in in these guys evaluations or or yourself, you're you you're gonna be rolling it down?

Host 1: Just me.

Client 2: Okay. Understood. Great. So so yes, I'll send the testimonials the information from my side and then we'll get forward from there.

Host 1: Good. Sounds good. I appreciate your time. We'll talk you like Yep.

Client 2: Thanks so much for your time, donna. Have a good one. Okay Bye
