Client 1: I feel like we might need a different length.

Client 1: Why is that. Meeting recorder. Is this the same will happen last time?

Client 2: No, I think that's our new sales bot. Caught sales AI. That you can just kick it out whoever the host is.

Client 1: I don't even know if. Maybe Beth.

Client 2: Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't matter. It doesn't do anything. It just records it into the cloud. Kind of, like, gone.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 2: All right, now we're gonna start out with my favorite question of the week. This week's question is gonna be, what are we getting for Black Friday? Cyber, Monday. Who wants to go first. Lee, I think you have an answer.

Client 3: No, it's just that Black Freddie started last Friday now because no one wants it to be like it's. It's already Black Friday. And it's not even Thanksgiving.

Client 2: Why not the actual Black Friday or Cyber Monday? You get anything.

Client 3: No I. Never partake because that's like my limited special family time. But if I was gonna get, like, a major appliance, that would be a new washer dryer. That's how exciting my life is.

Client 2: Nice you got to have clean clothes.

Client 3: Overdue Carly, because you just got a new apartment.

Client 2: Carly, what are you getting.

Client 4: That's it.

Client 2: Sorry I cut out one more time could you say it one more time.

Client 4: I'm hoping to get some new bedding.

Client 2: Oh, bedding. Okay. Hopefully you're going with Carrie. Carrie Lohas. So you can support Bolt.

Client 4: No, I'm not.

Client 4: I like my parachute sheets. I just got a different size bed. So I'm just getting the same ones.

Client 2: Nice.

Client 2: Now who wants to go.

Client 1: I can go. I'm gonna get my fiancee? Those del Toro lit, quidity shoes. That drop.

Client 2: The what. A.

Client 1: Del Dora Del Toro is a shoe brand. And they have, like, great loafers and stuff like that. And they had a drop. With liquidity the Meme account. And they're sick.

Client 1: They're called the fed.

Client 2: What the fed. I've never heard of this.

Client 1: All right? I'm gonna look at. You got it.

Client 2: All right. I'm gonna look all right, Ben. What you got? You got loafers? Is that on your list.

Client 5: No, I'm speaking of liquidity. They also sell a FDX risk Management shirt that I was thinking about buying. But. No, I usually. Don't have anything that I want to buy and then go online and go, oh, this is yeah, no, this. And that's how I'm planning on doing Black Friday, Cyber Monday, again. Just sort of seeing what's out there and if I can afford it.

Client 2: I think what you should do, Ben, is you should just go to a website, maybe choose like Walmart. Go to the Black Friday ads, close your eye and just scroll up the page and whatever it stops and your most lands on buy it.

Client 5: I used to use darts but replace my computer got way too expensive so.

Client 2: Yeah, I feel that I feel that. All right. I don't got anything on my list. So we're in the same boat. I feel like once you start to get older, you just don't get anything because you don't need anything. But maybe that's just me.

Client 4: Well also, most of the sales started like last week seven buying stuff from my apartment. 30. 5% offense. I mean, what are they gonna start doing a year round though?

Client 2: Like it'll be Black, November.

Client 1: I'm waiting to see if the coffee table I want goes on sale.

Client 2: See, there you go. These Del Toro Suede Milano is with the green accent.

Client 1: Is that the one? Yeah.

Client 2: Dang, look at those.

Client 2: I don't know make some special but they look great.

Client 2: All right, what? What do we want to chat about today? Who wants to start out the list? Looks like Carly's going first.

Client 2: Yeah. Mike's late to the game. Here we go. Let's wait for him. Merry, you're late to the game, but you can still have an opportunity to win. The question of the day is, what are you shopping for? Black Friday, cyber Monday.

Client 6: What? What am I like a product?

Client 2: Yeah. What are you buying.

Client 6: A. Probably a winter coat for my daughter.

Client 2: See, there we go. Useful purchase. I guess you can stay. At this joking. Go ahead, Carly.

Client 4: Yeah. So I. Spoke with Kristen earlier today. You know, she asked me follow up on Monday. She's still finishing up. The story she said she was working on she's going to be done today. Then she's gonna. Call recording again. Don't actually send me a story idea that he had on the call, so I share that with her. So she's close to the recording. And read the idea and get back to me probably tomorrow.

Client 2: Nice. Well, that's great news. Do we think it'll be a story? Do you think it'd be the inclusion? What do we think it'll be.

Client 4: Impossible to say. At this point, but hopefully we should know before Thanksgiving.

Client 2: Nice. All right. Well, that's pretty good news. Glad to hear that. It looks like you got another one. Fintech, NEX, Nexus.

Client 3: Merry.

Client 6: Over to you. Yeah, that was. Someone that we had connected to in Web summit. And then, you know, she got kind of hammered last week with all the NFX stuff. So but she wants to do a video interview with dawn next week. She's available any day after 12:00 p.m. I think is the time. So just to figure that out. She is in Europe, so I'm trying to figure if she was giving me 12:00 p.m. Eastern or European times. We'll have to figure out what where Don is done in San Francisco next week.

Client 2: I don't know. It's a good question next week. Yes, probably. But he's out in New York, all of December.

Client 6: So all of this.

Client 2: Most of it.

Client 3: Well, that's good to know.

Client 2: Yeah, I don't know exactly. Well, he's not in New York. He's in Boston, but still.

Client 6: Wait. You see there. Then when we're gonna be in San Francisco.

Client 2: No. I think he flies out the week after, but we were all planning it down, so I just I don't remember exactly when he leaves, but it's most of December. So.

Client 6: Let me just check with her because she's saying I would be available any day from. 12:00 P.m.. But she doesn't say Easter.

Client 3: No, she she means Europe because they're 5 hours ahead. So. She's saying.

Client 6: Twelve. She's not saying anything. She's not saying anything. She's saying twelve to P. M. And she has no idea that I'm probably she might not know. I'm not you. I'm us because I met her in Europe.

Client 3: I'm guessing she knows.

Client 6: Well, no. Because that would be, you know, 12:00 p.m. Her time. It's gonna be 07:00 A.m. Or 04:00 A.m. For Dawn.

Client 2: I don't know.

Client 3: But most importantly, she is great. Merry. That is a win. Carlene. Merry her on a roll. They're on fire.

Client 3: Fire emoji's up. So I guess my goal. The question is right. You're gonna check that?

Client 6: I'm just gonna check. I mean, we could do we could say 07:00 p.m.. Her time, right? Which would be, you know, 11:00 a.m.. Don't.

Client 3: Well, that's kind of late for a reporter, so it could be doesn't Don started like 08:00 a.m.

Client 2: Yeah, Pacific just depends on the day, but Yeah. So we'll just figure out whatever time and then we'll make it happen.

Client 6: Yep, great.

Client 2: The Forbes Contributor. I know all of that. So that's fine.

Client 3: Did you see Dennis's thing?

Client 2: Yeah. I think it's gonna. Ruffle some feathers, so we're gonna try to tone it down a little bit.

Client 3: Meaning with VCs.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: So we're gonna. Ask him not and he said. Right. That the he's.

Client 2: Okay. So we'll get feedback, and then we'll send it back to you guys.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. Pending pitches. Yep. So I got linked the dock. There. Is there anything you guys need for those.

Client 3: Which ones.

Client 2: The Battle for yield.

Client 3: No, the pitch is great. We're waiting. I mean, my goal not to put you on the spot, right? Because I also emailed an American banker reporter. Did your friend email you back.

Client 6: Not yet. I need to follow up with him.

Client 6: Then it's fine because they're probably, you know. Whoever. I don't think it matters. They were both pitching. Someone.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, it is a really good one for them because they are banking focused. So we're hopeful. I think honestly, just to the Black Friday point, a lot of reporters already have left. I don't know why they would take a week off or Thanksgiving. Okay. And then we did ask Techrunch for the paid rates. Not that you're definitely going to do that. Also, once we see your edits to the Forbes column. We will Swizzle it so it doesn't look the same for Venture Beat because they definitely are interested in a piece from Dawn. But just because of the Matte thing, it can't run until after Forbes.

Client 3: All right.

Client 3: Yep. See us we can pick up closer to unless you have any updates.

Client 2: No, that's fine. But I do have one thing. So the Arcadvance plus. When do we think that the best next timing for that is since we weren't able to get it out this week. Or last week. Do we think like first week of December 2? Week of December.

Client 3: When you say Arcadvance plus.

Client 2: Can you that's the Venture Beat or Venture Deck competitor, where it has a six month interest only period. Similar to arcadvance. But it has longer term than it has I. O. Period, but it's still revenue based financing. There. We wrote a Press release on it.

Client 3: Yep.

Client 6: Do you have I mean, I.

Client 6: Do you have to get it out by a certain day, or do you want to get it out around something.

Client 6: I would shoot maybe the middle of next week. Maybe like end of the end of December. Beginning. Of December.

Client 2: We were trying to aim for the fifth through the 9th somewhere in that way.

Client 6: So the following the week after Thanksgiving.

Client 6: After cyber the week after several week right.

Client 2: So maybe you could just get back to timing on that.

Client 3: Yeah. Can we say right now what we think never on a Monday, but it is gonna be so to your benefit to do the week of the fifth, not the week before, because Cyber Monday, Black Friday. That that retail coverage will dominate. So the week of the fifth is perfect. And we can chop it. When we're back. But either like Carly, the six, or the 7th, right. Tuesday or Wednesday.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 3: That's good. It's not Monday. It just isn't a good day.

Client 2: Okay, why get this finalized then? And we can aim for the 637. Okay. Awards and Lists who wants to walk through these.

Client 5: Yes, I was sorry. I just reading over. Yeah, I'll walk us through these lease. Sorry.

Client 3: Were you going to jump in? No, go right ahead.

Client 5: Okay. So the list. Like we had discussed last week. Differ from the ones that you would send Austin, Obviously, I just wanted to give you a sense of the people we pitched. Also, notice that Jim Broyers, Top 33 Digital Lenders Arc is already on that list, and I am pitching him to see if he can expand on that and maybe put you guys underneath in sort of a larger. More elaborated. Context. Now in terms of the awards. Still, a lot of the deadlines are to be announcing. They see Disruptor 50 TVA and forged from Tech 50. I reached out to someone at Forbes to try and get a more specific date. Haven't yet gotten a more specific date, however, based on last deadline, it will be sometime in early March. And then Fintech Nexus Industry Awards. They're free. They're due on December 2. We have discussed we sort of gone in and out of these awards a few times. I was planning on putting together. A template depending if we wanted to go with this one. Because they have both award like recommendation award for either innovation digital banking or emerging fintech innovators. So not sure which one you guys want to go with. There are other ones as well. I can send you the full list. Austin.

Client 2: And the merchant merging. Fintech.

Client 5: Let's do that. All right. Sounds good. And yeah. And like we mentioned last week, just whenever you could shoot over the Arc credit card. Not that it's necessary for the upcoming Free Award, but just so that we have it on hand.

Client 2: 1 second. I'm just going to drop it in a chat, but don't tell ID I did that.

Client 5: Sounds good. Thank you.

Client 2: Cool. All right, Sharika, what you want to take.

Client 1: Honestly, everyone took everything.

Client 1: So. I was Ben with the award, so let him take the lead because he's on top of everything there. So all good.

Client 2: Nice. Maybe you want to talk to me about the podcasts.

Client 1: Oh, the podcast. So I know. Ben was also pitching some I haven't gotten anything on my end yet, so we just keep on reaching out there. But I don't know if you have an update. Just pitching dawn as a thought later in the area.

Client 5: Yeah, I continue to to follow up and annoy everyone who runs the airwaves to try and get dawn on there. The one person that responded recently offered a $4000 package. And we had discussed this two weeks ago or so. So I figure we're going to kind of avoid those types of things. However, we're just going to continue to pitch. Unfortunately, I had pissed a Stanford podcast. Thinking that you know him being an MBA might be good, however, they only do people who are still at Stanford. So that's unfortunate. But you know, gaining some traction, people are responding, which lets me know the emails work. So.

Client 5: Nice.

Client 2: Just keep pitching.

Client 4: I know we have some content coming through and a few stories pipelines so those will all just enrich these pitches so we'll keep you posted. But we're on top of it.

Client 2: Nice, cool. Well, we have 15 minutes left. What else would you guys like to decide or discuss.

Client 3: Few questions about podcast.

Client 2: Sure.

Client 3: So tell me your relationship with Jason Lumpkin.

Client 2: Like, I know we don't really have a relationship. There's more relationship. With Cap, Jason, Jason Len Can, then US and Jason lynnkin.

Client 3: Okay. Because I feel like Sara. Like you said, they are getting so big and. It's a no brainer for them. And we were like Jericho Markov, who was a thinner times for a million years in one of Pulitzer and now went to Stanford. He like, took a buyout. He's a very good friend of Jason's. So what if, like, we had dawn with like, a veteran tech reporter who is no longer on staff. And Jason, like, you don't care. Right what format. Because I feel like we've talked about this internally. And you've mentioned it a few times, like, Jericho should be on these podcasts, like, I don't I don't get what the issue is. So I think we just have to pair him with someone. And then the other question is. Any startups that you guys have funded that are like friendly that we could pair him with.

Client 2: Oh, there's all kinds of startups that we can put in there. I think the bigger thing would be to get the podcast and let me get the startups. But yeah, there's a whole list of people that would do it.

Client 3: Yeah. And really, it's so eager to deliver. But like, when you pitch it, you pitch what you're gonna offer. So is there like, one that comes to mind, especially one with a female founder.

Client 2: Female founder. I don't know about female founder but I was gonna say. Swayable or Gigwell. Those are pretty good.

Client 3: Okay. So like.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 3: There's one other podcast I forgot to add to this. Do you know Jason Cub, Canada?

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Do you know him?

Client 2: Yeah. We turned down his podcast. He wanted us to sponsor it. It was like 25 Grand.

Client 3: Okay, so don't go to him, right.

Client 2: Well, that was the sponsorships team. So that's gonna be different than the Earn team.

Client 4: What'd you say? I thought of him now anyway.

Client 2: Yeah, I would. But yeah, it was just a sponsorship team.

Client 3: Not as excellent.

Client 2: Well, it is with Jason because it's his podcast. It's just he has a team that goes out and try to get sponsorships for it. And those are the people we declined.

Client 3: No, but that's important. So Jason didn't reach out his sponsorship guide in or whatever. So we'll go to JSON. We know him. And the other thing.

Client 4: I think you're gonna hate this idea.

Client 2: What's? That.

Client 2: Supervisor.

Client 4: No, he's friends with Elon.

Client 2: Oh, nice.

Client 4: I'm pretty sure he's advisor to the board as well, so I've been reading a lot about it. On Twitter. Also so I don't know if right now is the moment, but if you normally. Maybe for a future.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, I just feel like between. Rvs and all sigh in your end and treasury and the battlefield like there's those are so Jason, he might not do it right away, but I was simply asking if you've been in touch with him so. We'll just approach him and then the last thing and I'll try to be super quick. I think you'll hate this idea, but it is weird. Look, I feel like the category isn't getting the visibility. It should like there's so many founders on TechCrunch and Venture Bead. And yet you guys are the. Enablers of these startups. So you know the guy that does a podcast every day. So not kept Chase, but the other competitors that Techrunch featured.

Client 2: How about Nathan Ladka from Founder, path.

Client 3: Yeah. So would dawn ever house him on his or would he have gone on his.

Client 2: Like. Don thinks this guy's a joke.

Client 2: He definitely would not let him on our podcast. We might go on his but definitely not the other way around.

Client 3: Okay. And then is there any value in us getting you. Like. A guest. We like the women getting funded angle is just getting so much traction.

Client 2: So if. All those, all those people, any founders.

Client 3: If we got you a woman founder from one of our other clients, Small, right?

Client 3: Like, Don have her on.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: To talk about how important. Alt, finances.

Client 2: Well, that's not what the podcast is about. The podcast is interviewing startup founders about their journey of growing their startups.

Client 2: So it definitely wouldn't. It definitely would not be with the angle of alternative finance. But if they want to share their story, that's a totally different thing.

Client 3: Okay. All right. I'm just thinking, like, there might be some cool clients that have their own following, and it could just be a little pop?

Client 2: Yeah, yeah, but. I would tell them and that it's a platform for them to share their story, not for them to try to, like, pump up arc.

Client 2: You know what I mean?

Client 2: Right? It's much different to try to say, hey, talk about alternative financing that you don't need use or no or need versus, like, share your story, which comes across as much more natural.

Client 3: Yep. Okay. All right, back to you guys.

Client 2: Well, then I got a question. Is there anything else we should be doing. Now that we're down to the last. 60 Days of the year. Besides, the year in review. Think about it. I don't even answer today, but just think about it. Is there something on your wish list you want to do? Is there something or do you want to apply for? Is there some list you want us to do? Is there an event you think we should go after. Shoot for the stars, and then we'll try to rein it in from there, but just think about what are the things you think we should be doing from PR and Comms perspective, or even outside of that that we should be doing over the next. 600 days.

Client 3: Well, were you we're gonna talk to someone in underwriting if there were, like, three verticals that we could include as like. On the Arc platform. These three are getting traction. Right? Like. Ad tech, Agtac, mentech, whatever it is.

Client 2: Yep. Yeah.

Client 3: I think probably starting next week because of. We're closed. Wednesday Afternoon. So unless it's close tomorrow, tomorrow. Or any time the following week. Oh, Carly, when are you out? You should be on the.

Client 4: 28th, 30th.

Client 2: Okay. Next Monday, the Next Wednesday. All right. I'll get some dates and times together. You want 45 minutes or 30 minutes? Enough.

Client 3: I think it's good to set them for 45 in case it's really good, we can always end early.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 3: Cool. This is like one of your underwriting people who's like, looking at deals every day.

Client 2: Right. Well, this is our chief credit officer, which came from Brex. That's Enrique, but I can get you somebody from underwriting to I just figure Enrique will have the most. Sense since he looks at all of you really senior person, just someone who could speak to like how they what they're seeing, like the trend and especially the verticals.

Client 2: Yep. Okay.

Client 3: All right.

Client 2: Anything else.

Client 4: I think we're good.

Client 2: Cool. Well, if I don't talk to you before the end of the week, I hope you guys have a happy Thanksgiving and have fun shopping on Black Week. Black Friday Week. I don't know. I don't even know what you call it anymore. Cyber Monday Week, the whole month.

Client 4: The whole month.

Client 2: Have fun shopping in the month of November.

Client 6: There you go. Happy Thanksgiving.
