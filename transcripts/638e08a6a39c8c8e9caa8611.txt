Client 3: So that was that was a highlight of the week end and a new tool late night outing for me these days. Suffered on saturday, but was good fun. Alright. Alright. Well, Let's dive in into what is. I just realized this is a one... Yeah. This is our pen pronounce. Team meeting of the year. We have only one more, the week of Christmas the first one after duke gets back. So it's crazy. I'm really seeing the year end not even approaching accelerating far to far too fast. How how people done with their anyone doing Christmas shopping? Are you guys pretty much done? Not done?

Client 3: Alrighty. So let's dive in because there's someone now exciting announcements happening. If you haven't seen it already. K, December fifth, no. Packs other than Yeah. This is the next last team meeting and some of us will be scrum for Christmas gifts Alright.

Client 3: Dive again. Alright. What are we doing here at Orbit? We believe that putting the right people together enhances human potential and we do that through enabling pure connections in all types of of communities. And how do we do that? Values are that we're pathfinder, bold and fearless, and we carved talks where there's none. I still get amazed when I speak to prospects and some of them how long it really takes them to understand what we actually do. It's always a nice reminder just how innovative... What do we do is and how much more there is to do to convince the world. We have a champion mindset, everyone over here around the screen is relentless of pursuing greatness. Proactively attacks ambitious goals. I know. We're all feeling the ambitious goal now getting close to your end with all our major goals and to do lists that world all. Working very hard to complete. And throughout all this we do it with care. We care about each other we care about our. Clients we care about doing everything with integrity and a human first approach and today, rather than diving into straight into Bd numbers there's a very natural transition to our values. I'm not sure it who's the announcement on Slack just a few minutes before the team announcement, but I hope you will all join me. In congratulating Galadriel Pico to her promotion as orbit cheap operating officer there which because I'm sure, your old rate comes in very, very well deserved just about a year of her joining the company where she's had a tremendously positive impact. Literally from day one, You can I have been thinking about this promotion for few months now, so it's pretty much in line with the annual reviews that we typically do, but we wanted to have the conversation with her study, festive season is extra. But yeah, it's been a very eventful year, and you can have one of the main takeaways as three, the type of people the type of leaders that we want to be building this company with and M and is a true representation of all of orbit values. It's just being personally, my left hand where those don't don't know. I'm left handed and and in this right hand and she has impressed. I know the team was especially the people that really work closest with her. Our investors our clients and we see her being a tremendous asset into the future of the company. And I'm just throwing back a few words over here you said yourself after her first quarter of the company, if you remember Galadriel was voted, shooting star and she has continued to literally shoot the lives out quarter over quarter So a very well deserved promotion. Welcome to the team Galadriel, and I'm very, very excited to share with the team. This is This is a huge step forward for the company.

Client 6: You're here.

Client 4: Thank you.

Client 4: Thank you so much. I'm I'm really excited and I'm thrilled to be specifically taking on this challenge.

The timing of it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Client 3: Penelope, Merry, do you wanna chime in? I know you're are the people that work closest with Galadriel on a regular basis, and I know how much you appreciate working with her.

Client 8: Yeah. I'm happy to jump in here. Yeah. I mean, all these bullet points, I mean, just from working with Galadriel in the six months that I have. I can definitely attest too. You know, she's definitely really has helped out me onboarding and really just really re and her, you know, I'm doing it all role and always has a lot to contribute to you know, Michaels personally, So k you out really happy to see that you are thriving and you are being rewarded for it.

Client 4: Thank you, Merry.

Client 3: Oh, Nice is, Merry. Thank you.

Client 2: I'll I'll throw in something on the engineering side in that like, despite the fact that Galadriel has largely been focused on the Bd side, like, there's been times when we've had client facing issues that she's just jumped in had gotten to know the problem gotten stuck in with the rest of the engineering team. So definitely, definitely an example of be willing to do it all.

Client 4: Thanks, Jebediah.

Client 6: She kind of reminds me of, like, that overpowered Mpc that pops up every now and again, like you always see them in in the background, but then they eventually like you you run into work on some some immediate problem and then you find out that this, like op nbc is like already in the middle taking care of it and you're like, Cool. I guess I'll go over there.

Client 6: Yes handled.

Client 3: I know. She's definitely a handler. Slash fixer And Penelope, I'll just shout out when when we... When we first met for coffee and Sofia. I remember it was very high up on Patti agenda. When we send out one to one to praise the Galadriel's hiring. I just remember face specifically like Galadriel. Water higher water higher.

Client 9: What. Actually actually, I remember, I remember basically, like, after for my first one one with Galadriel, I I think I messaged you personally on Slack. Oh my god this is your best higher so far. So although I was just less than a six month, and I remember the I I clicked soup quickly over all of the common topics that we discuss about Star an accelerator and everything. And... Yeah. I just want to say thank very much for guiding me towards my promotion and for the all the hard times experienced.

Client 4: Yeah. Of course. Oh is she freeze.

Client 7: She's be having Internet issues Day. So not it because she moved recently.

Client 7: So, yeah. I don't know.

Client 3: Think she froze.

Client 4: Alright.

Client 3: Thanks. Ana Yeah. I think credit was freezing. But I'm excited, you're so excited. I knew this is gonna be widely appreciated from everyone and it's always nice to kick off the festive month with more good news internally Galadriel congrats super super well deserved thank you for accepting the role and I self self stoked.

Client 4: Thank you. I'm really stoked. I'm so stoked. Thank you for I feel so loved right now. Thank you everybody.

Client 3: Oh, and yeah. Galadriel will be celebrating with a little trip to Miami, will be working shoulder to shoulder on twenty twenty three strategy. So we'll share also a picture with a cocktail in hunt soon, flying out tomorrow.

Client 4: Yep. And then and and then in the new Year, we'll share our goals for twenty twenty three.

Client 3: Yeah. Very excited about seeing tomorrow. Kinda wait.

Client 4: Me too.

Client 3: Alright. Onto the topic of people doing really really well next up is Lee, who has gotten closer for the first time to all us several seventy clients and now closer to the seven hundred k arr that's that we've ever seen before, Absolutely yeah. Jebediah amazing. That is the reaction. We you've been absolutely crushing it. I'm I'm just learning so much from me. Just on Friday. He did a demo again, which Thankfully, his meeting recorder was in there because I'm printing it today hail lighting it and we'll be following it word forward. I mean, you everything that... I mean, you're selling orbit I wanna to buy it. I wanna put all my savings into pot orbit. This much disposable connect all my audiences. I know wonder your crush and just use these approach and is phenomenal. The words you choose, the intonation, the way you try sales with so much urgency and bigger and you win the trust of clients. It's been a really really impressive to see. So thank you for our rounding up four percent month of a month growth during very, very tough circumstances out there with frozen budgets and all sorts of headwind you're absolutely would be crushing in.

Host 1: Yeah. Thanks. Hopefully, hopefully, the the growth and the ramp up and the pacing continues.

Client 3: Hopefully. I know that will we'll cross all these... The the magic seven. That's the goal cross or for your end both in terms of number of ones and and Arr. So... yeah, kept kept the update high level all going in the right direction and now it coincided with our monthly investor update, we did get a few responses. Yeah. Solid performance, especially when All all investors are saying, portfolio companies are left right and center With, as I said, frozen budgets, still very much in the tech space. The team is layoffs shrinking, shrinking tools, really focusing on core initiatives rather than anything new. So every single deal and those current circumstances it's a it's a major success. So not only was data load. We managed to grow and thank you to Cs for the hard work on renewal. Of course, that error number is made up with defending existing revenue and adding new one, which is why renewal are also so so important. If he's adding deals every day, but we're bleeding cash and losing customers, then will continue staying neutral, but with actually defending and adding, we can continue to be positive on a month of a month basis. So thank you everyone across the board and helping defend clients. Alright. On that now. A little bit more from cs details.

Client 9: So sorry, guys, I I had to switch of my my video because my Internet is struggling a lot. So I will be very quick here in terms of renewal, Yeah, Not sure not much have changed. We are still waiting on eighty three fifth five hundred almost, we are waiting for two clients for October. And then for November, we also have two clients, and then most of them are in December. We are chasing them. So really hope that we'll be able to save at least eighty percent of those accounts. In terms of engagements, very, very good job on the Cs side, I would say because a lot of clients have said that December is a bit slow mom. And due to the whole there might not run engagement, but Nevertheless we are seeing that our we are currently be on the target. So I'm very happy that our discussion topic glad all the recommendations come clients are actually taking them. And we are seeing a bee here as well. Bill next flight, unless you have any questions. So the Cs team focus for this week can, like, next week, it's basically renewal. Analysis. So finally, I was able to get my hands on that. Since Thursday last week, I really want to present an aim to present something during our last weekly kick of meeting basically, I'm I'm going to be on Monthly. So I was supposed to go on Monthly from December the nineteenth, but then I decided to just stay up until the holidays because I really want to work a little bit more users so I will be with the whole team until the holidays. And yeah, I really really agree...

Client 3: That's new to me, that's amazing. Thank you for staying to round up the year. That's really kind of you.

Client 9: And yeah.

Client 3: I sure I.

Client 9: Yeah. That with Galadriel on Friday and, yeah, I really want to to help with just possible. We have some some work to do before the holidays. So... Yeah, I think more better always.

Client 3: Thank you. I'll be appreciate.

Client 3: Alright excited about that.

Client 9: Sure. I'll be working on data analysis, community Nor, And then the cs customer house scores Galadriel I created this customer health board So I'm going to assign scores to customer so it's easy for us to basically see who is alive, like, very likely to renew and hung not q and who we really need to jump on calls next next quarter. So, yeah, these are all the debates I'm I'm having catch with catch with Galadriel every week. So in case any priorities change are happy to take on take over some more responsibilities.

Client 4: Penelope put together a great transition document that we went over on Friday just to prepare and leading it out to her leave and one thing that we talked about is she's gonna be creating community nor matching rounds for us. In draft mode. To that while she's gone we he keep them going. But it'll be easier even easier to just keep them keep them going and have the already set up in the platform.

Client 3: Amazing. I love that. Great idea. Thank you. That's gonna be so helpful it was glitch at the back of my mind. Are we gonna be able to keep them keep them up as regularly as you've being running them Penelope so that's gonna be emergency helpful. Thank you.

Client 4: Thank you adding. Thank you for reoccurring matches.

Client 8: Thank you.

Client 9: Yeah. Exactly. Think you guys.

Client 3: Perfect.

Client 8: I I I had a slide in there as well. I I I think it may have guidance get, but I do have an onboarding slide in there. Where it one.

Client 3: Trying to zoom out then my computer is also a bit slow. Do you wanna... Do you wanna open if... Do you wanna double check from your end and see if it ended up in Oh, yeah.

Client 3: I think you got wait. Yeah. Now it's showing up on new zoom model. So let's see. Maybe it was hidden or something. Okay.

Client 8: Yeah. So definitely wanted to make sure I was able to cover this slide because there are a lot of clients and onboarding right now. So just big highlights to touch on right now. I know there was a big effort with p check dot com. Engineering team getting us some answers there. So really appreciate all the work went into them. I have the feedback call scheduled with them tomorrow. So I'll let you know what they what they say about that, they were one of the clients who was asking to disable to disable the scheduling functionality, and they had some other questions. Really just regarding on the user side of things. So excited to add more details there after I talk to bart tech tomorrow. Another bigger update, Octopus venture is still on our radar. But they're doing or not on our radar arm. Sorry. We're still onboarding them, but they're doing some more preliminary tracks before we can kick off onboarding. I heard from Ida today. She says she's regroup with the team, and we'll hopefully have an update for us soon on what we get our first onboarding scheduled session scheduled. Other folks to talk about one that I did wanna flag is, I do have a feedback call with Radical B today their first engagement. I think wasn't it as strong as they would needed to be? Just really starting off but they only have four point three percent offense. And then their match rating was a four out of five and the sixty seven S score. So gonna get creative today on the feedback call and try to you know, highlight some some of the better testimonials that we received, but just wanna a flag back before going into the call.

Client 3: And what's the with the radical, we see they have an opt out?

Client 8: Yes. They have an opt out. Yeah. It's it's this week.

Client 3: Right. Well let's see if we've managed to personalize persuade them to give it a try again in January.

Client 8: Yeah. I I I think that's the the best way to go, and I think we can you know, revert to kinda just like a time of year. Also wanna get their thoughts on things before you know, mentioning, that I think the numbers could have been stronger. So wanna get their thoughts and then try to persuade them to run another one.

Client 3: Cool. By the way Way i think the revenue and food check octopus might be swapped or something along those lines.

Client 8: Yes. I think they absolutely are. I noticed that as well. Yeah. Octopus is ten can check it is five Cool.

Client 3: Mh.

Client 8: Then just going through quickly evolve, we and I are hopping on the feedback call with them tomorrow. So just an update here that they sent that sixty eight invites and they invited up to ten k members. So My lease approach is trying to get them to enter into a longer agreement. So they can really evaluate the product further. And run a combination of group and one on one matching around so see which product would fit their immunity more. And last one that touch on here for engineering is that round has a matching around running, and so they'll need two edit matches on twelve eight.

Client 8: Other than other than that, just wanted to keep it high level. Sorry for jumping in here of engineering. But if Aaron everyone has any questions on any any slides, please let me know.

Client 7: Now I'm good Thanks Merry.

Client 3: Yeah. And for a little bit of flavor on Christina Lo coaching, which closed. This is our first spiritual awakening community. So we shall be helping people on their journey to discovering and and evolving spiritually, which is very exciting. It's a new use case for us. From well being and self care. So we should see some interesting topics there. I think we should run an internal matching around on the topic you you ask me.

Client 2: Yeah Cool.

Client 3: Thanks, Merry.

Client 3: You're welcome alright. Product and engineering Alright.

Client 2: So for the numbers this, Auto was actually the one who ran them has some good insights on them. So take it away.

Client 7: Not not too much insights. But yeah, we almost hit November targets in terms of active users and repeat users, which is great. Like, we're missing what the hundred of updates for this. There's a slight dip an N s for now. I don't know if it's not related to any all the changes we're doing, but hopefully not. And match rating remains the same, which is great for for now. Not much to say, honestly, we crossed it last month and we in October, so I think over overall very strong quarter for now.

Client 2: Yeah. And we we kind of expected the dip in December Yep.

Client 3: In November, I mean, in the states, it's a it's a three week month with thanksgiving. So the fact that it's only a hundred below target, that's still amazing.

Client 3: I was already adjusted. Was it already adjusted for thanksgiving this slightly lower projection for November or no?

Client 7: It wasn't... I don't think it was adjusted, but it was expected then I think December is going fairly strong considering where five is days in. So.

Client 3: Awesome. Thank you very much for reporting and you do ask the index absence.

Client 3: Two double days coming up well way.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. So no. We have three demo days coming... We have three demos coming up on Wednesday, And then another two coming in on Thursday next week. So the three this Wednesday just to remind people Simone will be showing off the customer csv upload, so being able to add members to an audience with custom data fields. Ian gonna be showing off the integrations with Salesforce and Hubspot. And I'll be showing off of the workspace data dashboard. All three of these are basically on track. We expect to be able to have them for Wednesday. I don't have a whole lot else to show you because all of us have been just focusing one hundred percent on these demos.

Client 3: Amazing. So good to hear that everything is still on track. Very very excited. We'll be ready with popcorn and ready to cheer on, all your hard work. I'm sure it's coming. It's gonna come together.

Client 2: Yeah. I'm personally really interested in seeing what ian end does with Salesforce hubspot. To.

Client 3: I mean, all these...

Client 10: It's just just hubspot. There. Salesforce Okay.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 10: Well, I apologize. Don't how about going there? Or maybe it has been remove it at a later date.

Client 3: Well, that would still be a great chaser for our Hubspot prospect. So the the buyer un spot. So that's amazing. Definitely gonna help push some deals along make some sustained very happy. And then Anna, Jacob, how are we feeling for the mid December demos?

Client 6: I have a quick update before that. The engagements scheduling the new stuff. Thank you Merry and Galadriel for the Pass last week I've gone through that and I I just need to hear back on a couple items if those are good to go as they are, then I think we can releases this to production either this evening or tomorrow.

Client 4: So. Even just my clint, I were going through it in Ua on Friday. And scheduling and engagement him without a lot of those limitations was, like was so exciting. I can't wait to push out. So Well I'll I'll look at your comments today and we'll get back to you again.

Client 6: Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then regarding the edit matches stuff we've got a few tickets queued up to cover the remaining work. I haven't had a chance to look at those yet. Because I've been assisting with data engine and a little bit for stuff. So I will hopefully pick that up. Yep. Looks said it doesn't look like it's too much work So Fingers crossed, we'll see.

Client 2: Yes. And thank you so much, Jacob. You've based... You were basically been the bottleneck for all of the data and stuff.

Client 6: At sorry flow through you.

Client 2: So especially sorry for Someone simone who was on top of things and, like, asking well in advance and he's like, please help I need this, and I'm like, you're like third.

Client 2: I would thank you for all.

Client 6: Yeah. And then whatever Anna needs, I can assist with that later this week. I think she need something.

Client 7: I just need a buffer a label. That's it. It's fine.

Client 6: I need okay.

Client 7: And otherwise, the other things are gonna happen be happening in the matching algorithm them itself. So it's not very visual, so I won't be taking too much of your time.

Client 6: Awesome.

Client 3: Really exciting to see you also excited for these demo days and Sure they're gonna be a success and we're gonna be ending the year on a high with so many exciting releases that we can market right at Christmas, or kicking off the New Year with biggest feature drops yet. So good luck good luck with the final finishing touches If one question for the engineering team on.

Client 4: Running engagements right now. Are we should we continue doing that through the back end at this point?

Client 2: If you can run things through the auto scheduling do that. Our long term goal has always been to get all of the necessary admin work to be done through the platform.

Client 4: Mh just.

Client 4: Yeah. We we are not seeing the scheduling button in internal admin. We can't do that right now. Yes. So we can go.

Client 6: Jacob I... I'm looking into that. I did some initial investigation earlier when Penelope first reported it. It it works for me and looking at the code, it should be working. The data looks fine. So I will hopefully have an answer for you soon.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 6: Cool. Sorry. I don't know what's going on.

Client 4: Okay. And just in the in the interim it's okay for us to to execute them through air table?

Client 2: Yes. It should be okay. If you run into any problems, let me know and I'll fix it in the back end.

Client 9: As far as far as I know, like, look told on on Friday not to schedule engagements through air table, but if you want let's try it and Jebediah can double check if the engagements and emails are Schedule because I think it would be like very, very burden on the engineering time engineering team to wait for them and schedule all of the engagement that will comfortable through.

Client 4: Okay. Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. So let's try and and see if we can use the the old air table as a... Is basically just a a patch job while Jacob looks at the code.

Client 4: Cool Okay.

Client 3: Cool things that concludes the slide side of things. Anything else from any Anyone else?

Client 2: No.

Client 3: Awesome. Well, perfect perfect been excited to read regroup on Wednesday. Because luck we tying up loose ends, and have a great week. We'll speak soon.
