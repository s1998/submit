Host 1: That that's a big change.

Client 3: Morning. Well, this is Yeah. It's six Pm now when I moved to london and will be five o'clock, so will be. Or like a mint tea weather. Okay. But it's an issue. So I'm in a room where today. This is my third call and just like slow freezes. Bummer. I need to I need move.

Client 2: Really I have a really quick question on Octopus Ventures, security documentation.

Client 3: Mh.

Client 2: You know if we encrypt the data? Before sent to, like, Send or Mon? This such a simple question. I feel like we should know it.

Client 3: I don't know off the top of my head. What about Jebediah? Have S?

Client 2: No. Not yet. I just I just came across question and thought maybe you the answer they're... But I'll put in in.

Host 1: Yeah. The bd weekly.

Client 3: Yes. Oh okay.

Host 1: I I updated it this week. I think we have been using it.

Client 3: Yeah. I think we use it, like maybe every other week. Let's see. I'm share my green. Okay. Last two weeks of the year.

Client 3: I was just open with a prospect being like, hey. We're trying to wrap up contracts like this week focus on playing. What do you think we can do?

Host 1: Okay. You add I entered the top. Sorry.

Host 1: Like, December twelfth. Yeah. So I just... I added to the tub. And then I I figured table we would keep the table always at the top instead of copying and paste in and we just update it, and then we'll add the date So you can see the december pipeline underneath it...

Host 1: That's... I guess, why was my interpretation of it?

Client 3: So you copy and paste it and you Yes Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. So all the page one is updated December in q four. But then I I didn't notice your notes at the bottom.

Client 3: Well, I again... This is like, we... We can start a new one for twenty three anyway and how that as a rule done.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 3: Hello? Alright. You do you wanna do you wanna kick us off because Again, you'll have way more to report We'll see how we're eight hundred k french call.

Host 1: Mh. Yeah. So the only deal that is coming so far in the week of December. I? Bill you had a year five k last week. Right?

Client 3: Well, that's that was a verbal confirmation. The contra...

Host 1: Yeah. Okay.

Host 1: So we... Is not yet assigned contract.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Yet time.

Host 1: Okay. So that's the only Arr I've added, but I'll I'll take that off.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: Has been Really... It was the buyers, someone that came back after two years she she proactively saw we jump on the call. She was like, okay. We're ninety percent there because she was thinking about using it for a very small portfolio forty companies. And I said, honestly, for forty companies, we should be connecting all the graders we'll do the title matching. She was like, oh, you could do that. I'm like yes she was like, they is a percent done send me the contract.

Client 3: I was I think on Thursday, but it was already her end of day so just would had a friday what imagine probably still needs to get the final like sign off.

Client 3: So pretty sure this is gonna come through. And Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, verbal yes. We'll typically come through. So that's doesn't Okay. Well, besides that, because no.

Client 3: Maybe we should Yeah. Maybe we should just We're still at sixty. Okay. It a print. It that's pretty.

Host 1: So what I added here that that wasn't in there, is just our total q four deals. And obviously, we have one eighty in q born, our actual like at forty two in Arr for pretty far away from the distance school in q four. And that's that's not included in paid pilots. So... And these aren't paid pilots, but they're pilots where they renew. There's another thirty k that could potentially come in, and that's not... Yeah. That's not included here or a really helpful division.

Client 3: That's that's good to that's good to see. Thank you.

Host 1: Be So some good news. Yeah. Everything above everything in q four added is great news. Everything in in pilots is okay. Radical Vc, I like ninety percent gonna churn unfortunately and then in sort dot com, they both have contracts that they push their thirty eight are those really opt out to January sixteen. So we have until mid January to get them to to opt in, and then operators guild that's their twenty twenty four Opt out, which is end of December. So they could still opt out twelve point five k for twenty twenty form, but that seven point five is guaranteed. So it's okay.

Host 1: You know, total contract value in q four about seventy k still so that.

Client 3: Okay.

Host 1: What we're looking at in December Yeah. kids add any backed pc and sort of experts. Higher, higher likelihood, refresh miami.

Host 1: Simple engaged in email they're done in Miami. She's not signed yet though. But I don't think we've sent for an official dropbox sign. So she's doing a lot of back and forth. Same thing with the dame.

Client 3: So had a call with her on Friday, and she actually sent me a follow of email I still come through and I have not Yeah. And anyhow she's just... Okay. So it... It's not even like deal red it. But in the conversation, she she told me that she really wants announce or bit as part of her like her announcement and all the new she's doing in the New Year. She said it was between us and needs, and ultimately she really likes then it should put on some good intros through me and other organizations like I think Hr and Hr leaders that in new york based org. But just like ultimately, I love that. There's no profiles with you. Now, Mean, honestly, it sounded like a done deal.

Client 3: Yeah. So what's the what's the next step from what you from where you sound?

Host 1: Honestly don't know why I have sent dropbox sign yet. She has the contracts. But I'm gonna follow up on her message today and just send her a dropbox sign saying. by the way, you know, you can sign this whenever you're ready. I'm gonna answer a couple questions. So at least she has the next steps.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Maybe just literally leave with happy Monday, heard you had a great chat with On Friday. She's a fan. She's so excited.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Her question today was what's the minimum number of people that she has to invite to be successful.

Client 3: That. Okay. So we saved minimum two hundred but honestly, it's more like five five hundred.

Host 1: So they have a hundred...

Client 3: Many how many paid members did They have? So we Yeah. Honestly, it's five hundred, but depending on how many members we may have to adjust this.

Host 1: So they have a hundred and thirty paid members, but they have a community size about three thousand that she wants to convert in there then she has a newsletter at fifteen thousand So I'll I'll mention that we should shredded Yeah. Well we should invite all three thousand, but segment out the paid members.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean just think about Just think about that the average opt in is ten percent Right? So it's all about does the Opt the final number of options justify the cost. So... Okay. I mean they'll be at a hundred and thirty five members, if they get ten percent opt ins. Thirteen, that's like, six matches.

Client 3: I mean, they're on the lowest year, but still it could get expensive over time. So What was the one with three thousand?

Host 1: She has She said her community size is three thousand and she has a hundred... And of those a hundred and thirty are paid and that's not including her newsletter at fifteen thousand I mean, maybe if if she she strikes me as someone that has a really clear idea how she wants to use this.

Client 3: But I mean, you couldn't potentially if if if you if you feel all she's flexible on if she's still unsure equipped to use it, I would strongly try to the three thousand and just say, hey, we think this is going to be.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 3: This is This is going get a great way to show the community about the amazing people they have in the community and then to drive them towards the paid membership that offers a lot more Yeah.

Host 1: I'll try to hop on a call with her today. I mean, I because if I look at, like, eve wealth and radical Vc, like, I could just push him to sign you know, but if they have a first thirty days you know, they have a low rate in she's not a part of the We didn't mention the outdoor to her we.

Client 3: I didn't.

Host 1: I didn't. So Let me have a chat with her today and see if we can Yeah. Take the next steps.

Client 3: Mh. Cool. I mean, that sounds like a done deal.

Host 1: Yep. Yeah I just wanna Yeah. Start off in the best very possible.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely.

Host 1: So yeah. That one Likely. Yeah. Sorry?

Client 3: I mean, no. I'm just saying that at the monthly fee no matter how low it is for us, that's still if she gets ten percent, her paid members. That still thirty... This will take thirty bucks per per person. Sorry, per match. So it's it's still pretty expensive. Meaning, we should really try to get her to up size go into the three thousand if if you want to be a success.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

Client 3: Cool So You doing down this list here?

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: The Names really similar scenario. They have five hundred paid members. And I had to chat with their entire team on you know, last week, basically just... like, every single person asking a bunch of questions a lot of back and forth on it. Their Ceo is on the call. There there are more in, like, the defensive.

Client 3: When the call?

Host 1: I think it was on Thursday. So was there Internal meeting, and I just joined their internal team meeting and then off and they continue their team meeting.

Client 3: Mh.

Host 1: So Yeah. I mean, we we got into it an hour conversation. And they are more on, like, the the premium tier at fifteen k based on what they wanna do. I really don't know if that's that's within their budget. I need to chat. Like, specifically if that budget makes sense because it won't went from five k. To ten k, not a fifteen k hyper to confirm that actual number. If they're gonna sign by end of year. So I think there's a really good fit here. They're really wanting to match. Instead of doing automated scheduling, because they're spending a lot of time matching people up. So if we start lower and work up to premium, maybe that's something I can get But Wow, so basically, the entirety...

Client 3: How big is the team?

Host 1: I don't I don't know. There was there's six people on the call including me. So five other their team.

Client 3: Do you go well? Because sometimes when when you're, like, out outnumbered by that much, it could be a bit weird.

Host 1: It went well It went well. I mean, the What can I say about this call? The Ceo So if it was up to the the champion, she would just use it. Right? She's super into it, She gets it completely they have like, a really interesting workflow in terms of getting power partners to take a an end up survey and they connect them based on this survey.

Client 3: And it mh takes a lot of time.

Host 1: So we got into that So I think it went well. I think and we're positioned the right way. We just gotta connect them pricing.

Client 3: Okay. But in the future, you know, you know, People can help Merry wants to be on calls like that, you can help with product queries I'm I'm happy to help like, we can contact talk team because six to one is is quite be quite note number there.

Host 1: The only reason I didn't add anyone, it was because their team meeting where I joined it? I thought I'd be on for, like, twenty minutes and then i'd hop off just turned it into something longer. But Yeah. I did I did concern Inviting Merry.

Client 3: Cool. Yeah. I'm up to you. But always available to tag team and people These are the exciting conversations fresh blood first dollars yep. Late stage. Cool. Alright. So do they have an agreement now?

Host 1: They have an agreement for ten k right now. So that's that's in their hands. And I need to connect with them there tomorrow. Right.

Client 3: Okay. Alright. Well, that's the biggie it seems for for December so let's Yep. Let's say close to them. The day. So that's I mean that... I haven't sent them an email yet. Right?

Client 3: From once you haven't...

Host 1: I have a list of people that I'd I'd like you to. I can add in some contacts. Is that something you wanna do this week maybe after I update that sheet. I think it'd be good to...

Client 3: Yeah. For sure. I mean, it's needs it's it's fifteen k, the biggest deal that's that's I think, yeah. But I think that's gonna go down really well. And I mean, I can also offer a separate call, it helps with the founder Yeah.

Host 1: No. That would be a perfect one to to edit so i will do that. Today. It's on my list.

Client 3: Cool.

Host 1: Okay. Yu ubi, I have a call with them. I've a call to champion today. We've already done it three calls two with their Dms. So I'm catching up with her and I'll see where they stands on things, they're very interested. They're still interested. I need to determine if it's gonna be this year or no. And I'm gonna try to push to you know, lock them in. But I have that call later today.

Client 3: Okay. Cool.

Host 1: I also have four called this week with e learning platforms, like their brand new first calls definitely not gonna happen in December very unlikely, but they're they're good to one four, maybe closing in January if it's fit.

Client 3: Mh.

Host 1: Laboratory is another one. He's really on the fence as well. He's more of a yes than a no, but we're aren't a chat last week and Yeah. We'll, love to catch up with them this week and he asked about pricing as well. So These are my top for December.

Client 3: Okay. Awesome. Yes, sir. Just like things up in my head. Okay. Well, good news on Max, we got an actual proposal from them. Bad news, it's rounded up for us paying ten k for the sponsorship. And it was a little bit then on on actual commitment to using the product at Let me see if I have an. Do you see Do you see summit now?

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: So actually, Galadriel, we were working together and we glad it and we didn't see that. Product placement, but actually, it's the number one point over here. Says C on your product placement. Ai will be on onboard the C team and the Same community the the product will be introduced in the Facebook group limited share in the C community newsletters. Again, I can... I have sent some commentary to be Okay, guys. We would let commitment for this to be used twelve times. It's not something that's introduced it's something that's run on a monthly basis and you trying to push for a clause where We also... They they use the emails. Yeah. Our email function on the team. Now Vc platform, do they have their logo? Or do they have what how does how does the logo placement work with Vc platform?

Client 2: Don't know actually. I'll have check I felt like we started with...

Client 3: I think we started with something that was more dual branded and now, i it's almost exclusively return it's what I see responses end users. Okay. Bottom line is I'd love... I'd love to put this app for the decision making. We paying ten k for this i ten is a lot of money but it is supposedly access to twenty thousand people in their community, lately... I mean, The the... It's not all community managers. There's few community consultants in there. I think we noticed that both from even from the C chat form and I linkedin in with a lot of people that are community advisors. So they're not all buyers, but actually even if it's advisers is that try and and advise their clients that that could still be a win. I think we're at a stage when probably we should give most things a try. And we know that with B platform, it works. When it's actual community of buyers, and it would take one... Well, it would take one pro deal to pay for itself. We'll get a ton of visibility and I we'll be able to really benefit hopefully from a new channel.

Client 2: Is there any there any way we could do, like a six month? Term with them and see, tested it. Before n, like five k for six months before jumping into a full year.

Client 3: I could go back to him with this with this. I also gonna ask him for for payment terms of two payments of five k anyway.

Client 2: Yeah. It might be worth seeing if they're open through, like, a like a trial run, like, we do. Right to see if we get leads from it.

Client 3: Yeah. My own here is that It's in a good case scenario, if they see how many leads we get, What it they lap on a much clarity afterwards.

Client 2: You don't have to tell them how many leads were getting? If we can validate it, internally, then that will be good enough for us to continue. I don't we don't necessarily need to share the full number and disclose all of that with them. I actually think that's really uncommon in partnerships.

Client 3: Right. What if... I mean so I went back to the I already pushed to close this clause, this is definitely pushing it much further. Because their partnership tiers, they have partnership partition packages of their light. Thirty forty k. I we're saying can repay the bare minimum and commit and the product and had read the we're the only partners that they're agreed to do this.

Client 3: And now I'm like, And can we make it six months in case we wanna bail out I'm kind of thinking that we ask for the payment terms and at the back of my mind is I don't know if it's really not working. We don't pay. We pull out of the same mix event last minute. Without building into the contract, then I'm gonna be chasing us for five k if they agree to the payment structure. To make the contract months?

Client 3: Schools on and half over the year.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. We could do that.

Client 3: If the agree. And I'm hesitant to even ask them about that. I think you're on this strategy since he write his email, but he was a little bit pissed off because I I kind of read this and I responded By the way, I was wondering three. I thought we talked about the digital package at that seven k And this one says gold, and how's like... Well like, what is this? I think he got a little bit confusing because I said we can give away a product that ten k on annual basis. He still wants us to pay ten. In fairness, I think he's also thrown in a few more benefits than the actual digital partnership. But anyway, i I I be okay with sending ten calendars on this and hoping for the best. I clearly always over optimistic when we got the power partner awards. I thought we're gonna get six that week and I don't know if you received even like one from this thing, and we paid two and a half thousand dollars the freaking license of the logo, not to mention to apply So, yeah, power partners, it cost us three k maybe helps with converting deals and it was a fun thing to win for all of us, but and I'm sure the. But would lava Yes, no.

Client 2: We just go for it.

Client 2: Okay. And yeah. If we can try and work with them on payment terms to make it more flexible, but This is a hundred percent our audience and if it is an next platform, You.

Client 2: Confusing.

Host 1: Agree. We know Vc platform, that partnership works. And if this is another way to do that, I think ten k is we're gonna get Roi for sure.

Client 3: Alright. Then we're doing this. And unless thing really so fingers And then they can really pissed off about me asking for the payment terms.

Client 3: It it should be a done deal. They were. Yeah. It seems pretty pretty pretty warm but. And then your back vc, it's the Uk based Vc fund where the buyer came back. Up to two years, we had a great great catch up. She's really invested She's also... Yeah. Already been relationship she told me about future your career changes he's planning on making. I'm gonna be helping on that front. She wants to do coaching owners.

Host 1: So hey are they actually using the product, or they just announcing it once a month under newsletter and these these channels Are we talking about Dm x?

Host 1: Yeah. Sorry. I'm doing move I'm from C.

Client 3: Yes. Back b. But no worries. Yeah. I definitely won't want to clarify that they're using it right and like introducing it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And then startup up experts another community referral from a client Mba they were claiming and they have no budget, and they really really want and really saw them on edit matches while we took a train call together. So now they really want to idea, and they were they're trying to also somebody make get a partnership, but I'm like, okay. We have. One partnership that were focused on end that T x, because it's it's Hr meter is an leaders hang anyhow. Not a partnership, but also don't have much of a budget. But the Guy... The buyer actually said, okay, we're gonna do the five k one. Has a contracted place and he's very, very invested. So I will He had a follow of question after the contract and I bought it, but I'll go back. He's some of that response like pretty instantly. So I'll I'll reread it see if I actually answered his question. I think he was to get the group feature in that in that plan. He's like he's a sneaky one. I mean he's like, try to get the entire contract feel free. Now he's trying to get certain features. I'm like just give me the five k. And let's see how it goes. And if we're getting partnerships if it's going well, and him you mind be joining the community. So I'm like, now, all of a sudden again the Coo was your personal account manager, That's a solid benefit, sign the contract yeah. I'm getting... I'm feeling pretty good about those five k ones.

Client 2: Yeah. I have the orientation call for that community tomorrow.

Client 3: Okay. Perfect.

Client 2: All in a party tomorrow night virtually, which I'm going to yeah.

Client 3: Oh my god.

Client 2: Nice keep popping up until they sign the contract.

Client 3: Yeah. You're like jumping straight ahead into into the fund. Good. Well, Octopus ventures, see, like, I mean, it's scheduled to convert into annual contract ten. Now in two days, So let's see, definitely not getting another free pilot if we can help it. Bald ten. I mean I can I can try and chase, but they didn't respond to my last email. Clock tower adventures, Those are the ones I wanted to start at the end of November. Sent the follow up with the December timeline. I wanna heard back now two emails, so it's pretty much those two five k was over here. And then Ls generates. Yeah. Not counting on this one. They're super super slow. So it's more for Q one. I guess. So Yeah. I'm basically you're pushing trying to push twenty k.

Client 3: Those sixty for the month. You fine? Partnership. I'm staying focused on the big one. I'm staying really bullish on C.

Host 1: I think the C x is gonna be a big deal.

Host 1: Are you finding a few are pushing conversations because it's December No.

Client 3: I think they're pushing comes. Yeah. I mean, because we're not a priority. That's what I'm reading between the lines.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: I don't know just finding that. With, like, this buyer, clock town ventures, she's like, I get it. I wanted wanna run a bunch of experiments Ps is important for us I really get the value of mortgage. And which we still extended a contract. They will do it with we pencil in the onboarding call. I just don't understand. She's an act head of platform. That's her job. And even for her, it's like, It does it, but it's not necessarily exactly what she wants she's also focused on the used case that G wanted, did a that turns you with more interested until that connects their portfolio to biz opportunities. So a little bit more of the ac asymmetric matching. Like, automated But still, it's it's a close to a perfect use case as possible. I didn't seem like budget it was an issue. She's been there for three months. So if they hire her I'm sure they've given her some sort of a budget. It's more like the other thing that's that that that'll nugget is the Strategy jump really waiting for the whole strategy to come together. It's the same one with Boulder. They did the survey and why they wanna get in insights. They want to, like, have this pretty on a slide, maybe someone to prove it and really know how orbit fits it to say a slack purchase, into a newsletter fitted to a a summit, I guess some people don't have that natural new beginning new strategy timeline, maybe they're running on their own. Time. I don't know. But it's written frustrating. Because Bald didn't Literally said, yeah, we have the budget approved from a barker. They're also pretty ready to go, and then a new person join and derail. You. What what else can we use? I've used the twenty twenty two pricing. I'm use on the waived onboarding fee.

Host 1: I don't know if there's much more we can actually offer them at this point.

Client 2: Yeah. Hi. Great. Like, if they're not moving at this point, then they wouldn't be good customers.

Host 1: Mean, as as the sales strategy I think we're doing everything to push them across the line. I think the only reason that we're up upon a few people like clock to tar ventures is because of we don't have enough in the pipeline. Right? So if we had, like, ten other people in the pipeline. To Venture is a big deal. You know what I mean? I think I think that's the only that that's the only thing I I'm seeing from this. And I just think it's it's part of December that's what I'm thinking and me because we haven't had enough say, yes. Into, like October November to, like, get us through December like system basis. That's that's what I'm thinking. Like I i I don't think there's any... Don't think there's much more we can do with them.

Client 3: Why cambridge up here. I'm just checking Yeah. I I think him with my friend again. She was, like, wanted over. I'll let you know the moment the you new support new vendor craziness away, Deloitte Uk. I also try to be like Hey. Do you have the terms from from twenty twenty one, which we said we're gonna honor on twenty twenty two. We didn't we didn't kick off the Poc. Like, we need at least something sign in writing in order to be able to confirm the Poc terms. If it's true, I think that might push her into action because she's claiming that she's gone in the support of partners and yeah. Of like, partners and interesting interested managing level, deloitte stuff. And if that's true, they she wouldn't wanna risk getting that about something that's not happening. But we previously have the sales consultant who was the deloitte are the biggest time where just doing diligence on new technologies, they never buy any and, they just waste people's time not a single startup up i've, like, work with actually I think we do like, you should like cut losses, which is why I was a little bit more start in the last Team being like, hey way something in place to commit resources. We can, like, plan for this.

Client 3: This should be a lost and I think it's in lost in Salesforce some fused.

Host 1: It looked It looks like you have to update some fields forward to be close lost.

Client 3: Yeah i did. I'll double check afterwards. Mh Oh, the other thing is I'll try to... So hubspot inbound the annual conference, we were supposed to have a follow call with the senior lead, think Guy said yeah, I'm trying to get the dates and then as and respond to two chaser I'll chasing you again tomorrow. But I will try and get something in place with the director of community, who wanted to run tiny task he didn't respond. To we say, hey It's a really busy time of year. Our buyers are very busy. So let's just And that's, you know, let's circle back in the new Year. So at least I'll try to sign up lock him out the pilot. For one. Am I try to do that. Yeah. All in this basket.

Host 1: That'll work.

Host 1: When you started pushing on Dc Did you ever give it away the products? Or did they buy it right away?

Client 3: Sorry. Put you away for free? For for clock tower, that's not even an issue, I think.

Host 1: I years ago. So when you first started selling the product to Vcs, did you ever give the product away?

Client 3: Yeah. When we were mostly doing free pilots at the beginning.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, We're starting that with like, Kin. Right? Mckinsey the academy may... To do a free pilot, but is there reason not just to onboard as many free pilots like in a new industry, like el learning or like Com hubspot. Right your mentioned Ham hubspot. Is there reason not like, get them on more as coupe as possible.

Client 3: There's a divide over here because I'm... Yeah. I'm fat. I think we're also to stage where we need to experiment and we need to get people through the door.

Client 3: You know it hit do a logo bra especially if they're good logos. I cubs spot in the end we're giving it away for a grind and a half if he agrees to this tiny pilot anyway, but he would you just said it's about twenty thirty people. Just to get them to charge anything. So I think if we've quantified it at least for our purposes that the audience is large enough. Nine we think there's something in there. At this stage, I wouldn't have a problem with with giving it away.

Host 1: Yeah. It would just shorten them the sales cycle and get a logo and maybe you maybe shorten the sales cycle after this logo for other people board.

Client 3: I think What wouldn't give it away wouldn't give it away to someone like rad obesity though. Not... I think I think at some point we reached the consensus is that we're never giving it away to five k clients. So for essential, we never give it away. We just give them an opt out if we really must But especially for pro premium where we think the audience is big enough, and the logo track do Yeah.

Host 1: I'm only thinking learning, only like new people all so, like, I wouldn't ever offer, like, a free trial like, june learning, now that I've gone through so much process. So like, you know, you don't wanna cut your losses completely. But if they're to come back to means say no then I have nothing to lose in all from a free trial.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: And I don't know if that's where we're at with Help hubspot. At this point, I think we're at that one with, like, Course ser So like, you know, would just get him on in any way possible. I mean, it's it's a zero sum for us.

Client 3: Yeah. And, has your opinion on that change given where we are with the revenues?

Client 2: I I just worry about, like, the Cs capacity of it all. If it's gonna be somebody like an eve wealth that we're doing it free, but there tremendous not work. And probably not gonna not gonna turn... Or not and never new you know, but I totally hear it. Like, can you try and get the revenue if you can't can, and then we just have to try other things.

Client 3: Yeah. But the lesson there is that we started with group. Right? It wouldn't it wasn't even like the plain van vanilla, there's still a big there's still a big learning. Curve over there and we should we push away new clients away from group if possible.

Client 2: Yeah. I guess I'm just saying it's like, they're is is not even just group. That so time consuming about eve. It's like, they're very, picky. They're Incredibly time consuming customer.

Client 2: Even if it wasn't a group is just not a great place to start period because you won't get great offense. But outside of the the performance like, they are a needy client. So like, radical Bc free, but, like, not particularly needy, you know, pretty self survey spending too much time on them.

Client 2: So like we didn't you know, totally maybe worth the shot, but I just... And I'm not totally against it so that we have to manage the capacity see what I'm saying. You know, it's like, a balancing act of.

Client 3: Which is well... I mean, let's let let's make this form to discuss these one of because we try to avoid them if possible, but for certain clients, yeah. If it's If it's for me, if it's el learning and we're trying to find out is this product fitted to a new industry We don't have time to lose because we we really wanna see for ourselves but something that we don't know for a fact if it's going to work we're saying it's gonna reduce your completion rates. It's going to get people more engaged. But the reality is we don't really not that's the case. So I'm way more inclined to be offering a free reply into el learning to get there faster.

Client 3: I get the good results. And the logos, hubspot similarly, I mean, literally, a one and a half k pilot. He's pretty much giving it away for free. So for me in my mind, yeah, That's free. if we can get them there, that would also be something pretty minimal a l line. But not another radical Vc and not at I agree. And if I have to be completely honest, like, it green fig, figures an account that I knew know was going to be called. It took... I mean, you just know by by the number of emails that go back and forth. Negotiating the contract. Every little thing. I mean, you just know. You know who's gonna be straightforward. A delight to work with and you'd know who's gonna be a pain. So I I do agree giving it a away for free to people that are pain. It makes them respect the product it makes them respect the product less, you're already starting off on the defensive, like, pushing something onto them if negotiating that hard. And then yeah. And it's like extra annoying when someone difficult turns. They've wasted a ton time and day turn.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: But Both for example, Bald done, I'm gonna go back in stream I ever offered them a free pilot, and I'll say, if you can commit until the end of December, maybe I'll maybe I'll try and get them on a free pilot in January because It's a large bond It's a fun that we're really to get to know us as a potential investment partner It's a large enough portfolio. It's a use case that should really work very well. Just like in me and we gave it way to octopus. I think with European, I think with European prospects and particular, we would have to need more with value. Like, they are cheaper than I think Us. And we can decisive them. And for them, and also a lot more risk ave. Yeah.

Host 1: When it was... I think we're missing something. Like why couldn't we get in el learning across the line. In three months. I think that's what I'm wondering. And is it because we haven't run a product with them for the value probably, I don't... I think that's that's my only reason to lay and grab a logo right now.

Client 3: So where are we with Judy and where are we on June? Well... I mean, Ken, we offered it for them to to them for free.

Host 1: Yep.

Client 3: And June what was the latest there?

Host 1: I was gonna meet with Jimmy last week and their other Dm was I was sick. And so I didn't push to reschedule right away. Maybe this week, maybe next week, maybe that's something signed by end of year it's it's tough to know. They're they're very into the product on a call. With us. Then we did another call after that. That luke call. So they they said do us the process is very long. And the biggest thing that they know there's value, but they need an internal cell on if we adopt orbit, we're we're changing up our entire workflow. So we need to, like, basically commit to orbit long term And so It's it's it's not... It's not like the budget is the big deal. It's the cost of switching which is the big deal. Any loop in someone into Any you loop and mini team members to confirm that this is okay. We've sold basically three people the line. Now we gotta do one more.

Client 3: And how big is the audience?

Host 1: How big is the June audience? Thirteen hundred students six hundred instructors of about two thousand total. They have sixty courses Sorry, two thousand people per each course or two thousand people across sixty courses two thousand across sixty courses.

Client 3: So they're going to be matching two thousand people each and a separate audience. It across sixty audiences essentially.

Host 1: I'm not about the courses is. I don't know if that's even relevant at this point. The number of courses maybe maybe this relevant in terms of that being a way that they're gonna segment these parents in these instructors, but they have students So they're connecting their thirteen hundred students with six hundred doctors and they're doing it many times every single month. And they you look very simple way to get these scheduling in the instructors calendars. The parents, the students are not worry about, then make sure these structures are gonna show up.

Client 3: Okay. Well, this just... This is basically asymmetric matching.

Host 1: That's Match making is a check. Yes. This is something we need. To scheduling is this ability. Okay? Yes. It is a value because you can do what we need the we prove that to them, And I think there's a little bit of work on the products that we need to do. I mean, they know there's a little bit of work on that, but they say okay. Let's check both these boxes. Let's say you complete the product and now these both work. Now we need to go make sure that, you know, once we switch to orbit, team is gonna be completely okay with it and things are not gonna break. Right? They can't have like And I don't know if that's something we can control besides having a conversation with them? And, like, proving that to them, but going now interesting.

Client 3: Because right now, we have a couple of clients that really that scheduling kills like, kills the opt rates? And they wanna get rid of scheduling and then you have prospects like juno, pretty much only one to use almost like exclusively for them the big value and scheduling.

Host 1: June. Right?

Client 3: You do? Yeah.

Host 1: They're looking... Their pain is no shows. They're paying is instructors not being able to show up to students. So they wanna provide their students with this much value is possible and they think that if they make it easy for instructors, a lot more meetings for the courses more accountability and more completion rates. So i think because I'm I'm thinking if you managed to jump on a I mean, We we managed to jump on a meeting before year end, but I would definitely be pushing all deals to potentially be closed.

Client 3: By the end of this week, because I feel like next week it's just like we have our year end. I mean, next week is a write up. I don't have a some single external call, and I think many organizations will be on the same pace and then realistically how many people will i to be signing deals. So everything you should think of this week as the final week of December. Whether you're taking holiday or not between Christmas and and in New year and I don't think you are. So in your mind you're counting it is a few days, but Right?

Host 1: That's why includes Uni. In a December. I just... I mean, I don't think they're gonna sign off on some like this in a week.

Client 3: Unless you make it really attractive, Yeah, I wonder if we managed to jump on a phone hold with them this week, And just say this is a big offer for you If they're matching that many people regularly, I wonder if we could quantify in terms of time saved and the comparison of like a full time salary maybe they need two ops people to do this constantly.

Host 1: U. I mean, I've I've walked up pricing on them quite a bit because we started, like, ten and went to eight and now we're talking, like twenty five with some extra work on it. We're not even to the conversation of can we approve budget for this much? It's more Is this possible? Okay. It is possible now let's talk about budget, and now like about timeline. There gave me a timeline. They didn't say December, that's why didn't include them in there. Can things change in a week with this dm? Yeah. It's possible. If I get a call scheduled this week, one gal. A loop in. Let's let's both be a call with both of them. Let's see if they can get us call call schedule this week can see if they can move forward. Okay.

Client 3: I was gonna say we... Yeah. Before knowing that he as discussed pricing, we could, like tell them that typically on account and product customization of this level, is like fifty k, which is fifty percent like an ops manager that would be doing this manually, it would be doing it better how price of a full time hire and we'll be doing it better. And we're providing them with more data and then just say end your deal fifty percent off, give it away. Give it away for twenty five k. Like a twenty twenty five k deal would make a ton of difference at the stage. Did they have a if we validated a pain point, does it make sense With only two thousand invites a month.

Client 3: If they're spending a ton of time, Yeah.

Host 1: I mean, I'm trying to stick to, like, standard of some kind But... But they're they would like, sixteen matching rounds. Per month, Right, which is way more than what we're doing. So I I think I think it's still under discovery at this point.

Client 3: That's an important yeah, piece of information. Okay. And they want manually the plan them.

Host 1: They're building stuff in house. They built something in house that's not working the way they want and this is a big improvement that we can do a lot more with it especially with the scheduling. They can match them up and things like that, but they can't the scheduling is the biggest thing.

Client 3: And they like I was scheduling they like the way it works they've seen it.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Okay. Have have we talked about a paid pilot and how much that cost.

Host 1: No.

Client 3: Okay. Typically do paid pilots if I think it's necessary.

Host 1: I mean, you know, I don't know if it's necessary to get them across the line at this point. If they give me back And again for sure in January, maybe offer paid pilot to get them in December and then upsell them and into January but they haven't give me that indicator yet. They're pretty consistent with scheduling meetings.

Client 3: So is the ball hour court to now offer them new times? Or do they have their scheduling link? To pick a new time.

Host 1: I I sent her a link to pick a new time last week when she said had to push and so she hasn't gotten back to me So I need to follow up today slash tomorrow to get her in the books for this week next week.

Client 3: Use it.

Host 1: The dm was sick. Mean, I'm not I'm Sorry.

Client 3: What's the d? What what does it What is the title? What is the deal?

Client 2: Decision maker.

Host 1: Oh okay. Yes. Sorry. Decision Maker.

Client 3: I was like.

Client 3: So So I was gonna a chat with the product lead I a chat with her I think they're the director of marketing.

Host 1: And she was I don't want... She was tough, but that was like, a hurdle to get over. Now we're over at now we're with another person, say, okay. You know, I need to get a buy in from this person on the transition. So if we get these four people to say, yeah, this makes sense. Then I think it can accelerate to close.

Client 3: I I I feel like you... I mean, Yeah. You've had the calls. So you know that they're progressing at a certain pace. I like, really pushing for this one because we've been... Yeah, beating the drum about text, so this would be even locking them in getting some commitment to do something. Whether it's just the pilot mean, I did just a paid pilot, not not such a big commitment you can position it as hey, is gonna be risk free. Why are you say typically with you pilots like or flat field five k But I, Drug connecting with you, but it's... you know, just before Christmas we do it for just would just do it for two and a half k Typically we do three audiences, but let's just say two and a half k five matching rounds. Fifty percent discount if you sign before Christmas, I think the big question is Is it a budget thing for them?

Host 1: Right?

Client 3: And... Well, no. It sounds like it sounds like it's more of a processing for them, but imagine now they're saying we are proposing switching to a tool that we think is gonna work well. Versus... They do paid pilot that they can put on a credit card. They do a small managed experiment, and then they go back to those people. If there's any blockers then they get the buy internally with a ton of good testimonials and data.

Host 1: Yeah. I can go back with...

Client 3: Switching to anything that works I mean, I I judge from ourselves as a buyer, switching to anything. Is so painful at this stage alone is already used by sixteen hundred students paid students.

Host 1: Right.

Client 3: So it's an actual business risk for them. It's not even Right.

Host 1: So the question is is a paid trial gonna get them across the line. That's the question.

Client 3: You can try try maybe you just say, hey. Hope you're feeling better. Try get trying to know the decision we see if you can jump on call. I've synced up with the team. We're really excited to work with you. I have exciting, like, offer to discuss with you live. Then just keep in mind that you have some room to maneuver But, if we could get any commitment a, we really need it and deeds in a market that we've be beating the drums for a quarter now that we wanna unlock and you've gone the furthest yeah, It does seem like I mean, education moves a little slower, but it also sounds like you've done a great job in and visiting them that the product could really help. It would be shame to, like, lose moments I also worry now with like, holidays, early New Year, people who go holiday around Christmas, and Del go around.

Host 1: How many they beginning of january like, things could fizz out even if they're excited, like don't.

Client 3: Like, it it could really out. And it seems like it worked hard to get them to place.

Host 1: Sure. I mean, yeah. It's it it's it's a bummer that she got sick at the wrong time. So I'll I'll follow up.

Client 3: Oh she's only human, but I think she deserves an i just just stay what you've recovered I just think up with, you know, our leadership team and they're both excited and we come up with an attractive offer do you have fifteen minutes to send how while, like, talking through it.

Host 1: Okay. I... It's saw my list for to follow today. So will try to get that meeting. I'll include that wording in there and then i'll I will push a paid trial if I'll push it page.

Client 3: Right. Okay. Good. If you try, and, I'm sure you'll succeed, you're pretty successful at what you put your mind to add.

Host 1: We we had Pioneer academy. And this... The only reason like, I'm I'm hesitant I'd pioneer your academy. Right? Really good call. I think they're good use case. They're not. Yes. Like, I jumped to a contract pretty quickly. But she's just, like you know, I need to loop in other members of my team. Right? Which which is always the scenario. A Is not gonna sell them. I guess that's I know when I get someone a on a trial, not even like a paid trial, I don't know. I just wanna get an agreement at the price. You know what I mean? That's that's my number one. So, like, reduced churn, that's my resistance to June, because I have put in a lot of work with them.

Host 1: I don't want to short after only two and days.

Client 3: Yeah. I hear you.

Host 1: But I...

Client 3: But, hey, money sooner is better than money later. More what... Yeah. I mean, any any couple of thousand any good news to report Galadriel, are we how how do you heal about that strategy? Would you would you drag it out for full contract price or try to get them out on a pilot.

Client 2: I I think it depends. I think that if you try it... Sometimes you push these deals too hard too fast and they pay fizz sooner.

Client 2: They get frustrated and it feels more like you're pushing too hard and if you just had waited like, a couple of weeks it would have come to full fruition. Yeah. I I would leave I leave it up to later. To read the room on that.

Client 3: Yeah. No. I agree. If we start, like, if we send them an offer, and then it's, like Did you see my note? Did you see the offer k? One time going on, going twice Let me be your or, I mean, there's is definitely way to be annoying. There's also a way to be I feel like nothing that indeed does could never be really annoying.

Host 1: So...

Client 2: It's also like, offering them something that's not valuable to them. Like, offering them something that isn't going to entice them, Like, maybe a fifty... like, tell point, maybe not price sensitive and, like, to the cut isn't going to make them move faster. It's just gonna make them say, okay, well, I still need to do this anyway. So it's still gonna take a couple of weeks.

Host 1: I can picture them coming back and, like, hey, thank you for the pay trial.

Host 1: Yeah. We... That's not an issue for us. You know what I mean? Like, I I can just see that happening. But again but you never know. Right? Galadriel it's it's tough.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: I'm just thinking if they do... It if they have something in place that they've built internally, is gonna be somewhere a lot of resistance of whoever has built this. To switch the process, because they'll be like, well, we control it. Know we come both data does this other the company do? So adam of these four people that they need to get by in, I would we're literally we're the bigger unknown Mh.

Client 3: The pilot is not so much to get together to to give them the discount. It's to give them the reassurance and the data. Hopefully, that we can help them. But Yeah. guess let's just see that woman. The best case in scenario would be if you feel if you like, hey, feeling better got some ideas like wondering wanted to check any one for fifteen minutes.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: Try to get on the phone, but News is the good news is the champion who's pushing this along as not sick just the other person.

Host 1: So I'm... I follow with her and, you know, I'm sure books.

Client 3: Oh decision maker is not the champion. Someone is influenced and been Okay. Got.

Host 1: Got it. Yes. Sorry. I'm using terminology that's i should Are we, like, using that terminology, like, the champion the Dm, all that stuff?

Client 3: Yeah yeah. Well, Abbreviation are hard because they sometimes mean different things to different people in different industries, but, yeah. I know what a decision maker champion. It's just in real realize, there's two personalities. Cool. Okay. Well, I'm in Inspired to chase a few people now and see what what I can. What I can get through the line, We didn't talk about pipeline already for q one. We said we're gonna talk about the to about something and you're gonna put it on the agenda, and I go what it was. So I hope you around the agenda. You remember?

Client 2: I actually ping him this morning about making sure that we had workflow for Yeah.

Client 2: So That looks good. That one looks great. I mean, hopefully, that one was a good lead because that... And this is more of it direct Cta. The white paper was more of a read our read our paper. This is more of a get in touch with us, we're a power partner. See how how you can leverage our to be your power. So those should be good. But, yeah, all of those lee that are coming into to partnerships. I think this point, it should just be the power partner award demo requests and There's some newsletter requests that come in there. And then also, I mean, I actually haven't one, but we do have an application on there for community in orbit. They will all come into the partnerships email address. And they do sync with Salesforce too. So It it sounds like you have workflow set up for them.

Host 1: Yeah. So do you on on every form that comes into in partners, Frodo, You want me to take action on them. Right? Yep. That i have been. Okay. And and there is a flow for the part with the power partners and that new lead is in it right now. Well, Great.

Client 2: Awesome.

Client 3: Alright. Let's push push. I'm going to. I'm gonna first first thing going back to C max see how I can get get us five thousand deals in q one. That's my goal.

Host 1: That'd be big good luck. And I'll I'll send you some just at the end.

Host 1: I'll send a couple names for hitting up these k.

Client 2: Bye.
