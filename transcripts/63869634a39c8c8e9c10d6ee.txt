Host 1: Hey richard.

Host 1: Good. How are you?

Host 1: Like you're in the office today.

Client 2: No. Yeah Here my the office yesterday a different part.

Host 1: Oh, cool. Awesome. Well, I have Denisha do. It looks like he's running a little bit late on another call, but he's just for extra support. I wanted to make sure that we got our best and final in front of you. Yep. I know that he wanted to also validate a couple things as far as, like, Well, one, I know you said, like, any could work and like you could make causal work, if you make fireworks work, you make it a egg work, but I am curious to notice because, like, I I it's pretty clear that we're a little bit more sophisticated and I just would love to know, like, if you see that as a benefit if you think you won't utilize it just because it does help us to understand like, if we can't make pricing work, are we actually gonna be chosen or is it still like a toss up because you know, It's hard for us to put to really give everything if we're like, hey, that and day they might choose something else.

Client 2: We're know look you're not gonna know until I'd go to the board no present. And I come back with the decision say. I mean know.

Host 1: But like we're up to you and, you know, obviously, hopefully, you give you recommendations to the board, like, from a perspective like product, and not pricing. We'll just love know where you stand on that end.

Client 2: Yeah. But I mean as I said, I mean, like will work. It work slightly differently. I mean, the other thing is, you know, these products are static, So what any of these products look like in two years time, Is is an unknown. That's obviously kind of my out of my assessment.

Client 2: Mh not choosing a product just for a year or two. Hopefully.

Client 2: Yeah. You know, so all of that. Of goes into it. I mean, the other one of the other things I'd like understand so How you how pricing would expect to change as we grow.

Host 1: Mh. Yeah. That's. A really good point. And hey hey, Denisha.

Client 3: Guys Cyber being late. Richard Nice to meet.

Client 2: Very you. Good. Thanks.

Client 3: Doing good. Yeah. Sorry for being late. At turns out to everyone waits till last end of the month to buy Mosaic, but it's a good problem to have, I guess. Appreciate you bearing with a delay there.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Okay. I was just kinda validating with Richard far as like tool functionality and richard to your point as far as, you know, you're buying its for what it is going to be. We do have this awesome webinar coming up. I know you're pretty... You've been diving into our content, but If you are thinking, like more long term, work really coming out product updates a monthly basis, It's pretty impressive actually. And so if you did wanna see, like, Hey, how what kind of big it's coming? Just in the short term, and also in the long term. I think they kind of touch on that as well. Definitely a good one to a attend here just you... I know actually timing might not work out, but you register then you do get the recording. So a good one for you your time.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Take a look at that. Thank you.

Host 1: And as far as, like, how pricing will change, I'll actually... I think we should go through the Seeing that Denisha and I discussed. Because one of them is option, we'll actually give you some clarity into that. But then also, because we have Denisha here, we're actually looking at changing the way we're doing pricing in the New year. And so Denisha is more privy than I am and he can kinda speak to that and also the benefit of was eighteen rather than later.

Client 2: Okay. Cool.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Awesome. So If you remember, we talked about the two options here, this is the list price you discussed last time leaning towards the bundle, which includes everything we discussed. Which lands at twenty four and then there's a three thousand implementation fee. So Denisha and I had about this morning. I told him that you board tomorrow, we want to put our best foot forward. And so we have two options for you kinda to like, you, you know, choose what's gonna work best and also obviously, discuss this and see if it matches what you want. So your one option is just a one year agreement, we are lowering it by four thousand dollars with list price. Waving the implementation fee and then also giving you one free month there. So Essentially, if you divide twenty thousand by thirteen, most five by twelve, annual y is out to eighteen five, but it is a twenty thousand dollar contract. Really just helps us keep a little bit of a higher value for, you know, our, but same time giving you that lower amount that you can expect like, a lower monthly essentially can like?

Client 2: They telling a you it. These is still low Us dollars yeah.

Host 1: Yep. Selling us dollars. So we would so when you take up the payment in us dollars.

Client 2: Yeah. So I think I mean, that's obviously an issue you guys selling him to markets like, Australia because, you know, we don't. We at this stage, in organization we don't we don't really sell into the Us so into New Zealand in a little bit of Singapore, but, you know, it's sort of or local currency. So, you know, from my point of view with where the australian is that everything on west doubles. You Worth noting we do have...

Host 1: I would say more than a handful of early in New Zealand customers. So it... I mean, is it just the exchange rate that's an issue or the fact you're actually paying because it comes up in conversation, but...

Client 2: Well, it's. Yeah. I mean his the exchange rates massive issue at the moment. And some of those customers may have dollar revenue coming in the we'll hedge. The Us dollar cost. So I have this I this conversation constantly with supplies out of the Us that guys. Us are relevance may. Snow re. I mean, it's It's it's not you know... And that's That's that's me is the potential customer. I just highlighting. It's not relevant because I'm got Australian dollars. So it's just... And, you know, some some have been very good in terms of doing very you know, a flexible pricing to to to recognize that obviously, from there one of you... You know, they're really wanting to put more stakes in the grounded far back. It's for all the benefits that that that can bring by having your product down in locally in the cases ecosystem and talked about etcetera, etcetera. But it's just it's just a... It is a it is a very important point because of where the currency right now, which is really really bad the buy side.

Client 3: Yeah. Totally. Yeah. I'm I'm following Richard. It's definitely something that is less than ideal. I mean, we we've worked a a lot of prospects in your area to like when we started conversations, things have like reg even during our chats with them and punctuation itself is kind of something to to keep tabs on and I'm on on the lack of, like, you know, Us, you know a revenue pipeline on your guys side.

Client 2: So Yeah. It's it's a...

Client 3: Just that we we obviously are kind of hit on a little bit, you know, less directly, but from our international customers. So the the... you know, the coming down on the price at this point, the way of implementation and then the the months. Like, if you can't tell yeah, definitely trying to get creative as far as like, ways to work this down just because got have considered that on the approval side. When those ran this up. The other side of the point is that, you know, we also have, you know, kind of a, you know, heavy expenses on the Us side. So Naturally, this is kind of a model for us of support if we go to, you know, much below these areas, but Yeah. I definitely appreciate the feedback there. It's not something that we, you know, love in the current economic climate.

Client 2: Yep. Okay.

Host 1: Richard kind curious just to know like where we're landing. Where is causal and, are they doing Australian dollars? Like, if there is a number It'd be helpful for us to understand like, what that is.

Client 2: I definitely I think I've factored it in write a discount on that currency side. Maybe it's is pretty thing. I don't know.

Client 2: Once still that they're they're ultimately still out governing governing country with delivered nation.

Client 2: So I don't know.

Host 1: Yeah. Well, Richard and the reason why we can't you know, slash our prices, maybe as significantly is I I do wanna show you that i oops that is not correct, Para. The pricing that I have proposed to you is already discount for us pricing. Pretty much if you guys were not seeds stage or over thirty five employees our typical pricing is three thousand and five thousand one implementation fee. So the we don't have Sorry.

Client 2: So what so this was one of the important things. For me to understand. So ...sorry. How does the how does the higher fee kick. What what are some of the metrics in terms of now that that kicks in for an organization.

Host 1: Yeah. So it's based on when you start with Mosaic. So if you guys started with us at Mosaic today, you're not gonna then jump to thirty thousand Usd It's just that we essentially look at complexity of the organization because really, if you're a small organization in your seed stage, you're Bro mosaic, it's a lot easier to grow within a tool than it is to be complex out side of a tool and try to fit it in. It actually creates a a longer implementation time for us. Just in that complexity. So if you were to start with Mosaic today, you have that lower price point you're not gonna jump up in you know, a bunch of cost just because you're growing a company, it would just be incremental from your base price because you're growing and your... You're already implemented mosaic. But that I just wanted to show you this to show you why we can't get that much deeply discounted because our costs are still from this point and anything lower than that, we're really not... It doesn't make sense for us to bring the customer on because we're gonna be pretty much losing money. So if you compare it to our typical price, it is taking five thousand dollars off. It is getting, like, in one of the scenarios more than ten thousand dollars off the list price, which is over, like, thirty five percent off. So this is a pretty... I mean, it is extremely just kind quote compared to the value that you'd be getting.

Client 2: You shouldn't. I mean, you shouldn't be losing money if you have decent. Lifetime. Value retention of companies such as us. I me if if you if you turns low, i mean this is this is where all about organizations make their value.

Host 1: I think I think But I do...

Client 3: No. I think this is Oh sorry. Leaandra to jump in. Yeah. This is a message that we're constantly telling our our reps Richard, it's just around the of the first share cost of support and stand up.

Client 3: That's more what Leaandra is getting at. Obviously, yeah, if we retain, you know, the majority of our customers then naturally that's a make that'd be a part of our recurring business. So Yeah. That's probably you overs find that for our our folks Leaandra And one thing is to say on that is that Causal does not have, like, what you would call like, a white love implementation approach, It pretty much is, like, build all yourself.

Host 1: Like think you'll be super impressed with how much our team is hand me through the process and setting up and doing all the coding the back end, whereas calls essentially, like, Hey, you don't have an implementation team, like, you can pay for it or you don't have to. With mosaic, there is a lot of actual back end coding that has to happen to make things out of the box for you. So think that's an interesting one because know, I guess I've made a around long enough but.

Client 2: We always hear that story and I mean, I've been on implementations. Nets week was for one. It was an absolute horrific in terms of what i client was you know, there's their support their white glove implementation, whatever whatever you wanna call was And then you you... You're right. I mean, others this is just nothing. So You know, it's trips proofs in the pudding, I guess. You know, one of the things I would like to do if I sort you again get get approval to move forward is to talk to one of your australian customers. As a reference.

Client 3: Excellent.

Client 2: Someone that would stick my Australia language, I've managed to do that with a causal customer already just because Calls introduced to me originally through Deloitte. Then to be quite heavily promoting that down here. I don't know. I'm sorry they had a customer i sort of already knew of. So I I started off this look at an F fp i tool through one of those discussions. But that's... you know, that's that's very valuable. And yeah it's something our customers do. With us as well. That we we heavily promote as well. Just so, and that's one of those tests, you can say. I will how did you pick implementation go. What was what was important, such that there's a bit of independent verification of that Mh.

Host 1: Yeah. We can definitely do that. And I think I'm not sure if you met by the next week. Implementation that it was, you know, a nightmare and hope you're not expecting that one mo because I think that No.

Client 2: No no don't don't go into it with the expectation minute. I wouldn't. If I had that expectation over need we'll be trying to buy something I just if my end my model and my own dashboards and all that sort of stuff because, you know, yeah.

Client 2: We really that was really is pretty awful to be honest.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: The good thing is we're definitely not a migration. It is a integration process so the data's are there. It just needs to flow into the won't be set up and plugged the right things. I think I sent you this just to give you one more confidence, of course, we can do that reference.

Client 2: Been have been through this. This was This was one of mine earlier for all of the products, so I spent. Instead of half a dial saturday looking at all of this is good. Oh nice. One of the things... Sorry just jumping back with.

Host 1: Mh just so to understand how our prices would change is grow.

Client 2: Over time you mentioned sweet come in at low the S b level, but you know, is it is it users? Is it revenue is it what what's how would it how would it how is the the new fee reassess you by you?

Host 1: Yep. It's a good question. So one thing that I wanna talk about is this to your option where you do have a locked in rate Mosaic is always gonna be unlimited users unlimited data, so you'll never have to worry about that as your financing grows. Like, if you do choose to go with Mosaic before year end, then you'll pretty much be grandfather into this like, all can eat model where we're not gonna be changing the way that you're your structure is price.

Client 2: So, essentially, any increases on the yearly renewal will be on your base price of percentage.

Host 1: Rather than different skus and different data amounts. So I'll let Denisha speak a little bit because if you do decide, like, out this decision to the new year. Our pricing is changing in January. And so be a whole different story. But if you get in on this pricing, then this is, like what it all would like for you.

Client 3: As what we tell.

Host 1: Sorry. What's was that?

Client 2: That's what we tell our customers.

Host 1: Are you planning on bathing and switching that?

Client 2: Price is gonna change in the month's time we'll Whatever.

Host 1: One was Oh, I see.

Client 3: Well, if you have...

Host 1: Gotcha. I mean we're servicing up to, like, series d customers with like, thousands of employees and a lot of like, huge data scale. And so charging them even, like three thousand dollars is kind of putting last a bind because not able to get more value even though they're they're getting, like, a lot more value out of Mosaic. So essentially the way that we're moving to is more like value based. So that way, as you grow and as you get more complex, we're able to support you more and then obviously, our our contract value is capped it like a thirty thousand dollar amount.

Client 2: Yeah. We have a local categories in terms of how pricing. For you know, small it small to large. I mean, there's is about six different categories and I think you know, our lowest sort of about eight thousand in our highest is sort of two hundred fifty from a license point of view. So is a huge huge range. We sort of we progressively move to that as well because It was just such different experiences of how our product would be used.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. And what well Leaandra that price change. Yeah. It's it's something where we're more so just like our bundling. You can tell here, we're kind of just quoting you for the whole kit and cabo, but next year we're moving towards a more like, product by product, kinda a la carte pricing. And that's where we expected... you know, and it's fair to to categorize it as being, know, a little bit more next year, not logically just doing at the end of the year here, but This pricing would would hold you in that product bundle, hold you at this rate and then, yeah, the step up there is just like a pretty standard percentage year over year. For inflation and product updates and areas like that. Or we have the option as well just how be discussed at renewal. We have work with some org that are maybe struggling and they rather just how that be discussed or renewal in case their business is like, maybe a bit since then. So... Both those are options. For you guys.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay.

Client 3: Just one...

Client 2: Got. Sorry. Just one question. You know, Do you have customers that So we sort of Sort of completed a series small series I where that is necessarily been series i this is no So vc. It's just individuals. This sort of looks like a series i as we get further down the track, you know, one of the most important things to me is know having a tool that is not my which is more robust once we start to have more sophisticated investors. To stay to your customers to... Today once they're fully implemented Mosaic and mosaic is all their dashboards and live. Today typically is part of there. Investment process. It's a bit rather than, you know, taking snapshots of putting everything in the data room. A. Is it possible to be did today traditionally let investors in through through a log just to have a look at that financials within mo because it it appears to be It's all that's perfectly suited to that. Absolute transparency. Live. Data that someone could look at through their they're their investment decision making, due diligence.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. Absolutely. A lot of our customers do that today and that's part of the reason why we have the unlimited users is because you can invite anyone you want whether they are internal or external.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. Close.

Client 3: Yeah. Couple things we done actually specifically for that workflow, Richard, because we're actually seeing that more more than late more than ever really lately because of Vcs wanting to get more entrenched in the guy gritty is that Yeah. We can give anyone, you know, the proper level of access. And then we also due to market conditions and do this trend, You know, b is getting more and more involved. Also have the ability to give a few different levels of access so they can, like, have a read only think about his basically just like a stagnant Pdf or slide deck.

Client 3: We can get the ability to drill down or the ability to edit. Then furthermore, you can actually hide specific data points. So if you maybe for a certain group, you don't want to disclose salary information or something like that on a person basis, you can hide that as well. I the prominent Vc firm insight partners is one of the ones week I line with where their data pack now is, like, pretty much the Mosaic template that their customers use. So Yeah. Oftentimes too then if it's a problem you see, they'll have some experience of Mosaic.

Client 2: Yeah. I think it just helps up. Right. Played transparency that Well, it's the new world might automate the old world that certainly that you will.

Client 3: Now. Absolutely. Yeah. Is that something that you're seeing on on your end? You guys think you're gonna get kinda investors more and more involved. They kinda seeming to be more granular in there.

Client 2: Now say. Yeah. Well, I i should. And I think they...

Client 2: Yeah. I I just... I I I know the profile of the investors we've just we ramped up. With we've gone up in our sophistication of investors as individuals on the next rise, which is really how it'll be international expansion rise.

Client 2: You know, that would No I would expect then we'd have some institutional investors come on board. So. You know, that to me that's just a ticket to the dots to be doing something like that.

Client 3: Dollar. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Makes sense. I mean something that we could definitely support and The other tools is although, I think, you know, helpful modeling and reporting tools definitely lack the debts like, populate the equivalent of a board deck something we're probably a little bit i didn't be positioned to this with Got gonna I call in a couple of hours with salesforce likely.

Client 2: Just to talk to them about integration of all of these tools. I reached out to them. So I've got that interestingly again guy out here, didn't know Mosaic. He's not the integration guy, but he's our account manager. Similar to the the deloitte chapel bed. Now maybe Yeah. I mean, deloitte got some sort of thing going with close bit still. Surprise that he sort it didn't. Say you might say even me if he's got something going with calls but that that was a bit surprising. Yeah.

Client 3: One thing... Yeah. Typically...

Host 1: I'll go ahead.

Client 3: Kelly. On that End india. Typically, the Salesforce ecosystem is so broad that newer players like us sometimes do slip through the cracks as far as awareness. We... We're not like a official, you know, like, in and software vendor and his other classification on the Salesforce side. But we do use our native Api and it's a connection that we stood up for probably at least a few hundred customers at this point. So something we definitely familiar with. I wouldn't be shocked if they don't know our name, but Yeah. That's probably not too atypical given the number of tools that try to grab Salesforce data, I guess.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: And we also don't require anyone from the Salesforce side, so I'm not sure, like, we can do all the integration ourself, which is why they probably wouldn't get involved. I mean, we could just do it with you or whoever, like, own sales on your end, there isn't any for key or anything to Salesforce.

Client 2: Yeah. We might problem salesforce at the department is. Data going into it. Just rubbish.

Host 1: So you know, we need cultural change for that be valuable because it's moment Still valuable.

Host 1: Yeah. And honestly, we hear it a lot. I think I sent you the Crm guidance, but if I didn't, I'll send you it again. We have three different resources on that just because we see it so often and can definitely help you guys create some kind of autonomy kind of, like, fields or whatever it is you guys are needing to create more automation around it.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Anything else?

Host 1: I mean, any questions on the pricing options? I know the Usd isn't ideal, but if you were to choose one, which one seems more enticing cheek as far as, like, aligning with your internal needs.

Client 2: Well, I mean, sort of pretty similar.

Host 1: Yeah. I guess the question is, do you care more about a low, like a lower first year cost but you're okay with more of a commitment or is it more attractive to just go, like, the one year pay on a number basis, like, a little bit more, but you're pretty much getting the same value.

Client 2: Not I'm not sure to be honest to me. It will also be you know, was once once again. Once I get a approval the board they. Go through the process. With our founder up. Something like that can be dependent on whether he's having a good day or a bad day.

Client 2: Got to be perfectly honest. But that level of granularity. And it is a bit of it it is a bit of a to the court. I may not You know you certainly got... No problem. Commitment. To tool like this because tool is commitment. Like it's a real commitment. That's why the decision making process and pass is longer because this has to be a tin new decision. Let me, just test yeah. We know that. For some of our customers, you know, when I got from a very large video strategy. And buy products. Such as the australian tech office you know, it's a very long term decision there make because there's significant investments around that. Where I one part of that How it's not, but know, this is This is a long term decision.

Client 2: You know, absolutely. You know, for whatever happens to this company, you know, this is being this would be the tool we would be using it. And I think, you know, if we can still We can... We can expand a along way with the the product, you know, with with zero and stuff like that now, you know, we like serial, you need to go to something. Figure better or whatever. So I think and also you know, it is... Which you recognize less. It's the perfect time. Whilst we're the size we are to implement something now.

Client 3: Yeah. I. Question for richard. I'm realizing I'm going through my notes here on the approval that we ran to our c founder for those pricing. One thing we didn't know and I I understand for that disclosing, but one thing we didn't know with confidence was the price point four ka and pride, particularly with this piece it is a little, I think could resonate with our approve. It's like, a final swing back on this. Would you mind disclosing either of those price points just so we have some reference maybe, you know, where we need to go to our competitors?

Client 2: It's probably while they probably arthritis probably a lot different, but it's really down sort And I did say that stuff that he said to be about. The the the legal case that's It's pretty that i now. Don't know how you actively try to hide something like that. Think that it's not gonna pop up know as as a financial planning company too.

Client 3: That's a tough the act like you weren't privy to. Yeah.

Client 2: Just how how it doesn't pop up. But I've look at it's you're about fifteen per second more Okay.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. Gives a some brand reference Awesome. We'll we'll take a final stab at it. I mean probably a clarification that it won't get moved because we we were pretty comprehensive, but hey this thing we didn't really attempt. So Yeah. Leaandra let's tell if after and say one more shot at might as well.

Client 2: Yeah. No. I don't I've been around i've got cool Yeah.

Host 1: As far as next steps, I would love to connect with you after the board meeting, I think we aligned to doing that. So would that be good time at the same time tomorrow or one would be my board meeting is tomorrow afternoon my time.

Host 1: So okay.

Client 2: Could we could check Friday.

Host 1: Perfect.

Client 2: Okay. Cool.

Host 1: Invite or Friday, same time we start today.

Client 2: Yep.

Host 1: Awesome. Cool thanks for.

Client 2: Thanks Denisha.

Client 3: Thanks, Leaandra. Yeah.
