Host 4: Jebediah. You're on these next?

Host 2: Alright. Let's see. This week I've been working on workflows. There's some exploration there. We sort of simplified the idea to be more like just Slack integrations where you know, you can you can have all your meetings posted to Slack and then we're working on some ideas around how you could have, like, some sort of conditional like, statements set up so that if a meeting meets certain criteria, it would post in a certain channel. So still working on that. I think we're moving the the sink until Monday.

Host 4: But it sounds Yeah.

Host 2: Yeah. It's gonna be kinda cool. So, like, all meetings that have, like, the longest monologue, for example, like... Or maybe a a long model log stands out. Would be added, like, filtered out and then added like posted in Slack or you could you can configure anything. Like if if it mentions a competitor or I guess the the sky's is the limit. You could ask the question. And, you know, if the query response is a certain thing, I don't I don't know how we'd set that up. But yeah. It'll be pretty cool. So so... Yeah. Look for that on Monday. And let's go with Her Thanks.
