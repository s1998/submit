Client 9: I was gonna say, I I don't even realize that the new logo hat was an option Now I'm now I'm feeling a little left out.

Client 11: Yeah.

Client 7: It's not Hold on everybody.

Client 8: Prototype. Larry has got as special snake peek.

Client 9: Larry it's just tech flex honest. Showing us the latest and greatest like, working into a parallel line just work in the new apparel.

Client 9: I know. I got it. Well let's good on your brother. It looks great on you.

Client 3: So bet then true we're gonna just stick with this until the box arrives.

Client 9: Right ain't broke don't fix it is what I Wallace has his on.

Client 7: Very nice.

Client 3: We got We got four of us. We got one more we have a basketball team.

Client 3: So it's it's eight zero five, and I want to turn it over to Larry and Hamilton to kick us off. And then we'll jump right into the review of the software sales process.

Client 7: Great. I'll start that i then you can follow me. Look, We appreciate everybody's time. We appreciate especially during the end of the year here, And and congratulations on signing a deal yesterday, everybody. That's a big deal. Right? Signing deals, and and that's kinda why we're here. Getting aligned with the marketing department, get in line with customer us getting aligned, with new sales and and our sales department.

Client 7: And and really, following a process a model that that we stick to that shows results that we we evolve as we go through this. But but they were more aligned than ever, marketing, is more aligned with sales product marketing customer success and and and and sales everything around a prospect, everything around lead generation and having real data that supports that growth of the pipeline and the opportunities and also has that data that shows the nurturing of that. And so I appreciate everybody's time at the end of the year. To sharpen our skills, sharpen our alignment, so that we can have an even more I think a solid year, than I'm already anticipating for twenty twenty three. Because if we work together as a team, if we apply processes We work diligently. We are cow There's nothing that can stop us. We are the best provider or business system software and solutions in the heavy duty truck industry and it's not even close quite frankly with regards to the platform, our people and our customers And so thank you. Let's take this all serious and then apply it and then account the accountable to it as we go through it. And so that's what I'm looking for. And I talked to ben it I've talked to Jeeves, I've talked to Josh a little bit. And of course, I've talked to Jericho. Flattery. So I'm excited about all this, we're investing in this and And I think twenty twenty three again gonna be great here. Go ahead, then.

Client 9: Well, look, So so I don't have a whole lot to add past that. You know, like larry said, like this is the end of the year. And and I know that things have gotten at least up from the Nci side I've gotten a little bit crazy here down the stretch. You know, I guess what what I'd asked of us here over the courses of the next few hours it is to be is focused on this as possible. So lots of emails come through. Lots of clips come through. I guess... And and and brother flannery. I'm glad to ask here for forbearance here. I'm less it is Todd Bite. Unless it's Chelsea Conway, telling us yes. Or Vancouver Island, Tell this yes. Other than that, we don't exist the next six hours. You have my permission to answer todd Maintenance call, Vancouver islands calls and conway beings calls other than that. You know, we've got we've got about half a day a little more than half a day that we're gonna dedicate to this. Like, Larry said, this is this is a a a big focus area for me. And and I know that Jeeves and the marketing team shares our commitment here as well. We we tried this Once... And we've learned some good things from it, I think the big thing we learned from it is that these trainings are only as good as you pick them up and use them the next time. And so, you know, my focus for twenty twenty three, is going to make sure that we all are are continuing to work better together. I think we made big strides in twenty twenty two. Got some... We've got some run the run. And we've got some... We've got some area here that we can get a lot better. Like Larry said, you know, when you've got everybody pulling on the same side of the rope. This is a really tough thing to be. So this has got my intense focus in twenty twenty three it's got Larry intense folks in twenty twenty to three, and i'm I'm sure Jeeves is gonna not have recognize the Jeeves is gonna be like as you're on this as well. But this is this is gonna be key for our the difference between twenty twenty three being a good year in twenty twenty three being the best we've ever had. So we're we're gonna make this stand up. And so let's get locked in and focus for the next six hours. Everything except for its closing those three pieces of business can wait.

Client 12: Except for Drew can closed Baltimore in just a couple of hours. They are going with hosted services. So drew, you are allowed to close that one in that phone call.

Client 9: Alright.

Client 9: Anybody else There you go.

Client 9: They don't exist. We'll talk to him when we're done Alright.

Client 3: Very good. Well, thank you, Larry, and thank you, Hamilton. And good morning, good late morning. I think that would be the latest we have on this call. To everyone and welcome back to the proceed software sales process. I've met most of you a few of you have not not Jericho Flannery and melanie and her cat are here from our team to work with you today, in a six hour segment, which is really five hours because we're gonna take breaks of what is a two and a half day program Those of you who went through before with your razor your hand place, You came through with us in three, four hour sessions. And that was thirteen hours. So what we're doing is five about thirty five percent of the... I'm gonna call it the Ps because it takes too long to say, proceeds software sales process each time. of the Ps p. So we're gonna go through five hours. Over a six hour period, we're gonna take breaks and leave a little room. If you do have one of those accounts come up, if you just drop a note in the chat and let us know that, I get it, that's cool. We've done these Zoom meetings We did them all during twenty twenty. And you can tell when people are multitasking on Zoom. Particularly for those of you who wear glasses because I can see your screen and it flashes and I've done this long enough to know when you're texting and, u. U u. Like, my kids when I'm face to face with them. So let's just be respectful each other's time. I do understand end of the year pressure I was in Europe last week, closed an opportunity. And if I don't get them everything by tomorrow, they're gone. They're gone till January third. So mutually understanding of the pressure that the end of the year brings a couple deals coming in fantastic. The purpose and use of the Ps p is to help you increase your probability of success. We're not here to go through a homework assignment. We're not here to go through training as training event, We're here to take a look at concepts and theories and I'm I'll have plenty of those to share with you. But the real test is what happens when we leave here. And when we did phase two with Larry, the document I said said, will review this with you, but then we will follow up and coach with you on live opportunities moving forward. Which is why we ask each of you to send us a live opportunity. Said us a live opportunity And today in this session, we're gonna look at those opportunities. And I'm gonna ask you as we go through and an overview review of the Ps how does this apply does this apply? And how can we help you increase your probability of success? Ec, marketing. All of these exciting pieces and you have a lot of good things going on. You have great things going on at proceed. So how do we help you increase the probability of success? Josh and Diana, and I had a very good conversation. Then it N i've had multiple good conversations that I talked to Larry to restart this whole conversation about a month ago, when I was walking my dog through his neighborhood. So here we are. The purpose is to increase the probability of success we're gonna do it for about five hours of content We are gonna do a skill development exercise Does anybody know another... phrase for a skill development exercise. Feel free to speak up unmute yourself and speak up.

Client 2: Test ish i'll play or role playing And who jumped out of bed this morning had said, can't way to do a role play.

Client 3: It's gonna be fantastic. Oh my god. I wanna play poker with those of you who raised your hands.

Client 9: For sure. Jericho, Jericho, before you get going too far here, your slideshow here is loan shown as your back end. So if you want to be looking at a slide where you're sharing the wrong screen.

Client 3: Thanks for the heads up. I hadn't even gotten there.

Client 9: Didn't want it. I didn't want you to get into your flow have to interrupt you there now we're good.

Client 3: Thank you. Are you good.

Client 9: Yeah. Well, I you're good You could set it Perfect.

Client 9: Yeah Okay?

Client 3: So we will do some skill development. We'll do one skill development exercise when we go into groups that have conversations Because the Ps is a skills based program. And whether you're e i Ci i marketing, whatever the functional role is, There are skills that you use to interact with customers and prospects on a regular basis So we're gonna go in and we're gonna do one exercise in that regard. And then we're gonna go and take a look at the opportunities that you brought to the workshop. So it's a hands on interactive conversation as we go through And I hope all of you did all of you get this printed, did you get your manual printed, can I see a show of hands or does everybody have this document ready to go? You don't.

Client 11: Okay. Great. I meant to do it yesterday when I was in the office, I dropped the ball.

Client 3: Okay. So please pull it up electronically And then please somewhere have the ability to take notes. However you take note Because if you can remember all the things that we cover, in ninety four pages, and we're only gonna cover a third of it today. Your memory is a lot better than mine So please have the ability to take notes. But again, the real test is on the opportunity that you sent for us to review, how do we apply what we go through in this? Five hour session That's the real test. Then when we're done, I'm going to follow up with you ben it, I'll get with you, Larry, Josh. We can take a look at the opportunities that were set in and say fifteen or twenty minute conversations or how are we gonna win this piece of business? So that's the coaching part that follows up. We can set it up formally. You can do it informally. We can have conversations I could walk over to Sea Avenue, and Larry could buy me overpriced lunch and we could do it there. Whatever you would like. So the real test is what happens when we walk out a year And we had some good momentum that in February twenty one, but it it dropped off. And Hamilton you said that we gotta pick the tools up that we're putting the shit. Any questions or comments as we get into our curriculum? Or emotional allowed outburst, they're allowed as well. We go for it. We're good to go. We're ready Tray tables are s, Larry. Is your tray table s, seat else Fastened I'm excited.

Client 7: Yeah.

Client 3: Me too.

Client 7: It's always gonna make a noise. I was gonna make a look I was gonna do something to really energize this environment, but you know? I just didn't we're ready to go.

Client 9: Go. Anytime you got Gary Hicks on the line, the the the energy is already there.

Client 7: Right?

Client 5: It's primed ready might have sent us over the.

Client 9: I appreciate your forbearance.

Client 3: How's the... How's the screen look here? You see the front of the back?

Client 9: Back So there it is.

Client 3: So please, if you have your manual printed out, you see on the front cover first page And the first place I'm gonna go to is page six. Please go to page six in your manual. And here is a very busy slide because the Ps is not about selling Although we reinforce selling skills, and we talk about concept and theory, how to improve your probability of success? Melanie remind me again to Nick you c host when we get to the exercises. Okay?

Client 3: Okay. I can't do it right now when I'm in this share. It's really about buying and boy has buying changed and my screen just froze. This is... Here we go. Buying has changed it certainly changed again in the port pandemic. But this slide was built by a gentleman by the name of Neo Rack. And Neil Rack wrote a sales training program called spin selling. Has anybody heard of spin selling just to show our heads? I'm sure some of you have And he talks about three phases that a buyer goes through. And then he talks about based on research, his team did two thousand different buying selling interactions The three phases the buyer goes through, And then he talks about what's important to the buyer as they go through the three phases. So across the top you see phase one phase two phase three, Phase one for the buyer is called solution development you would write that into your book if you have your book, Hard copy otherwise, just make a note. Phase one is called solution development. Phase two is called evaluation, and phase three is called commitment So solution development evaluation and commitment on the North South axis is what is important to the buyer as they go through these three phases. And in phase one, that top box the most important thing to the buyer is there needs we're gonna put a different phrase in there. We're not gonna put a needs. We're gonna put in primary business objective. Or Pb o. So if you please write that in, to that first box, the Pd o. The most important thing to the buyer in phase one Are Pb o's? Their business needs. And then at the bottom of the column, on phase one On the East west axis, This is what the buyers looking at. Here's what the buyer is looking at in phase one. What does that word say anybody just call that out What are they looking at people And in early opportunity development, For a customer or prospect who's using your competitor's solution, They're looking at you Now, yes, they might be going on the website.

Client 3: They might have gone a cod had heard about another system of course, But in the early interaction, they're looking at you. And how long does it take them to determine the credibility of that first person that they talk to at proceed how long does it take them to determine your credibility Say you don't know them you haven't met them before. How long does that take?

Client 3: A minute I think Larry being generous Gary, how long does it take him to determine if you...

Client 5: I was gonna say minutes?

Client 3: Minutes what part of the south living.

Client 5: I not bad this out.

Client 3: Anybody think it's quicker than that?

Client 8: I am gonna guess thirty seconds.

Client 3: Thirty seconds Jan, I think you're being generous drew. You raised the initial and second.

Client 3: Ten seconds And so I say what part of New York are you from? Because it goes quickly. They can go really quickly. Y. What do you got? In the south it could be a yaw Here, Larry could be a dude when you're in the parking lot over their Cardiff state beach, it goes quickly and how do they determine if we're credible or not? How do you as a buyer determine if the seller is credible josh? In your first interaction.

Client 12: Lee comes down to, you know, do they look in their eyes is the first one?

Client 3: They look in the eyes then what?

Client 7: I thought it was firm handshake. If it's a firm handshake, you can close the deal every single time Okay.

Client 3: So it's eye contact. It's a handshake, What else. Do they base your credibility on Confidence preparedness and the words that come out of your mouth knowledge knowledge, just in the industry.

Client 7: Right, Knowing that you have that knowledge of of what they do.

Client 3: Knowledge of the industry, but the latter part is more important. Knowledge of what they do or what they're hoping to accomplish. What's important to them? What are their business objectives? And when you take that first meeting with a key player who's got a competitive solution, and you don't know them do you know their business objective? Probably not. Maybe you got a good lead from Jeeves, Maybe they called out some things. That they were really looking for. Phase one, For the buyer is called solution development the most important thing to them are there business objectives? Other business objectives. And I am having some real problems here with my display.

Client 7: It's back. Had lost us there for the...

Client 3: Okay. But it's back. So phase two, is there evaluation Phase two is their evaluation. And how many quotes do they go out and get in your world. How many quotes do they get? When they're thinking about making a change, anyone how many quotes did they go get Jodie?

Client 4: Three they got it.

Client 3: Like, they can't go out and get one. Right? They can't go out and get one. So they go out and they get three quotes. And they go into phase to their evaluation. The most important thing to the buyer in Phase two is proof. So in that second box, please write the word proof.

Client 7: And we lost your screen again. Just so you know.

Client 3: I'm having major problems. I might have to up.

Client 7: Over there you want me to walk over and help you out.

Client 3: You know what? Put put proof and box number three. A beg your pardon box number three is proof. In the evaluation proof of your capabilities is most important. And your proof has to match what in phase one Group of your capabilities has to match what in phase one. Dave wants it have to match in phase one? The most important thing to the buyer and phase one?

Client 8: It needs You're muted people.

Client 3: Nope. Their business objective. They're their needs of their business objectives. So the capabilities you offer have to match their business objectives. But you can only match their business objectives if you know what they are. And some of you wrote in that the business objective is the cusp of the customer is to get a system that helps them with increased visibility into data. For instance Do we know what that is before we send them a proposal or quote? Do we truly know their business objectives? Or do they send us an Rfp? Do you get our piece or Rfid i's, rf Ten should every once in a while.

Client 9: Not very often.

Client 3: Good because they're often a waste of time. Because they say send us the information Melanie, let's do that. Let's have you share the screen that's a good idea. I'm gonna make you the c host. Because I am having some functionality issues here, So hold on one second. And I just made you the c host. So let's see if you can get that screen shared I can see our participants Okay? So Phase two, proof of your capabilities. It's up there melody, but it's very oversized. Can you think it shrink it to one screen. So phase two, proof of your capabilities is most important. Now the buyer moves to phase three. And the biggest concern of the buyer as they moved to phase three The bottom box on the left of that North South Axis is risk. Right in the word risk. Particularly when they're switching vendors. Dean what's so risky when a Customer is switching vendors switching to you or switching away from you. What's so risky?

Client 2: Downtime costs, the user, experience the unknown because proceeds proceed said it was going to be great.

Client 3: Gonna do this this in this we're gonna rip it out on December fifteenth and on January third, Magically, you're gonna be up and running seamless integrated and robots. I don't know what any of those words need. Seamless integrated robust. But it can be risky, Right? And you've heard buyers say this to you They get bunched up. They say the six most Expensive words in business We've always done it this way and now they're gonna make a switch. So they're headed for phase three risk. So there's three distinct phases that the buyer goes through. And in the last opportunity that you engage with the customer and Josh, this can be an existing or Hamilton and the sales team, this can be new When that key player was considering adding proceed capabilities or just considering proceed in general What phase were they in when they got to you? Were they in phase one phase two or phase three? Anyone?

Client 12: Think it varies. Sometimes for us. It is... Most of the time it's phase one but sometimes it is phase two Well, if it's phase one, that's good because what are you talking about if it's in phase one?

Client 12: The dissolution. The options.

Client 3: No. That's phase too and phase what you're talking about them their business objectives. Here's the challenge. Some people call you and say we're interested. We heard good things about you, send me a quote. And I'm not talking about your existing customer who's gonna buy from you. I'm saying somebody who's shopping. When they say send me a quote, What phase have they pulled you into?

Client 9: To They bet they pulled you to two.

Client 3: What's wrong with this picture?

Client 9: We don't know what the problem is.

Client 3: They've skipped phase one. Who did they do phase one with?

Client 9: Themselves.

Client 3: Themselves, the competition The neighbor's babysitter Suit brother uncle who works for the competition, We skip phase one.

Client 3: So what do you say when somebody calls who's not currently buying from you? Who's considering looking at your system What do you say to them when they say send me a quote, vanessa? What do you say?

Client 1: You're on mute. I I know. I had it mute.

Client 1: Yep. It doesn't work like that. It's hard to just give them a quote and give him a price if I don't know understand what exactly their needs are. So I really tried to talk Him back over into phase one.

Client 3: I don't... You do. You do. Your job is to get a rope and pull up back into to phase one. So what do you say to bring them back to Phase one?

Client 1: I explained to them that I I need to under on what they need. I is, like, going to a doctor. I can't just prescribe something without diagnosing it. So just kinda try to you know, depending on the prospect and their personality. I kinda trying to feel out. I obviously don't want to not give them what they want. So kinda trick them into going backwards instead of forward. From where they wanna start.

Client 3: Do you ever tell no? When they ask you for a quote, and they won't spend time with you.

Client 1: Try a nice way... Know, I guess no. I have never actually given a hard note. I just tried... Yeah. So no. They answer to your question is no. I've never just said no Okay?

Client 3: Well, what do you want? If wanna quote... What do you really want to do? If you're willing to send them a quote what do you want?

Client 1: I wanna identify their their business objective.

Client 3: And the last workshop I did, I asked I said to a guy, what do you really want? He said a purchase owner? Of course, you wanna a purchase order.

Client 1: Right?

Client 3: What you want is time to spend with them. So not if they say send me a quote, When they say send me a quote, You can say, yes and send it to him. Probability excessive of success is not high.

Client 3: You could say, no. I'm not gonna send you a quote. Or you could say, I'm happy to send you a quote, and you spend fifteen minutes with me next week? To discuss what's important to your company if you were using our services. And if they say no to that, What should you do They know that.

Client 1: I...

Client 3: It's not like It's not my style.

Client 1: I always try to get a fifteen minute discovery call and now that we're talking a little bit more about it. I do ask for ten fifteen minutes of a discovery call find out. So but I've never said no. So yeah.

Client 3: You're right. Well, I would say At the end of the day, if they're just shopping us, they just want pricing.

Client 1: They're not really serious anyways. If that's all they want is just to check a box and have another quote maybe but I've never just said no to a customer, but You get paid for sending quotes?

Client 1: Absolutely not. But So when they say to you send me a quote, try this for let's say, based on neil Rack research, I feel you're artificially pulling me into Phase two.

Client 3: Therefore lowering my chances of success.

Client 1: Okay.

Client 1: really I'm putting that at a book called shit I'd love to say to customers.

Client 3: And I'm sure you have things that you could put in there too. But we know when happens We know that they're shopping and that our chances of success are low. And the reason I start here is because when you get brought into opportunities Nci or Ec What phase are they in And how do we handle it accordingly? That's what I'm asking you to consider. Jeeves, this is a great thing for marketing to know. And not just Jeeves because we have Jodie on here with content marketing. As well, what phase are they in? How do we get them to look When do they look? I wish I knew when they were going to look for sales training. Hubspot says for eight thousand dollars a month, they can tell me when they're looking for Sales. So what gets them to look And when they do look what phase are they in. And Hamilton, I don't know if you have any thoughts on this is it pertains to new customers or new prospects starting to look what happens? Is it a calendar thing? Is it a functionality thing? Is it the service thing? But we ask you to think about this as you go about your existing customer and new customer interactions.

Client 9: You know, and and I and I think I think from our standpoint, right? There there's kinda two big reasons people are in the market first switch. Right? Either they're run out of the old one, and they're trying to understand what's out there and that's a pretty broad conversation. Or or the... Or the house is on fire and there something that happened that has really pissed them on Yeah.

Client 9: Which for us is great because then price sort really starts to fall into the background right that So that that's our bet that's our big phase one question is you know, what we used to say granger is if if are we filling up our pool or is there how on fire. And fill like that.

Client 9: We can we can do it either way. But if you call me and you asked for a bucket of water, there's too kind... There's two different kinds of phase ones from our standpoint. Either either our deals up and we're thinking about Hey, Maybe, or something that's really made them upset. We're really pissed him off to the point that now they're in the market and they're they're willing to pay whatever it takes to get away from the old guest.

Client 3: I like that algae. Is the house and fire we filling up the pool. And what creates that sense of urgency to go from one to the other. And Ben, I wish I had a crystal ball where I could do that. Because I have people in the pipeline who told me in May, we gotta do so before the end of the year. We're not doing anything. Right. So I think we're filling up the pool.

Client 8: So Jeeves I don't know if you can see me Jericho at.

Client 8: Like another smaller upset is like a change in ownership either if it's like an acquisition or, like, the owner dealer principles retiring and somebody else is taking over their you know, the son daughter's taking over, that's another time when they tend to look at us They don't wanna use dad's technology. They wanna see what else is out there and make their own way board, Frank Not song my way comes on at that point.

Client 3: An acquisition is We have a customer who's done seven acquisitions in the past like ten months, and it's incredibly disruptive time which creates opportunity, it's terrific. So what gets him look? And are they just looking or are they serious? Right? And if we knew this, exactly We wouldn't be on this call. I would have closed all the deals in my first Thirty five years is selling, and I'd been in French. So I asked you to think about this and now I'd like you to go to page fifteen moly if you would forward for us. Thank you for taking over the driving of the slides. Appreciate that. We're jumping ahead to the Ps map on page fifteen. And if you take a look here, you'll see that there are four columns in the Ps. And the first column says process stages. What are the stages for from lead to revenue from lead to revenue Or is what one of my customers said from Hello? To Po What are those stages and you can see stage one, two, three, four, five, and then stage six is where the business is in, And Josh and Dia this is where you pick it up with the existing customers right, were trying to do some additional selling into those accounts. So here are the stages on the left side. Will there always be five stages in a sales cycle maybe not? You have some transactional things that go on. Could be shorter, You have some enterprise things that go longer, sure of it, we're complex buying. So there are the stages The second column are the tools that we built with you back in February of twenty twenty one We built sales messaging tools to help you go through any of the stages your sales process. And the main tool that we're gonna spend time with today which is the anchor tool, of the Ps is called the discovery map. The discovery map is the anchor tool. We're gonna go through it. We'll talk about how to use it, and then we're gonna practice the use. And I made fun earlier about role play things, and it's not designed to put you under a bright light. It's designed to help you with the key components of the discovery conversation at Bet and I talked about this at length. And that is it no surprises is establishing the value the proceed brings. So there are the tools We have all of those tools in this book We're happy to send you these tools and we will. In Powerpoint, and then we'll send you blank templates We'll send you blank templates for your use. The third column are the selling skills What are the skills that your organization needs and I know you have different functional roles of course as we go through. Ec Nci marketing, But what are the skills that individuals in customer facing roles have to master and execute on at a regular basis, to grow your business. And looking at those skills, which scale gets most of the attention at least from the sales group? Which scale would you say gets most the attention? I'm asking a salesperson do you think through?

Client 3: Drew which scale gets most the attention.

Client 10: I personally think from the pill identifying managing the the system process.

Client 3: Right. Fair enough. Anyone else?

Client 12: I think traditionally, the negotiation and closing gets the most attention.

Client 3: Why do you say that?

Client 12: Because that's where people all automatically jump to typically.

Client 12: Because where the money is.

Client 3: Coin operated josh totally agree. And most of the requests that we get for our services we need more help closing we we gotta close better. We gotta maintain margins and close. I will share with you that that is generally not where the issues lie They manifest at the end, but they're further up. The most difficult thing a salesperson is asked to do is the first skill. Go find new business. Proactive new business development. Thirty five years ago, Pitt those hired me right out of Palo Alto state, They hired me and they said you have to go sell thirty of the smallest product that we offer in ninety days. Or you're fired welcome to the company. Proactive new business development. And the good news is is you have a ton of strong installs. Implementations. One person said, the implementation you did was the best they ever had in any system implementation. So you get a lot of good business in a reactive way. And that's okay. But what we gotta to do to continue to grow the business is take a proactive approach to those existing customers, and, of course, to what ben and the team is gonna do in new customers. But proactive new business development is by far the most difficult thing negotiating and closing gets all the fan fair Bo we go to the next screen, please And I'm not gonna do this today But I'm happy to do this afterwards I can send this out tomorrow, Monday, whatever you like ben we should talk about this. Is stack rank your selling skills. I know not all of you are in sales. I get it. I understand what you're saying. But where do you need the help? And I'm not saying that all eleven people on this call need help in six skill areas. But if it's identifying and managing the prospects decision process and Drew. You said that, And I would agree because a lot of buyers go very quiet when once you given the quote to the proposal. They disappear. It gets what my eighteen year old daughter recall Awkward, until they get back to you with their answer. So we'll talk about ways how to stay in the game why they're making their decision. So Ben, and Larry, I'm happy to send this to team and this is not an Hr exercise But this is really what we coach to later. What area do you need the most help it? And then maybe now's is a good time for you to share with the group what you had shared with me In existing and in new customers, one area you wanna develop further.

Client 9: Certainly... And you know, what one of the areas that that that I think, you know, look I would argue you that everybody always needs help one through six here. Right? I haven't met the perfect salesperson and and everybody's got a gap somewhere in here, but you know, it's as as Jericho and I've been talking a lot about this, you know, I think it's a thing that we do well in the moment. We don't necessarily do a good enough job of on on the back end it's is really time to value two solutions. Right? We do, you know, spent five hours on calls with with Wallace yesterday have point in shooting here's a problem. Here's the solution. Here's the problem here's this solution. And you know, I think both of those customers came away from that. Saying hey these guys probably good fix that this some of the issues we got. I don't know if any of them really have a good understanding and done a good enough job cultivating does that mean to you when we fix it? Right? But here was is the issue, here's what happens when it move forward and so come to the point of putting dollars to down in front of them be able to tie some of that back and they say, oh, whoa, that upfront pretty high guys to be able to come back, I can say, you know, yeah. It's a little bit of money out right now, but we've talked about this right here the things that we pointed to. Right? So here's what you're gonna give me. Here's what we're gonna get back. And and so one of the things that I'm really looking forward to today is is really kinda really on some strategies around tying the the awesome stuff that we've built. To a real business outcome for our customers that means money in their pocket. And And so that... That's what I'm really looking forward to and what I'm gonna be paying close attention to here today because it it's certainly something that I need to work on as well.

Client 3: So that would be developing solutions a value and I'm not saying that you don't. I know you do. I know you create value for your customers. But can we get them to understand And I'm talking now about new opportunity development. Can we get them to understand that they can't just continue to do things the way they're doing it. Do we really fully understand and do that under and if they don't make a change What's the financial impact? And oftentimes something else has to happen, right, Jeeves, you said it? Something else has to happen to get them to look. Because they'll say we've always done it this way, or we're not gonna make a switch or we'll just h along with limited visibility to the data that's happening in forty three different locations. And bet that's the key to getting them to see And if they will help us to monetize the value, And I know it's not easy. We're gonna do it in a role play, skill development exercise where it's all simple. You'll see with the pieces look like, and then you have to take that conversation outside. So not as clear cutting as easy, but the model is in place. And then we go back a slide to fifteen again, melanie. So there are the skills that that we work on in the Ps p we'll practice an exercise that takes us through two and part of three And then I'll show you what the other skill developed exercise looks like to develop the skills. And then there are verifiable outcomes as an opportunity moves through the pipeline. As it moves from to Po, there certain pieces that we can see from progress. If I'm running an organization a sales organization, there's two things I wanna know. What's new? And what moved in the pipeline? So what new things came in and From what was in there, what moved And some movement is out because you lose it other movement is moving forward because you're getting ready to do a demo. Actually show them proof of your capabilities. But we have simple ways to go through and track those verifiable outcomes. And the meeting summary is an email. And we'll show you what that looks like as you go through opportunity development. And then you and I reviewed that the other day, We'll certainly review that again here today with the team and how all members of the team could benefit from meeting summaries, both on the selling side, and on the buying side. We'll talk about specific examples So there it is. Do you think we have enough text on one slide? Should we jam some more stuff in there, Jeeves, have I broken it every Powerpoint role with text and On the left side before you forward bounty on the left side, there are the three phases of the buying process. Phase one for the buyer solution development, Proceed covers that with stages two and three. Phase two of the buying process evaluation, stage four is evaluation. Then phase three for the buyers where they make a commitment that's negotiation. Any questions or comments on this? This is an overview of buying and an overview of how the Ps applies to buy.

Client 7: Can I just make a comment? Course. Thanks. Love the stages. This is you know, I just wanted to echo what you said. I think everybody wants to know what's new and then through these stages, Where are the prospects where the movement then from stage one to stage three to, you know, to stall and why And then Also within the stages, how can marketing help support that movement Right? Not just demos, but we've got specific... you know, departments because it's an enterprise wide. A platform. And so how and where it does marketing I'm a lead nurturing or a Sales process nurturing standpoint, support the sales efforts through their through their efforts, and and and what are the best tools also, an enterprise software world. So wanted to echo what you had said, that's all we really Why is like, what are the new opportunities and then what is the movement of existing opportunities that are going through the the sales process And what is it that marketing can do to help support the advancement or anybody help support the advancement. It's that pretty accurate dennis Jan, Josh I'd like to echo two how to cs help with that right?

Client 12: Because for someone who has just come out of this cycle, they are a true candidate for a referral or for we're basically filling the filling the Ferris wheel. Right? We talk about that. And you know, pipeline is went it's like a ferris wheel's. Once somebody gets off, you put somebody back on and you keep that fair will full and you do that through those referrals and Cs can do a better job. I feel like of being able to help sales build that ferris wheel. And I think it's important for us to use these stages to say, hey, You just came through this kinda like with Jericho J at at Northwest that said, our implementation process was amazing and we were fearful of it, but it was just absolutely amazing it exceeded our expectations. That is a good one to put back onto that to to help sales, get that back that pierce will fill back up as a referral.

Client 7: Was I wasn't trying to keep customer success out of it. Totally agree. Jericho said something to me when we reach chatted about reference and referrals and that is something that you know, needs to be, consistent in all of our existing customer opportunities while we're doing really good with them and they're happy and we are helping them. So references referrals and tying that into our marketing initiatives. Going forward. It's something we're doing. So... Yeah. Good point, Josh.

Client 3: And Josh to what you said very well You know, the way I lay this out, it goes one through five and then the skills follow and If it's ever that way, please call me immediately. If sales or life is ever that way, Let's write a book go to the island we'll collect royalties Your buyer will drag you all over the. Your existing customer will drag you all over place a new opportunity you know, it all bets are off, because you have key players para in a different times They'll throw procurement in at the end just to see a sweat and squeeze on margin. And then in your existing pool of business, Ten, what you had said related to what josh said there's acquisition? There's consolidation there's new key players It was a key player you talked to on Thursday who said it looks good. You called back Tuesday, they said he's no longer with us. Right And my question is in the company or on the planet what happened? You know, I'm curious guy. So It's never this linear. But i went into an office once in Dublin Ireland newly wed with my wife. We had been on our honeymoon and I was a a business trip broader where we hired a car, we didn't rent a car to drive down the left side of the road all the way across Ireland, and I asked the guy, Do I need the garment? Remember at the time it was pretty rude crude It was Gps, but it was not very good. I said, do I need the the Gps he said, If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. So we gotta have something that we all agree upon as those steps when the buyer drags us around and moves this around We need to at least understand where they were when we got to us is why I show you the buying. Cycles, And then where are they in the Ps?

Client 7: So can I just get clarity on that? So it's never gonna be linear from stage one to stage six is what you're saying. It's gonna jump around back forward. And and that's that movement you wanna see. You wanna see it know, just to see. Right? Did it go from four to two or did it go from five back down to discovery y, You know, is that what you're saying Jericho?

Client 3: I'm saying I want to see movement from the buying side. If and on the last call that sales was in, Was it a continuation? Wasn't an advancement? Did we move forward or we just talk about the same shit we talked about in the first three meetings, because that's not movement. And I'm not gonna say to the buyer. You know, we need to move from stage two to four because I a meeting with my manager and gotta get some movement out you. That's not what I'm saying. We need to see where they're going and understand, say there's three key players. We're gonna talk about this next who's involved when they're buying from you. Who are the key players? That they're moving. That they're moving in the same direction. And that procurement doesn't come in at the twelve hour and blow everything up, which is often the strategy from a buying organization. Alright. Fantastic interaction. Let's keep the conversation going. Nobody wants to listen to me for five hours, including me, So when you have examples that you're thinking about if you're thinking about a customer opportunity that you're developing that's something that's relevant here, let's talk about it. Absolutely let's talk about. So melody in from this, proceed sales process map we're gonna jump ahead to stage two In our Netflix series, we're taking you past the most difficult thing sales is asked to do and we're going straight to stage two on page nineteen in your manual go right to discovery. We'll come back to stage one at the end of today. But here we are We fast forwarded the hardest thing to do is find new business boom. You're in front of the customer and we're in stage two discovery. Vanessa, would you read for us what happens in stage two? In discovery, we've defined it all the way through.

Client 1: Stage two discovery, we start with the customer evaluate needs, preliminary budget and timeline. Identify possible suppliers and discuss requirements with vendors.

Client 3: And then what are we doing? What's proceed doing? Keep going.

Client 1: Oh, keep going. Sorry. Activities.

Client 3: Here we go.

Client 1: Yes. Can hide primary business objectives, understand challenges slash position, capabilities, send medium summary, update Crm.

Client 3: Okay. So What's the customer doing? What are we doing? The skills that we're gonna be practicing are discovering and analyzing needs but the word Pb or the acronym, primary business objective, and then developing solutions with value. In order to do that, the tools that we built with you back in i've of twenty twenty one, our industry or market segment Pb Discovery maps and opportunity reviews. So melody, would you take us to page twenty three please? Page twenty three, In your book, And Jeeves, I don't know if you recall, you helped us with the build of this. This was many cycles ago. But the market segment that we looked at was Mac volvo and if I taking a snapshot, overview of that market segment who are the key players on the left side? That you will most likely engage with in opportunity development and what are their business objectives? There's a lot of text on this screen, So I'm gonna give you a minute to read through page twenty three, please. So how does that look as a summary How does that look as a summary? Anyone have questions or comments? Who the key players are? And what are their potential business objectives? Do we know this when we meet with them for the first time? Do we have this information The answer is yes. No or maybe Then it you you you don't know exactly what it looks like for the.

Client 9: Right? But I I think that there... These are pretty much the usual suspects in terms of flavors to start asking around. Right? I don't know which one what are these is getting your out to worst, but there's some flavor of this that that just about everybody's looking at. Right? So the answer is, I guess, maybe.

Client 9: Right? I don't know specifically what it is to you, but but I I know where to start look.

Client 3: Okay. Very good. And you'll notice that each of the Pb have a word in front of them that is a verb. A verb, increase improved, reduce Correct, reduced dwell time approved. So we wanna try and get something in place to get them to share that's measurable. And the three biggest buckets of business objectives or increased revenue reduce costs and reduce risk So the they're the three biggest buckets, but there'd be different words that we can use, as you can see up on this screen right here. And it's important that we get an understanding of what this is from our prospect early in opportunity development because if we don't, Many organizations Some organizations are going to come out and talk about their product or service first And what is the next question out of the buyer's mouth where we talk about ourselves first, Much is it cost?

Client 3: Yes. Absolutely. Rice. Are you ready to have that conversation? Are you the lowest cost provider in town.

Client 8: You don't wanna give them the cost before you've provided the value?

Client 3: And if you do, what are you gonna talk about? The cost. That's what you're gonna talk about. So ideally, in our May for Tv movie, We're gonna talk about the Pd first. But what do customers or prospects call in and ask you for. When they call in what do they ask for? Did they say I wanna improve my access to data? What do they generally call in talking about. Gary, what are they call it talking about?

Client 5: They're gonna I would think they would mention the problem they need or or they just need a product if they So they will talk about things other than the Pb o.

Client 3: And I know your a product manager. They'll talk about something they heard about your functionality or the problem that they have. And that makes sense because something happened. Right? What happened in their world to get them from not looking to look We understand that? But we've got it at some point early in that conversation, get the two the Pd l. We gotta get them to it. Melody, will go back one page, please to page twenty two There's a few different ways to get a Pd shared early opportunity development new account existing account. Because if it's an existing account with a new key player, we wanna know what their Pv is. Or if it's an existing account with the same key player Do we know what their Pd is for next year? Because you've been servicing them for two years? We wanna sell them more stuff. Do we know what's important to them in twenty twenty three? So we can ask them what their Pb is. And I know some of this is very elementary for you. I get it. We can ask them the questions on the left side here. The first column, what are you hoping to accomplish? What prompted your inquiry what are the consequences of not changing? Do you know what? Most salespeople wanna know in that first conversation Hamilton? You know what most salespeople like me wanna know?

Client 9: What's gonna thank you By.

Client 3: Are you gonna buy from me? That's what I wanna know. We've been talking for six minutes and eight seconds that I wanna know, are you gonna buy from me? And if they say yes. I wanna know when are you gonna buy for me? Because I have to get my boss this forecast, and I wanted to be right. I'm really busy. I got these teenagers and this dog there's lot going on. Are you gonna buy for me it's a tough question to ask. So we're trying to get them to share with us what they are hoping to accomplish. And some of your existing customers ben. I love that quote you put on Linkedin. Yes, and I'm gonna pop it up after the break. By the way, our break is in one hour. At ten o'clock right around ten o'clock. I hope I love that quote that you sent over because they talk about Ups. They talk about the business objectives you help them to reach. So early in opportunity development even at the trade show when they come up to the booth, And your products on display, Let's try and get them into Pv conversations. The second way to do it is if you have a menu of Pb, And Jeeves, maybe here is something for us to develop further and or Jody, contact marketing manager, menus of Pb, mah, we go back to twenty three and gary too.

Client 8: Yeah. I think that's something that we definitely want.

Client 3: Yep.

Client 8: Sorry did right. One of those tools we wanted to get move forward last February that kinda fell off.

Client 3: So... So here it is. Right? And you know what these are. You as a company know what these are, because you have people in the different market segments, with titles and they've told you what you've helped him to do. And this is not a difficult exercise. This is one we built Oem for Mac. So like, do can I ask a question around this, which is great because you were talking and Jeeves about it.

Client 7: you know, we're we're doing a campaign right now for all of twenty twenty three, which is why pros. Why did you make the decision? And I would think that you can grab a lot of these Pb you know, and tie that to the messaging if that makes sense, because we're we're you know, it's not just because we're great people. They chose us. Right? It's because of certain things. And if we have some key points around that tying that in when we're extracting quotes from our customers. For this campaign because they let us basically say we can develop. Pretty much any type of quote we want. So it could be a little bit more, I guess specific. Does that make sense Jeeves, are you tracking? I know you're tracking, but You know what I mean? That was a question, Jim.

Client 8: Yeah. I think this... If I'm looking at the menu section on page two, I think that's slightly different. Like i says some of the business objectives i've encountered with speaking with others of your title are So it's more less like, success quotes but more... This was the objectives and this is how we've helped people. So I think taking the background of what led them to give that quote is what we want for there, but not maybe using a specific quote.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 7: And jed. What I would say. Basically... Sorry, Jericho. That's what I was saying. Like, we might be not be doing the right thing with this the quotes. In the sense of how we gotta look at that that's only gonna help prospects it's gonna only help the the nurturing from stages you know, are we touching on the things that help them make the decision. I guess what's the point versus where we're going with the y can't So we have a jody everybody, we gotta kinda make sure we're we're tracking on that.

Client 3: Melanie, please go back to twenty two, Jeeves because this isn't enough in my and we're just starting a conversation. With what you saw on twenty three. But ultimately, what we wanna do is get to twenty twenty two column three, the success story. And we have that too. Yep after clubs come in.

Client 3: Yes. In thirty four seconds that paints the whole picture. This just as the first ten to thirteen seconds of the conversation. So we will we'll pull that through and I'll show that to you I think that's after the break. Yes. After to the break. But we're early we just want those key players to say set instead of saying Vanessa, send me a quote, We want them to tell us What's the business objective that's tied to the quote? Because the Department of Sales prevention says send me a quote. Right? The Department of Sales Prevention sends Rf or Rfp and says, send us the information and then we'll let you know. When White smoke goes up the Chimney, we have elected a leader send me the quote. And Then vanessa, you're gonna you have a new policy in your office that you're not just send quotes anymore. Right?

Client 1: I I never usually do. I usually get them to tell me what their problems are. So never have a problem to have to say now.

Client 3: Excellent. Good. We'll get them to talk. That's what we what. So there's an example On twenty three, is a one market segment and the menu of Pb When they call in, Gary, they call in talking about a product or a challenge, how do we turn that into what they're hoping to accomplish what's important to them? Two ways to do it here we'll talk about the success story after the break. Alright So Melody, please take us to page twenty four briefly. Page twenty four is an overview of an opportunity review You said to us opportunities review. Thank you for those who sent them in. Here's an example of one that we built for the workshop. And this is who you're gonna be calling on. You're going be called on n and k trucks. And they're Mag volvo Oem, here's some particular in information about them on the top box And then here are the key players and their Pb pbs. So in our Netflix movie, we'd filled this in, and you're gonna go in and start talking to them Steven Str bird Ka leonard and Marshall. And all of those names came from Larry Kepler I want you to know what do those three key players all haven't got.

Client 11: Palo Alto Legends?

Client 3: Not Palo Alto, Dave you gotta be more specific.

Client 10: I'm sorry.

Client 11: Palo Alto state?

Client 10: Clear.

Client 3: Thank you. Yes. Yes. Yes. And, Larry, I don't have a Palo Alto state hat. So if you're still looking for a Christmas gift for me, Thanks, Jericho.

Client 3: In any of the... Here are the three key players, And here are their Pb. And when we go into our role play you're gonna have to dig for that a bit. You're going be calling on Steven Str bird. He may give you information he may not. And when you did your opportunity review, Couple things to consider Is it a business objective under the Pb o or did you put a capability in there or a solution. And do we thoroughly under and their current challenges with financial impact. And then when we offer our capabilities, do we know what value they'll This is what Ben said, we can improve upon. Right? And welcome to the human race, there's always something we can prove upon but this is what we're looking to do. And we're not looking for this to be perfect when you send it in. It really is It's really perfect when we go to close the business. We try and get as much information as we can. And think about when we get these right how you can share this from Ec to turn into Ncr. And from marketing to come in and really position proceed successfully. Okay. Alright. So melanie, would you jump us ahead, please? To page twenty seven. To page twenty seven, This is the core tool in the Ps. This is the anchor tool. This is foundational to all opportunity development whether it's newer or existing, and how we understand The customer prospect using our capabilities to generate value. It's called the discovery map. It's the discovery map and there are three parts to the discovery map. And the first one we've been talking about for a bit here. Is understanding their business objective number one. The second thing will do on the Discovery map, Jeeves, you said this is we're going to diagnose their challenges. What is going on in their world today that inhibits them from reaching their business objective. And if they don't make a change, what's the impact? And then the third leg of the stool Discovery map is where you position your capabilities. that address challenges and helped them to reach their business objective. So in the role play like we did before, we're gonna to go one two three. How many of you learned how to drive an automobile a manual vehicle. Manual anyone? That's good. There's a couple out there me too. It was my brother's volkswagen bug, And I would push in the clutch was fifteen and a half years old and my mother was any gear will do. As long as it's not reversed, Any gear will do But ideally, we go one two three. So I'm gonna ask you when we do the skill development exercise. Please go one two three. And will, there'll be any of you out there when the customer talks about their business objective challenge that you're gonna just have to go talk about proceed and tell them about how wonderful we are in our system. Will you be able to slow that down? And make sure we thoroughly do wanted to before we talk about ourselves, because oftentimes that's what sees salespeople do. So what says they have a problem. And they're given the answer. And what does that do to the perceived value of the solution when we give the answer too quickly. Correct, Josh. It decreases the perceived value. Who is the diagnosis for? Who is a thorough understanding of the Pb o and the challenges for? Who who benefits from a thorough understanding of that. Who's it really for Yeah all the above.

Client 12: For the customer it allows them to sell themselves for you it tells you exactly what you have to do to close it.

Client 3: And if there's not enough in there, josh, around the challenges that they're facing and You know, they're sleeping on a bed nails. So like, oh, it's not that bad. I can Jam a pillow in here and We'll just hop along with the system that we've had and I don't need visibility into all our rules and mentality like that. How much time are we gonna spend chasing it? And I work with a lot of salespeople and others in we're facing roles and Who knows when you're working on a big opportunity? Who knows when you're working on a big opportunity. Would you definitely know who else knows? Hamilton it Who else knows? Larry knows Who else knows The customer knows for sure when you're working on a big opportunity, Does your significant other know when you're working on a big opportunity?

Client 9: My experience just about everybody knows.

Client 3: Everybody knows. And is the dog waiting on the porch because you went out on a big call and you come back and they're like How the call go? And when a seller goes out on a big call, their manager news they went The manager says to the rep But vanessa how did the call go And what do you say? Great. Great. Fantastic. They like the pod too. We swapped the recipe for chicken tortilla soup. Was amazing. It Who cares? What's their business objective? And what challenges are they facing before we spend time chasing them. When you're working on a big opportunity, it's exciting. I love. I love sims.

Client 9: To to to Jericho... And I I don't mean interrupt you here and and i sorry if you're gonna get to this year, but Could you could you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the differentiation or sort of how box one and box two relate to each other here. Because gonna sort of look to me right now, like too tucson... As of the of of the same coin or or... you know, before we jump into the the exercise here. Yeah.

Client 9: I I I certainly kinda know how I think about the difference between one and two, but but maybe years you think about this, what what's what's that look like?

Client 3: They're selling programs out there Hamilton that focus on the pain They say you gotta go in sandler says you gotta diagnose the pain.

Client 3: And I disagree. What you have to do is you have to under and the challenges that the customer facing today. But in order to get them to move, you gotta under stand where they wanna be. What does the goal... Some selling programs customer centric selling? Calls it the goal we called the Pd o. And it is the flip side of the same coin. But I gotta know where they wanna go and what's inhibiting them from getting there before I could say, we have the solution. We can help you do that. And seasoned salespeople will hear that there's a challenge and they won't diagnose it they'll say fix it. And if you jump in too quickly to save somebody who's drowning what might happen, You gotta get created account.

Client 3: You agree. That is a great answer who said that That group. Drew, that's a great answer You create another challenge. It's called bad forecasting. Because you told them how you would fix it Before you thoroughly understood If they don't fix it, what's gonna happen? And what they do, what does that mean to their organization better? Because low level technical users will tell you, I can't get data, the date crap gotta a look all day for it. But then you go to the Cfo And he's not concerned about the technical aspects. He's concerned about reports Right? And how do I get visibility into what's going on out there? And if I don't understand those two pieces before I give the solution, It deletes the value. And it generally becomes a loss or you lose to n d i No decision Incorporated. We'll just stick with what we got. It's not that bad. I am not concerned about your ability to talk about yourself, number three. You just do it too soon and too often, and you do demos that aren't qualified. So now We gotta make sure we understand the Pd o and the challenges of the key players. And if there's only one key player I gotta get this right By the functional role, who should it be? Who should it be? The decision maker? And do we get them before we do the demo. Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. I get it. Okay. Did I answer that or was I on the Soap box too long please.

Client 9: Well so so sort of what I'm what I'm hearing here is is that, you know, that that the the Pb o is around you know, I I I I think so. Right? So so, you know, when when we're talk about the number number two. Right? What we're really looking at is how does the... Or how does the Pb sort of manifest off in real life. What is that what does that look like right now? Why is the Ppo o the Pb? When you call and you tell me I wanna do x y, and z. Well, there has to be a reason why you wanna do x y and z. Right? So Yep. But what what what is it? What does it look like in real life how do we know that our Pb o is really the Pb o?

Client 9: Because... Yeah. I think you know, fairly often customers call us out and they think my you know, I've I've got one problem with what it turns out is is another what I wanna do, I think looks like this, but it turns out, it really looks like that.

Client 3: And so Think like that's just it's just a it's a an interesting differentiating point here is that, you know, sometimes people don't actually know what they wanna because they they don't know what else is is this could be done.

Client 9: But, you know, that that understanding of the you know, that the that that our challenges is you know, how is that Pb manifesting itself in real life Right that. The the reason why the Ppo o is the Ppi i or Pb comes in box number. Number two. And and and if we if we can't talk about how we got to the Pb becoming the Pb o Well, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree here and we we come back and and understand what it is that we're really hoping to achieve.

Client 3: Fantastic. So there'll be two ways that will make sure that we got that right We're gonna ask them And then we're gonna send it a summary. And and that it will buyers mislead sellers Absolutely. Of course, they will. They wanna get a quote from you so they can beat the crap out of their incumbent vendor or whatever reason. Right? And you're smiling and I know that smile of joy and pain on the flip side when they take you down the P path first seven month sales cycle, leave you hanging at six months, twenty eight days. We're gonna ask them, did we get this right? And then we're gonna send them the meeting summary that says we agreed to this can we move the opportunity forward? Would there ever be some miscommunication of course oftentimes key players in the same organizations aren't working on the same Pb o. Or they don't know what they're working on. The the decision maker says to a influencer go get three quotes, and I don't wanna talk to a salesperson. I don't like salespeople. I don't like people. Just get me three quotes. And are we gonna pursue that? And sometimes organizations pursue it because it's big. So let's go through we're gonna go through the role play and we're gonna verbally confirm what we heard and then we're gonna write it I'm gonna come back and ask you I hear what you're saying. Let's get clarity on this. That's a great point.

Client 12: I do think it's important to to ask throughout the sales cycle if your primary business objectives changed. Right? Because there's been many times on in our case where when they hear that other people are looking internally at a solution. More people throw in their hat into what they need. And so constantly making sure that you're renewing and and you know, confirming what the primary business objectives are is important. At least has been on the on the customer side, Was in Paris two weeks ago for a global opportunity.

Client 3: We work with North America Josh and the French leader a woman who's training her own team pulled me aside after a meeting of ten people said I don't wanna train it. I want... I'm I'm too busy. I have too much going on. Please put that in the quote. So I did. And then the lady that runs the organization looked at this and goes. Not doing that. We're not gonna do that. So I said, would you write an back to Geraldine dean to let her know. Sorry. I'm happy to do it for them. But there there's an example. So we're gonna go through this exercise and make sure that we confirm what we heard and Hamilton in the field, I hear what you're saying brother Is this clear and do we have an understanding of this before we send him the quote? And you said something else? They don't know what they need, but they know what they know they need it. They don't know specifically what they need, but they know it they're not getting there today. So we gotta help them to understand if they don't continue to get what's there today What's the impact? Alright. So we're talking about Pe pbs. We're talking about the discovery map We're gonna walk through what the build of that discovery map looks like and then Bali and I are going damage straight what that conversation sounds like for you. We're gonna model the role play, you'll see it here what it sounds like. Before we break you into groups and ask you to do that practice. But melanie, if you go to the next page, please. So once we get it under standing of what their Pd is, we're gonna ask for it ask some questions. Tell me more about your desire to have increased visibility do you measure it? What's your current measurement? So on and so forth next stage, please melody. And beneath the surface of the primary business objective on page twenty nine are the challenges. What are the challenges that are inhibiting them from reaching that Pd o? Next page, please? In order to understand the challenges and Bet this is something you took a look at and said, we could refine this Understanding the challenges we're gonna ask three different types of questions. I know that you ask questions. I know the proceed asked questions about how people are running their business today. But they'll be three different types of questions that will ask we'll answered said open ended question, Directed questions and then an impact question. What's the open ended question How can you define the open ended question? How do you define it?

Client 9: Question can't be answered. Yes or no.

Client 3: And what's it designed to do? It's designed to get them to talk? So we're gonna ask good open any questions to get them to talk about what's going on today. Will then ask directed questions. Melody, please go to the next page. Direct questions are designed to measure How much How often Something is happening. And drew, I see you're jumping off for your call. Good luck. Drew, we're gonna d debrief you when you come back on this call. We're gonna say how to go you're gonna say great. Okay? Fantastic.

Client 3: So we're gonna ask open ended questions. Directed questions and then impacted questions. And if there isn't enough Velocity here to get them to make a change Are they gonna switch? You know it's not that bad, lying on the better nails type of thing. So do we, and do they understand if they don't make a change Is there an impact financial and otherwise? Because it could be an emotional impact. It could be morale. Could be the people are frustrated can't get the job done. So we're gonna go through and ask those types of questions. And somebody said this earlier, Jeeves, I think it was you Go to the next slide, please. Because if you do this in medicine, if you offer a prescription before diagnosis it's called malpractice. Didn't you say that?

Client 8: Think Vanessa gets credit for that.

Client 3: I think V vanessa a good job.

Client 1: Thank you.

Client 3: And V vanessa what's it called in sales? If you offer a prescription before diagnosis, Stupid.

Client 1: I don't you know, you're just...

Client 1: You're cutting off your nose despite your face at that point. Like, you're just You're not getting that you're not not doing. You're not gonna get a sales your probability goes down anyways.

Client 3: It might be called stupid, I think it's kinda harsh. Fair enough, it might be called bad forecasting.

Client 1: Okay. That that's right. There it is.

Client 3: We think we think this one is going to close because they like the pod and the chicken tortilla tier soup and all those other things. That are totally irrelevant. So we will fully diagnose this Before we come in and talk about us, We're gonna do that before we talk about us. But next slide, please, page thirty three Mon Now we are gonna talk about proceed. About your products and services. But we're gonna do it in a different way. We're not gonna tell them what they need. We're going to ask them If they had the capability that proceed offers if they had that capability then would it be able to address the challenge that they're facing? And if it was able to address the challenge that they're facing, What value could they recognize? And when we do it the role play, everything's gonna happen beautifully. It's gonna go hand and glove fit perfectly and then in reality, you'll go to the field and you might not get that easy of a ride. Right? But what we're hoping happens here But the questions that you're asking in the challenges and how you position the capabilities that that person you're speaking to, says well, they get it. They understand our business and they understand how we could help them to improve. So again, in the model that Melanie and I do, it's all gonna flow just smoothly but in reality when you're in the field, You might have to do some additional digging here to get to that point. Okay Any questions or comments on the layout of the discovery map. Melody go to the next page there, thirty four lays out the if you the capability will position in the form of a question if you had this capability then, What benefit could you recognize? How would the challenge be improved? We don't wanna to tell them what to do. We wanna ask them. And this is early. Right? This is early to development. This is Nci. It's new, It's not the existing customer who understands how we do things for them. We're taking it back to the very beginning on a brand new opportunity. And Ben Franklin says people are best convinced by reasons they themselves discover. Have you recently tried to tell somebody what to do? I'm thinking about teenagers at this point or young adults? Because I have two of them. Not always an easy thing to do. And how we position those capabilities is specific to the challenges that they're facing. Alright. So at this point, melanie and I are gonna go through and role play this for you. If you please go to page thirty nine, in your manual? And Mah, I think we should also send to the to the individuals on the team Melanie, and I are gonna model this for you and show you what it looks like. And then we're gonna break you out into groups to do this And when we do that, Those of you who in sales will definitely be the seller. But when we go out to the group the first time m me, and I will be the buyer But then we're gonna have some of u be the buyer. Some of you will play the role of the buyer. And we're gonna give you the answers that we want you to use in the conversation with the person who's doing the selling. There goes josh Smith, jumping on through Good luck josh. Anxious to hear what you have to report back So Melanie, Would you at this point send out that coaches guide with the answers? And that will come through on your email so we'll just take a quick break here for a minute. Don't go anywhere. Gonna go in a twenty minute break at ten o'clock or one o'clock wherever you're located. But Melanie, would you send them that or did you already send that to them?

Client 6: We'll do it right now.

Client 3: Okay. Thank you Any questions or comments as we get into our discovery map Role play?

Client 9: Know I guess the the only big one, right is that We've all done these before. These are Awkward, Silly goofy, It's no shame here. Right? And and writes it forward it. This is gonna make us all better and the more we put it to it the tomorrow we get out of it. So your shaving in the closet for a little bit, and let's... We'll we'll we'll get after because these are there's a lot game from these.

Client 1: I've always wanted to be an actress. So I'm just gonna pretend them on Broadway.

Client 6: I just sent it Okay.

Client 3: Very good. So we sent that out to you, and we're happy to walk you through the use of that before we go out to the breakout rooms. Then mah, I'm looking at nine thirty two You and I go for about ten minutes And then what I'm saying is the break is at ten Let's do a democratic vote. Do we wanna to do the role play before the break that would push it to about ten fifty or do we wanna wait and do it after the break. Does anybody feel strongly one way or another So we need about thirty minutes for the role play. Anybody schedule a call at ten o'clock, I don't wanna mess you up because I did say that on the memo.

Client 9: You know what what what if it if just from the standpoint that happened Josh, and drew back here far that might I might give them some or what if we if we did break first and then a good idea exercise after.

Client 3: Thank you. Thinking and man on the call here. Yeah. Let's see if we can get them back in. And I I generally mentioned this at the end, but we have two people out for this role play. Hopefully, they'll come back then it. Thank you for the idea. Anything that we cover here today, will be given to you in access to an online learning portal. Each of these segments that we go through with the stages, or in an online learning portal in fifteen minute reinforcements. So you can go through the entire workshop which is two and a half day in six fifteen minute reinforcement. It's ninety minutes. So you'll get access to that as well. Alright. So that's part of the continuous training and development and working through some of those awkward bumps that you talked about that it for sure. Alright. Super moly. Are you ready?

Client 6: Yeah.

Client 3: Who do you think will be the buyer and who will be the seller of this role play? Do you thinking? Any guesses out there? So melanie, you are It says in the book, you're Harvey, Kite, but that's Typo, Your Stephen Str berg. Your your. You're a pitcher for the Washington Nationals.

Client 3: And amazing career. And you're the Cfo. That I'm calling on on page thirty nine. Alright?

Client 3: Go ahead put it up so they can follow along. It's on page thirty nine in your book. And Melanie has the coaches guide with has the answers that we just sent to you we'll talk about how you can use that when we get out to your rooms. Melanie and I will be with you in your rooms to walk you through this. Okay? Alright, Melody. So if you would screen share, please, And I've gone through and set that appointment with bo So we're into a conversation. And I say melanie, thanks for showing me around your facility Course in February twenty one, It was a virtual tour. Found it very interesting to observe some of the projects you have going on and meet some of your team.

Client 6: Thank you so So when you called, you asked me to come in and talk to you about proceed?

Client 3: Before I do that, I would like to understand what you're hoping to accomplish by looking at our products and services. What's the business objective? That you're focusing on.

Client 6: I have all sorts of initiatives for the new year.

Client 3: All sorts of initiatives as well, some of the objectives that I've heard from other Cfo recently Are to reduce cost? To increase service, or to improve efficiencies and specifically some to improve the data access that they have and the accuracy, of that data. Are any of these worth discussing Improving data access and increasing accuracy of financial data that is worth discussing Very good.

Client 3: So if you'd scroll to the next page, page thirty in your book, I beg you're pardon. Page forty. So here's page forty at the top it says job title function is Cfo, and she wants to improve data access and increase accuracy Melody, what are some of the challenges that you face when it comes to productivity and relying on that financial data.

Client 6: There's no actionable data for Tommy decision making.

Client 3: So you see challenge one right there team, no act data for timely decision making and then challenge two is down in the middle of the page The amount of time it takes to create reports manually. So Monty For now, let's talk about that item number one, you have no actionable data for timely decision making. What's happening currently to keep you from getting that data in a timely fashion.

Client 6: It's just difficult to measure the the date the data is difficult to measure Yep.

Client 3: And why don't you have visibility to the data you're looking for.

Client 6: It's just not built out.

Client 3: So you don't have the functionality. Do you have daily reports?

Client 6: Yes and where are they run?

Client 6: In the evening.

Client 3: Each evening their run. And what other challenges does this cause that you have them in the evening with limited visibility.

Client 6: We're not able to seeing any trends.

Client 3: Does this cause problems with visibility into your service process, Yes, it does.

Client 3: And how specifically is that impacted?

Client 6: Well, repair orders are staying longer than this terry, and it's causing delays and realized revenue.

Client 3: So repair orders are delayed and slow down on your recognized revenue. How many of repair orders are delayed per location? You.

Client 6: Probably about fifteen a month.

Client 3: Fifteen per month. And what's the average cost of a repair order?

Client 6: Fifteen thousand dollars Fifteen k.

Client 3: And what's the number of locations that you have Fifteen, Fifteen seems to be the number.

Client 3: There's fifteen per month, and the average cost of repair is fifteen thousand dollars at fifteen locations. Say correct?

Client 6: That's correct.

Client 3: And what is the percentage cost of the delay?

Client 6: Oh, probably about one percent.

Client 3: So about one percent So if we added all those pieces up, the number of repair orders delayed at fifteen per month fifteen thousand dollars per repair order fifteen locations and one percent is the cost delay What do you come up with there is that total cost?

Client 6: Thirty three thousand and seven hundred and fifty dollars per month. Sorry. Thirty three thousand to seven hundred and fifty.

Client 3: Per month. Per month per month. So I'm just gonna go down now to the bottom of the page and summarize what I heard. So it's summary, I'm gonna to skip challenge too for now we're just gonna do one. So, Melanie or Stephen, what you would share with me is you have limited visibility into the data that you need from your locations that when reports are run they're run the evenings, And this is creating some Limits as it pertains to what's going on in your service process says There's fifteen locations that you have The average cost of repair is fifteen thousand dollars and it's a one percent cost of delay Which equates to you said thirty three thousand dollars Per month. Is that correct?

Client 6: Yes.

Client 3: So do I have a good understanding of that situation?

Client 6: I think you do.

Client 3: So I'm coming to the upper right part and I'm gonna ask Steven, what capabilities have you considered to address these issues Have you been looking at any solutions at this point?

Client 6: Yeah. We have.

Client 3: Well, may I share some ideas with you?

Client 6: Sure.

Client 3: Melanie, if you could see your repair orders, and the supporting transactional detail in real time Then could you see the trends and make decisions for corrective action? Implement process to reduce the work in progress in a timely manner Could you do that?

Client 6: Yeah I think so And if you were able to do that, how much of that thirty three thousand dollars per month do you think you could realize by not pushing all?

Client 3: To a later date two hundred or fifty percent probably.

Client 3: You think you could cut that in half.

Client 6: Yeah. I think so k Alright.

Client 3: Now I'm gonna come down to the bottom of the page, and I'm gonna confirm what I heard the value. So melanie with the perceived capabilities we've discussed you shared that there may be a benefit in there to cut that cost in half. In terms of the delays the service orders in fifteen year locations. Is that correct?

Client 3: Melody, did you hear me?

Client 6: Yeah.

Client 3: Okay. There's some background noise there. Very good, so you could you feel like you could cut that in half. I know that you're also having challenges in the amount of time... takes to create reports manually but we're out of time at this point. So when we come back perhaps we could talk about that topic.

Client 6: Okay.

Client 3: Alright. So let's go to page forty one. And we're gonna close out the call. So, Melanie, do you see enough value for us to continue our dialogue around improving your data access and the quality of that financial data, I do What budget has been assigned to this project?

Client 6: It hasn't been really finalized yet. So it's negotiable Good And who else in your organization should be involved in our discussions?

Client 6: Oh probably the Ceo and the Vp of product.

Client 3: Assuming we get into an agreement to proceed, What would be your timeline for an implementation?

Client 6: Say about three months. Three months.

Client 3: So q one of twenty twenty three. Very good. Well, thank you for your time. Like to take this information back to my office and send you a summary of our conversation an email. Could we set up a time to review that? And then arrange meetings with your other key players.

Client 6: Here that sounds great.

Client 3: What time works for you? Next week I'll open on a Wednesday about ten Am.

Client 3: Very good. I'll send you that meeting invite for Wednesday at ten Am. And ask for access to your Ceo of that Vp of product, and I'll get you the summary in advance well.

Client 6: Right Very good.

Client 3: Thank you for your time melanie. I appreciate it.

Client 6: Thank you. Looking forward to seeing it.

Client 3: Okay? Alright. So that concludes our Role play demonstration, what observations did you have?

Client 2: I have a question. I know this was just a really condensed example, but feel like, I blinked and I missed like, at what portion of that conversation would have been demonstration of the capability. Mean, I know you were just sort of fast tracking over it. Like, hey, let's pretend we just demonstrated this. So when you do the summary, are you going to re summarize the capability as part of, hey, this is the problem I heard. This is the solution we offer And this is how we're gonna get you to those primary this Pd that you're after, it it i maybe I just making it more complicated, but I'm just trying to envision where where the the meat of the demonstration would have happened in that you talking about a product demo?

Client 2: I'm talking about the salute the capability, the protein capability that we would have demonstrated as proof of meeting solving those challenges to meet the Pd.

Client 3: Yeah. We're not there yet not even close.

Client 3: Yeah. No. We don't wanna do that. I don't wanna show them the answer. I wanna ask then? If they had the answer, how would that impact the challenge? And then what value did they say? But I'm not I don't wanna talk about it demo until I speak to the other key players and get agreement.

Client 2: Okay. So can I i'm just trying to think of some of our more standoff folks. Right? Like, I feel like Some of them may have may perceive that dialogue of that conversation as you literally just have me on the phone to restate to me what I already know. Like, what what did I get out of? That meeting Mh.

Client 3: Yep So You have existing customers that you're calling on right, Diana and You know them. And you know their business and they're going to take a look at some other capabilities solution, whatever you wanna call it that you offer. Correct?

Client 2: For existing customers right now, they're coming to us. So they're coming to us saying, I saw a newsletter announcement or, hey, proceeds proceed must have a signature capture capability. Right? Like, do you have one So so, yeah. We're... Yes. We're talking to this customers who are either at trying to solve a particular challenge or heard about a particular feature There are cases and this is gonna be more of the Cs team who's not on here right now. There's gonna definitely cases where they're talking to an existing pest to just do a relationship building call and they're looking at their total solutions set that they're using and they're going to introduce a solution that the customer we're not already taking advantage of.

Client 3: Yes. And when they introduced the solution melanie, will you go back please to page twenty seven, And you should be able to just punch in two seven. I don't know if your machine will do that. But Dia had to please go back to twenty seven. And this is what Drew said. When they call in? They ask about functionality or they tell you they have a challenge. So they called it and they What part of the discovery matt did they reference? To you when they called in.

Client 2: Well, what based on what you just said it would be the second box.

Client 3: Didn't you say that they ask for signal was the name of the function signal?

Client 2: signature capture, signature capture.

Client 3: Which is a feature that you offer. Correct? Correct. So they talked about three Right.

Client 2: But sorry. I thought you just said they called in with a challenge. I heard the word challenge. But yes. If they... If they said I'm interested in capture. I read about it in your newsletter. Yeah. They're talking about number three there.

Client 3: Or what challenge would they face if they didn't have signature capture?

Client 9: Why did you call about with your capture?

Client 2: What did you call Yeah. They're saying we have too much paper. In the... Two I miss spoke what I said challenge, I should said capability But they're saying we have too much of paper.

Client 3: They've told you three and two.

Client 2: they don't usually tell us too. They usually say heard about signature capture.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 2: And tell me more about it.

Client 3: Fantastic, I'd love to tell you more about signature capture. Can you share with me how you're doing that today? And they're not doing it.

Client 2: Right?

Client 3: Right. We're... We don't like they can't do it. So without the ability to capture signature, what's going on... You know, I'd be happy to tell you about Dia. But what I wanna do is I wanna give you specific recommendations on how you can use it. So can you share with me what's happening today in the absence of that function? So I can be specific the customer manually signing a piece of paper and then somebody in our accounting office is getting it for our record retention Okay.

Client 3: And how often is that happening Daily having daily And then what does that mean?

Client 3: How many signatures are you capturing in that manual way?

Client 2: A hundred and fifty a day.

Client 3: Great. Hundred fifty a day times twenty business days, So we have three thousand signatures that you're capturing manually. Who else lies on that data?

Client 2: At everybody. I mean, it's our digital... It's our big digital record of the transaction.

Client 3: Right. And on a scale of one to ten, how well is that going for you doing at manual it's not.

Client 2: That's why I'm calling because I know I want signature capture.

Client 3: Okay. So who else is impacted by that and antiquated way of capturing the signature.

Client 2: Everybody our customers aren't happy with us that they can't get an electric elect electronic to copy. We have too much paper and we're paying people to scan pieces of paper.

Client 3: Got it. And what's the impact on their operations when that's happening. On your operation or the other departments.

Client 2: Frustration and just unnecessary resources.

Client 3: Have you been able to monetize that?

Client 2: No We have some other customers who had a similar situation to that, that when we get to the point and we'll show you how our signature capture works we'll also talk to you about the things that they were able to do.

Client 3: And if you can get that refined it really going well. What would that mean to your team.

Client 3: It would be that the people who are spending the time scanning could do other things in the business, our customers could get copies of their electronic documents faster, and we would have electronic document retention is instead of paper retention that's taking up space and storage and all of that.

Client 3: And how access And if you can do all three or four of those things, what does that mean to your company probably reduce cost and some happier customers.

Client 3: Diana thank you for doing this impromptu two role play with me. We just walked perfectly through parts wanted to, and I didn't tell you shit about three because I don't know what signature captured for.

Client 2: But, again, I feel like if I was... It I don't I didn't don't know that I'm trying a little bit of devil's advocate. I don't know I got anything out of that if I already knew I was coming to you wanting signature cap and I was hoping you... I already know at least I think I know. I already know Signature captures an industry standard. Like, it's kind of like a well, duh don't you have it. Everybody's got it. Every retail business to go and you you sign electronically, I know we need to get up to speed in our dealership. So I don't need to be sold on needing that solution. What I actually wanna see is is proceeds solution is is my vision of what I believe to know about signature capture out in the real world out in the wild. Does that match to what proceeds solution is So I really want to see and know, like, I know it's gonna save me money. I know it's gonna make customers happy. I know signature capture results in an elect Electronics signed document. What I don't know is how seamless proceeds version is I don't know is how easy it is to use k.

Client 3: Okay. So then instead of those open directed and impact questions I asked you, and somebody says cut to the chase What value could you recognize from using signature capture? I'm I'm I'm going.

Client 2: I've I'm I'm I'm tracking with you. So it's it's integrated right with the Dms, so it's right within... Well, I'm getting into abilities. But I'm I would say it's because it's integrated, it's right within the existing work flow. So it's simple to No extra steps needed. There's no extra I don't know. I lost my train a thought there Can you your question?

Client 3: What value would you recognize in using Signature capture?

Client 9: You you as the customer Us proceeds.

Client 3: No you, Dean as the customer. On. What value you you say you know all about signature capture and how it impacts, your business and me asking you questions didn't generate any further value. So I'm just gonna say value you recognize from using Signature capture.

Client 2: Value could I recognize...

Client 3: Would that mean to your team?

Client 2: Trying to think of how I would answer that differently from what I already answered. So maybe I'll just maybe I'll restate some of it. So the value would be our Our team could more easily recall a customer's reprint when they requested. Our office admin wouldn't need to keep box boxes of paper in a closet, it would be all electric and they can pull it up on their computer when in mary. Mh.

Client 3: And you you... Yeah. I I I see right where you're going. You're talking about customer satisfaction talking about the cost of a full time equivalent doing something putting boxes in storage whatever. Right? So I'd ask them questions around what do you think it would be terms of an improvement in your customer satisfaction, And you said to me earlier that that full time equivalent could be doing something else, could they do Could they get another project done? Instead of doing that manual process?

Client 2: Most likely, I mean, we we would make a decision whether they did something else or whether it just was an opportunity for us to maybe eliminate a purely administrative role And and what does that person cause full time equivalent to the organization.

Client 2: Yeah. They're probably maybe twenty bucks an hour.

Client 3: K? So that's forty thousand dollars a year. You just told me there's forty thousand dollars year of value having signature capture. How much to say... And now we're out of role play, How much to signature capture cost.

Client 2: I don't know. Josh would no Josh, How much l?

Client 9: It it's it it it would be seventy five bucks a branch per month.

Client 3: And how many branches are we talking about in this opportunity?

Client 2: Our average customer base is ten.

Client 3: So it's nothing. Just saved them forty thousand dollars. And we're asking them for seventy five hundred bucks.

Client 2: Right. Which... You know, again, I think they know it would save them twenty forty thousand dollars, but they don't know it's again how easy is it to use? How much does it cost? And is it really all the capabilities that I dream about in my head when I think about what I believe to know about signature capture, I have a question.

Client 8: So as are you thinking are you I feel like you're coming at it more of, like, the customer knows they want signature to capture. They they wanna know if they want proceeds signature capture or they could go with a different vendor.

Client 8: It's not just I think that might be kind of what you're trying to get at Diana. They know they want signature your capture. Wanna know specifically if they go with protein signature capture or what's?

Client 2: I think existing customers when we're selling them are solutions that they already know about they're ready to get to number three really fast. And so that's where I was just trying to digest, like, how do you kind of interject one and two when box one two when you're talking to an existing customer who's pretty well informed or it's a it's a thing that's not a mystery. Right? Signature capture is not. What they don't know is proceeds flavor of it and this proceeds flavor check all the boxes that you would think. So Yeah. And it's a very unique, you know, situation. But we get a lot of that with existing customers and especially through customer success is selling our existing products is the signature captures just an interest return. People know what that is.

Client 2: Yeah. And so when they So they generally aren't gonna come to us saying, hey, my primary business objective is to reduce cost.

Client 2: Yeah. Reduce cost. You know, they already know. I specifically wanna solve this pain point, which is excess paper slow ability to recall historical invoices and take and having to manually mail my customers signed scanned copies of their invoices. Like, they know they can get right to the challenge and they know proceeds capability is signature caption. So they're just ready to get to box three, I guess. A lot faster.

Client 3: So then I have two questions. What's your close ratio? And how often do they negotiate on price?

Client 2: Yeah. I don't know that.

Client 3: We need. Okay. So And it knows historically.

Client 9: Well, and and and so, you know, I mean, and I think it's a big part of the reason that we're we're having this conversation here too. Right? Because it is traditionally right to getting signature capture is a pretty low risk proposition for a. Cost me hundred bucks Have you guys set it up. Doesn't cause me anything to run it. Let I'll pay a five hundred bucks to give it a shot. And let's see what happens. Next. Right? And so, you know, this sort of idea sort of capturing that value some of this is gonna be from a customer standpoint. Some of it's gonna be from our standpoint, but this is sort of where those negotiations are are won before they they start Right? And so because especially as we're gonna start switching, you know, the nature of those comp conversations and and as least rental plus three point out comes out our document delivery two point o comes out hot and heavy. Right, but you know, we probably need to make sure that Cs is armed with some of these Pb pbs of you know, v or or kind of the the challenges of one dot x to two around, you know, kind of what are the values that are associated with that Because our customers aren't used to being to having this kind a conversation. Right? If I wanna grow my proceeds footprint. I... you know, i I give you a pitt now and nothing for forever. And and it's I mean, we made that nothing. Right? But like close to nothing. A lot of times and and and bad that is a... you know, these kind of conversations are the groundwork for that back end of you know, document delivery two point o is gonna cost you guys, you know, cumberland got a cost cumberland fifteen thousand dollars a year or whatever it is. Well, sort of. Right? Because what document delivery two point o is gonna do is go drive out a whole bunch of costs from their business. That now we're just asking for a piece of on the way out. And and so to be positioning that kind conversation when we get to the point where we say, hey, seventy bucks a branch, cumberland, you've got seventeen branches, are twelve branches or how many cumberland has you're here's here's what the price is gonna so it is gonna be different for a lot of our customers. Right? Tommy Jackson is gonna be really uncomfortable with this because by the time time calls to he thinks this mine's made up. Right? But Mh. Tommy doesn't make the buying decision here Tommy, he execute the transaction, and we need to be ready to have those conversations with everybody else. And and so, you know, there all are gonna be some customers that that maybe this is a shorter conversation than we're used to having. You But there are plenty of customers out there that that aren't Tommy and and, you know, the you know, obviously, you're always gonna glad to know your audience, but that bad idea right that conversation around cap right now that somebody calls up. Hey, just give me chat. Well, Now we're not just gonna give sick cap. It's gonna be there there's gonna be cost that associated with this. And this helps us position in that conversation when we get there to say, yes, to not just signature capture, but yes to allowing us to of of the value the signature capture provides.

Client 3: your understanding of what we're trying to do is spot on.

Client 2: I said it.

Client 3: Yeah. I... I appreciate it. I I genuinely of how we interject those first to a little bit more And melanie writes to me the impromptu two is better than the role play we're gonna do next.

Client 3: Damn. I appreciate it. I thoroughly appreciate it because that's That's the practical application. And people called and say I know what I need, how much is it? And what ben said is I'm doing some don't. Right? And I'm not gonna say, hold on. I'm in my my sales process. You have to answer sixteen questions. Right? But then I say am I talking to the right person, And do they squeeze me on price at the end? Because if I don't have the value conversation. I just demo and show it to them. It's too late And if you knew exactly how to use that ou board and Crystal Ball, We'd be on the island. It's time for a break. It's ten zero two Would you please look at whatever device you use to track time add twenty minutes? We'll come back and we're gonna go into the role play in Dia. I'd love them with Josh and you. Talk about what abbreviated versions of whom this look like, but in our next role play, please stick to the script because otherwise, we'll have ins interaction during the role play.

Client 3: See in twenty minutes.

Client 8: Yeah. I think having these ready to go for like that. Outbound, customer success sales stuff, like, people who haven't called us now. Asked about signature capture, but when we start to develop with those campaigns to support you guys look like starting from a template like this and then building something out would both Yeah.

Client 9: I I I might also point out that, you know, that the the why did you call... You know, why do you wanna talk about it? You know, it doesn't have to be this whole big thing right and end to be able to, like, actually get to the deal, but somebody calls me up and say, hey, tell me about I'd signature your capture. And these guys love to talk about the dealership. They love it you. Don't know better way say they love the bitch. Right? So, you know, give them an opportunity to talk about the problem and these guys, you know, So so i I... Yeah, I don't know if I get locked and like, the, hey. How this has to go all the way down right that Why you call me today? It is it really instructive question that that can get as far. Yeah.

Client 7: Especially question. I got a question. You know, my stuff was it and and I think you guys are doing great. And and but my question was isn't around kinda that whole roll thing. But hebrew drew and hopefully Jed hasn't left jim. Don't leave yet because this is directly at marketing.

Client 8: That's bathroom.

Client 5: You calling Mary. I'm with you.

Client 7: Alright Thanks. You know, I'm thinking about, like, the marketing and the messaging. Right? I'm thinking about you know, the the messaging that that's el alluded forever, which is why is your business system better? Okay. Why is it better? You know, I'm we're sitting there doing the The y But when you think about it, like inside the departments, when you talk about operational if efficiency. We've never been able to say, x y or z. You know? I remember when I first got here. We were talking to prospects, they were like, well, how fast can you start Our? You know. And so that was kinda one of those measurable thing. But it's just like there's so much else that when you're in these conversations, to identify or that we know within the operating system of the business system that we're better and we're more efficient. You know, we hear, for example, two of them that easy, but these are outside the business system. Is that when we hire new people, onboarding really easy. And it's... you know, the system's is really easy to use and it's really easy to understand and can get people up pretty quickly. That's pretty great. You know, But what does that mean? What average, You know, how long What does it mean when they're up? You know, everybody's got moving targets. But when you look inside process seeing the main best practice processes of the business system. You know, what are those things that we can actually point to and say, Hey, because of the user experience approach to our business system doing x y and z, is incredibly efficient incredibly fast. What does that mean? Get back to it starting the Ro. So there's these things that are just like, know, Cd does it there way. We do it our way Car does it that way. We get an email that says Car max really clunky and hard to use. Okay. What is that mean? Right? And I know we don't have answers, but Larry i.

Client 5: Just think about what I'm thinking here is, you know when we he has the sales process objectives that come up, and I I think it would really help for us a know kind of...

Client 5: If if the sales and marketing could work together, and understand what are the objectives that customers are bringing up.

Client 5: Specific to our parts Yeah.

Client 5: How handle parts or hell handle service?

Client 7: Cd k or Car at parts or service, that Yeah.

Client 7: Is the reason why you're starting to look at our our been. I I would agree with you a thousand percent.

Client 5: And I think if we can we can work together, and look at the objectives, that customers are raising and then work work together on how we would answer those questions and how we would I I think that would be, like, bringing the value same. So you have the objectives and the value statements.

Client 7: That. And so that's the question. I mean, you know, vanessa you've been talking to prospect for a year there's gotta be some common things in part service accounting and reporting that through all of these conversations, these people have been frustrated they're not happy or they're just looking that they've brought up. We don't need a whole crap load of them. I'm sure there's like three per department. Right? And then if we could turned that into really good marketing. Right? So if we got consistent, messaging, accurate messaging, And then you talk about the onboarding new employees, or you talk about the one I wrote down was, like, integrations. you know, we're finding that Cd case falling farther and farther and farther behind especially with Nav dealers, So how do we promote that healthy relationship other than with multiple press releases that we're gonna do with Nav star, but how do we promote that as also if another competitor thing because when you have these integrations and they're more than current, they're working and you have an active healthy relationship between the Oe and the and the dealer. Management system, then you've got a much more robust business system because fifty percent of our stuff is integrations, right? To them, And so I guess that's that's kind of my question. It's like How we And again, it's different than what Dean, I'm not trying to sidetracked the conversation. I think they're...

Client 5: You know I'm trying figure out how do we get those things finally, after all these years and all the work, and bringing the system forward and flat it and blah...

Client 7: And there's still more to do. But there's gotta be a handful of things per department that are consistently frustrating When Cd users and Cd people or Car users and car people. And so can we get those then from that develop marketing approach. because if we... If we... If we're accurate and we resonate well, well, the that'll will continue to help fill up the the the the the pipeline. But but more importantly, you'll have those things as we're talking to the customers, because they're gonna be bringing them up and we'll already know how to kinda respond. Do the things that we're learning here.

Client 2: So it sounds like another flavor of the menu. He brought up instead of saying these are the common things we hear about from other service managers, it's these are the common things we hear about from other dealers who are looking to make a change from Cd. We're looking make a change from Car Back. And then without saying that outright in our press releases. Right? But then you make testimonials that are about specific functionality gains or or improve or efficiencies or or wins based on what our competition doesn't do that we their weakness through our customer testimonials.

Client 7: Right? So if you look at David Cr, current testimonial. It's all around integrations. We just kinda did it But if you listen to what I just said, I'm like, well, that's actually a competitive advantage of our now as we're finding out, they love us more and more. Having all of these integrations when we come out with the scorecard in twenty twenty three with pac are in that whole initiative. So some really, I think big opportunity to uncover is why I wanted to make sure marketing, Yeah.

Client 5: I think I think we have a... The opportunity here is to kinda of formal formalized this because I I you know, each sales is gonna be out there and they're gonna hearing different objectives and, you know, and Dave Wallace goes in talks to a former Cd customer. Me have... he here's what their subject objectives are met talk to somebody else But if we can bring those together, come up with like, hey, your standard Cd k customer objectives. And then you know, eighty twentieth it for the top five or six, we know they're gonna come back with come up with our answers for them. I mean, that's just being prepared. Ahead of time. So I think... Yeah. I think we can work together on that.

Client 7: There's that. And then there's... Like I said, market. Out the world Right?

Client 5: Yeah. And use for marketing campaigns.

Client 7: Yeah. So Vanessa and Dave, I would think that you know what are you guys hearing out there with you know, current Cd customers that wanna come over. Like Todd Fire would be a great example. Why did Todd Meyer and the whole group move from a fusion to back to to us after four years being on fusion. I mean, there's gotta to be specific things. So now Todd's gonna say because the accounting is a lot easier What does that mean accounting a lot easier. Right? We've heard that they're back end around their Api and they're their data architecture broke So what are we doing to promote the strength of X, because of our transaction engine and the architecture that because I know there's dealerships, big dealerships, like Powell tread that they're trying to build stuff on the Api and it's just it's a disaster. You don't have a strong Api or core, then you don't have a strong Api. You have really integrations, which is why I think there's challenges also at the oem working That makes sense.

Client 11: Yeah. Why like... I like this idea of formal some of these asks before I get on a demo. Right? This would be extremely helpful to know their Pb pbs. Before I get in the demo and instead just Yeah. Here's all the stuff I know. I know, you know, can show you anything you wanna see. is it gonna make an impact in having those Pb and maybe being able to take that information then start breaking it down and grouping it by you know, the customer type or what system they're coming from. And you know, trying to group it with buying decisions that they're making. And I think that would be very helpful for me to help them but also we could take that data. And maybe move it along to marketing or just start accumulating it And and by the way, yeah.

Client 7: And by the way, how many former Cd k fusion Ds customers do we have right now that lava us where we could be, like, Hey. Now that you're on the business system. What are the top three things that you really really love versus you know, they were challenges using Cd or challenges. You know what I'm saying, and we can really I think go the next level around these things. And I don't think it's a bad thing if we do it the right way. For example, when we came out with ten dot o One of the first things I said to myself was I wanna show our businesses nobody ever shows their businesses. Prior to them that I never had seen Cd k in an ad Never seen Car in an ad never seen any of it. Right? And I was like, screw that. Here's ten point zero. Come on, bring it. Let's go. Let's play. You now. And so I think we could go even at a deeper level. With customers saying these things. And if marketing was able to grab these things, And then put those out there and then you're also able to build this this database, and then you're able to get it ahead of time. Right? They're coming off Cd. And we have like I said customers where we We could strategically ask them They're gonna say some of the things like we've heard before. Why you just do it a different plan? It's not faster The whole system's more efficient. Well, that's what David K. He goes there. There's not like, one thing. It's like everything. And I'm like Okay. Does that mean? David K? Right? And so that's against what I just got done talking about because if it's everything, Right it's a culmination of all these little things that make up everything. Well, that's a different you know, a different approach and there's a there's a marketing message there as well, but we're like, hey. Give us a thing in parts. Give us the things and serve. Give us the things in accounting. We've always talked about data accents Okay. What is that really mean? Right? And we should be talking about architecture. About having a healthy architect system because we know there's a script. We know that they hired that Jericho Ceo prior to this latest one to rebuild Car fusion That was four years ago, guys. It's broken. So we've got figure out and we know Cd case broker still an as four hundred flat file pick system, mixed with a sql database. Right And because of that, data and information getting in out of it is very difficult. So luckily, that messaging still there, We can come back stronger than ever. With that. But isn't there other things? Does that make sense? I know I'm rambling a little bit, but there's something here, that if marketing was able to extract and we were able to get from our customers and we're able to have them say it, not us, you know, it'll open up more and more doors conversations and then having all of that stuff through that process could be for a healthy Nci world I took over for what Dean was talking about. I apologize. Dean. She's probably taking a break.

Client 11: So... Well, what if... what if we can incorporate something into the... Some type of, like, informal or formal questionnaire if we're going on site. Know, if we're visiting some of these dealers that went live in the last couple years like, hey. I'll buy you some donuts, but spend fifteen minutes with me. And let me just ask you Yeah.

Client 7: Northwest trucks. Right? Ground game. Of the ground game. Right? Tell us where you saw efficiencies blanket statement. Oh, in service, tell us where?

Client 2: How Yeah.

Client 2: Well, so i... The Roi, we've never been good about happened Never been good at that.

Client 7: That's what I.

Client 5: Going back to recent customers, understanding how they've benefited from us.

Client 12: Well, in Merit powers even yesterday in a meeting I have with Merit was like, look, I'll I'll give you for instances. Said, I'll tell you what you guys are better than Cd gay on. So, you know, I think we definitely need to define a better process of being able to share this internally. Hey. You know, at that moment. Is that a good time to say hey. Let me pull, you know, worker or Jodie in, Let's just have a conversation and just ask Yeah.

Client 7: Hopefully, you've been too.

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah. It's it's something I've been trying to get is you know, how every better specifically rather than Uk. Yeah. We're a better system. Our people are better stable leaders so team all that stuff. But in terms of the system capabilities, you know, I've always wanted to see to contact our former Cd former customers and say, okay, Where do we win?

Client 2: I mean, if I was if if I was a customer, what would resonate with me is to go back to what I first is my initial. Right? If I told you, seven months ago through this process, that, like, my focus was increase efficiency. Right? I would want... I I think that where we can dig a little bit more and say, okay, we we that least that was important to you.

Client 2: Right? And so have you seen that manifest? Or And we and try to get more specific larry, you gave me the example the other day, and I think you used it just recently, like, people say all the time, They will... Get it's The system's is great for onboarding new employees. Well, that's great. It's not quantifiable. And that's the Roi that people are always asking us to share but what does that mean? Like, did we did we take their onboarding from you know, it used to have to be a two day workshop to now they can just shadow And so it's no longer a two day workshop. Did they Did they go from meeting you know, I don't know. It's not seeing people be able to create their own orders with customers for until a week after they had started, and now they're doing it by their second day. Like, what does that mean to them? Or does it mean that they just they were able to hire people faster because it was less of a obviously because it didn't have this prerequisite where they had been familiar with some sort of anti automated system. So I don't think we have to be better at guiding some of those targeted things. Because I don't know the customer's don't know that they know how to quantify or articulate that unless they're given a little bit of guidance to get there.

Client 4: They need to up our our competitive research a little bit and talk to, you know, these former customers and find out exactly why they lap for exactly what problems they were having that solves, Like, maybe we could go back to that initial list of really standard These are the roles.

Client 2: These are the common. And come up with a couple of options for Okay. If somebody says, Yeah. I saw an increase in my I saw a positive gain in my bottom line. Great. That's fantastic. But what does that mean in does that mean, you know, and so So maybe we can come up with a couple of related each of those O's, and then we can just outright ask, or outright asked for those examples and like, lead them a little bit.

Client 4: Yeah. Because that, you know, increase in the bottom line Is that because their accounting department is more efficient. Is that because you know, their parts department with their cycle county, inventory county, you know the that slash the the schedule for that and they you know, was able we're able to realize I don't know four hundred and fifty dollars a week extra because of the efficiency at approach...

Client 7: It's kinda like what you were talking about on the Bar or the scan... The signature capture, Right? Seventy five box, seventy five hundred dollars for twenty thousand dollars.

Client 7: Right? When David Creed says Larry, it's everywhere. Increases and efficiencies. And so it's it's it's like Okay. What does that mean to your Roi question is it is it ours? Is it... You know, there's there's certain things like, hey, we're gonna take away the paper and all of a sudden you're saving a person. Right? That's completely different.

Client 4: You're like.

Client 7: That's that's totally you can say, hey, that's a person in that person's fifty thousand dollars a year awesome. We're gonna have to do something else. A lot of time that's gone against us remember Dean. Oh, with you guys, you gotta hire an extra person an account. or you need to hire a sequel person. So we gotta be very careful that was the old way But but we we do not have we have... I think it's there. Right? We wanna to grab it from our customers. What is it now that you're on? I mean, why couldn't we go to Peach state? Why couldn't we have Casey just go okay. Let's just get three things in service and that they have metrics tied to them money time saving and efficiency. Get it from, you know, parts service and accounting. Tell us why. And then there's always gonna be... We can always pound the access to data drum reporting blah blah blah Api, interoperability, the foundation of the transaction engine, Those things are really, really good. But if we can go another layer inside.

Client 7: Mh. And time talk to... We wouldn't talk to Excel right now. But but truck centers, Right Trey would be happy to give us all of their. David Cr was on Cd. What is it now that your people are saying now that they've been on it a while, is better than Cd and why and how that tied to some metric? Time, money, move on.

Client 4: Exactly.

Client 7: I think that from a mark to marketing all of this stuff, by the way, when you develop it, marketing, Can you hand that to somebody like Vanessa and she's got notes from a demo and it's like here's parts And here are the main things we know because they're on Cd to what Doctor Wallace was telling us, Dave, he's like, I need this stuff ahead of time. What is the system? What is their pain point? Who am I talking to? Okay. I mean, that just leads to more and more sales. That all makes sense. And so we were talking Jeeves and I were talking about the I was frustrated about lead nurturing. Right? It's like how do we get you guys working together? You don't have the content And we have a lot of great content. You guys have been doing great. Right? Again, we need to need to polish up. Api our architecture. Or scalable, stable architecture. It's the best in the industry it's not broken. it's ties to how inter the business system is not only with getting data out but also, right, being to have a great Api and all these integrations are easier easier to build and the Oems are building to the Api. So all of that stuff we gotta continue to beat the drum but we have that opportunity to go in and really after these people have been on the business system for a year. Extract Roi and these different departments And not a lot of it just needs to be a couple of things. Because that plus all the other other stuff. Lead us to A marketing nurturing campaign that allows us to be more surgical Tip.

Client 7: Thank you. Who is that Jericho?

Client 3: Jericho. Yeah. It's tactical execution conversation Well, it's they're all So that we as they move through the sales process, that was a joke done.

Client 7: We moved to the sales process. Right? We're all aligned and marketing is feeling more engage in that process because we were talking about how how do we... you guys are doing a great job with content, but it needs to be more tactical. We have the opportunity. Marketing is standing by they're getting more resources. This stuff here builds a sales pipeline that we we we will have it'll be amazing, but we've gotta do this you guys. And we've been talking about it. For years. So I mean, that it's there and we don't know really what it is kind of moving. It's that makes sense.

Client 3: Okay. Welcome back everyone. If you could turn your camera's on, please. I caught the end of that conversation, Larry, and I will say to marketing leaders There's strategic and tactical marketing and the tactical pieces where we help the sellers with the conversations consistently tied into feature functionality, whatever it is. But it's also on the other side of the discovery map to help them understand challenges. And Dia, your point is well made on the customer who knows us and understand this and says I need this. But I wanna make sure that if they're comparing us, I guess they're not comparing us if you're already in their system. They're already on your system.

Client 2: No. It's good though. It's good to just sort of talk through it a little bit.

Client 3: Yeah. Totally agree. Now these are great covered. These are great conversations after the workshop when you have a live opportunity of what's going on and what do we do? Right? It's great. Super. Okay. With you, but leaving camera off by e, Gary we're doing a role play. So set your lunch to the side, I'd appreciate that and we waited for who was it was Josh and he's back? And I think gonna to be back in just a minute.

Client 12: He's preparing the contract for the hosted services agreement with Baltimore.

Client 3: Who wants to ask Josh, how the call wet?

Client 7: Drew is with us. Maybe will right to the horses man Yeah.

Client 9: I was gonna say on.

Client 12: Okay. There we go.

Client 12: Tornado here in we're having tornado here in Orlando. So I keep losing connectivity. So I'm on the phone. So if I drop that that would be was. So it looks pretty bad out there, but Well, josh she shouldn't miss a role play because the tornadoes town.

Client 3: I mean, I'm kidding It'll it'll speed things up How many locations do you have?

Client 10: Pretty quickly.

Client 3: True held the call It went great now.

Client 3: That's it we.

Client 3: Please go ahead.

Client 10: Had very good conversation with Patrick paste, the controller over there. And I already applied Probably be one of the most helpful tips from this meeting so far. Is really bringing it back to finding out what Asterisk expectations are, What he wants from hosted services. He started with a... I have the technical team here from proceeds proceed you know, what can you tell me? About hosted services. What kind of do for me I said, well, in order to really touch on that, let's start with you telling us what you're hoping to gain. From moving over to host. And it was You he sold himself. So Awesome, Drew.

Client 3: It's just a subtle twist of the dog. Right? I don't wanna insult somebody by asking them twenty three interrogation questions about a feature that they already know how to use but I do wanna know if they understand the value that comes with it and what they're hoping to accomplish. And if people... You know some of your customers you know their kids and their birthdays and but it's different than somebody saying send me a quote flying blindly. Somewhere in between Dia we had a great dialogue around that. So I'm gonna ask you when I will play Go ahead, josh.

Client 12: I do think Drew did a really good job on this one because one of the things we did in the beginning with Patrick started talking money, sort of talking price was drew to look. Let's not even talk numbers until you see value. Let's understand what your needs are, Let's understand what the challenges are And let's see if this is even gonna be something that you can find value in before we talk money. Because at the end of the day, if if you can't find how you the money doesn't matter anyway. And then we'll go from there. So he did actually he did a really good job of setting this up. And that was this was our second call. Which turned into a closing call. We asked at the very in, before we move forward, is there anything else that you need to see value and Patrick comment was I see the value. Everything where Right hear tells me we need to go with hosted services.

Client 3: And then the salesperson takes for themselves good then you won't be asking me freddie price concessions at the end. because you see the value.

Client 12: And he didn't. That... And that's what, you know, that whole negotiation thing if you do good, in in one through four, five doesn't really matter. Right?

Client 3: Fantastic. So here's what I'm gonna ask you respectfully to do. We're gonna go into two groups and I'm gonna ask you to stick to the script. Please don't add, please don't because if we do and we have ten people having these conversations, how many different types of conversations will we have? Tobias. So for now, please just do what melanie and I did. One two three, You'll do the Pd, the primary business objective one challenge and one capability we don't need to do too, but I think you see where we're going when you have two or three or four or six, whatever it is. Right? We just want you to see the process. Don't want you to get hung up on questions or I don't like this. I put this there. You'll do that. You're you're going to do that. I heard the tail of what Larry and Jeeves were talking about Helping to put these pieces in place. Please just go through it as it's laid out. M and I are gonna be with you in groups to go through this. Not everybody will be the seller well we're gonna mix it up between seller and buyer, when you're the buyer, we have sent you the guide right melanie. We set that the coaches guide with the answers in red, Yep.

Client 6: Just to the buyers.

Client 3: Yes. So we didn't send them to the sellers. Because we want you to go through the role play take notes And at the bottom of those areas where you recapture what you heard recapture what you heard. Summarize what you heard and moving through the conversation. So we have two groups Bo is gonna send you there in a minute. And in My group, In the first role play melanie is going to be the buyer and Jeeves will be the seller. Okay, Jeeves. So you're gonna sell to moly on the first one. And then in that same group, Judy, you will be the buyer and Drew will be the seller. And then the third role play will be Gary will be the buyer and David will be the seller. Okay One group is gonna stay here with me in the main room and in the first role play vanessa, you'll be selling to me And the second role played, Josh, you'll be the buyer and Hamilton will be the seller. And then in the third role play, Dia will be the buyer and Dean will be the seller. When we go through the data is still without a about.

Client 3: Okay. So we put him third for a reason. Hopefully, he comes back.

Client 3: Okay. If he doesn't, Diana, I can sell to you or there there's value in being the buyer. There's value clearly of being the seller. But there's also value when you're not in a speak role listening and observing what somebody else does. You will pick things up for what other people are doing. So please, if you're not in an active role, stay in the role play listen. And listen for things that you can use to refine the way that you go about these conversations. Okay? So please don't go on break when you're not in an active role, Listen. How often do you get to listen in or the sales call? Right? So let's listen in on what that dialogue sounds like stick with the script just go through those pieces. Some you'll like. Some you'll say, oh it's two scripted. Just hang in there with us And then we'll talk about reality right... We already did talk about reality. Dean brought reality yep. Stop doing that. What are you dia? I don't have that my agenda here where We'll talk about reality right after it.

Client 11: I did not receive an email. You did not. And I am a buyer or a seller.

Client 8: Hi Melanie. Thanks for showing me around your facility today. Found it very interesting to observe some of the projects you have going on and meet some of your team members.

Client 6: Very nice to meet you too.

Client 8: So you followed up and called and asked me to tell you about Colombo Before I tell you about us, I like to understand what you're hoping to accomplish by at our products and services.

Client 6: Oh, I have all sorts of initiatives for the new year.

Client 8: Alright. Some objectives have heard him other gonna say your controller. Controllers recently are they're looking to reduce costs. They're looking to increase service and they're looking to increase efficiencies. Any of those that sound like current priorities or objectives for you?

Client 6: I'd like to improve data access and increase accuracy of financial data.

Client 8: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Do you have a specific cost reduction target in mind?

Client 6: It's difficult to measure it just needs to get better.

Client 8: The of my script. That's the last question. On this page in my script. So let me go over to the discovery app. Is that right? Yeah. Alright. And around back. Alright. Sorry. What did... Can you repeat your Yeah. You're challenge.

Client 6: Have been built to measure, it just needs to get better.

Client 8: It needs to get better. Okay. So you have no actionable data. You're having difficulty measuring it, and that's stopping you for making timely decisions. So what is happening currently from help you getting that information in a timely fashion Well we don't have visibility to the data, Do you have daily reports?

Client 6: Yes.

Client 8: Okay. And what time of day do you run those?

Client 6: They're running the evening Does that cause any problems for you?

Client 6: Yeah. It's we're not seeing trends.

Client 8: Alright. So... Let's see. You already kind of answering how specifically. So we supposed to jump down into the impact person Sure.

Client 6: Or you can say how specifically.

Client 8: Alright. How specifically? With skipping head your buyers, but repair orders are staying longer saying open longer than necessary and it's causing delays in a realized revenue.

Client 6: Alright.

Client 8: So How many... what's the number of repair orders that you as they are delayed for location?

Client 6: Probably fifteen per month.

Client 8: Fifteen a month. Alright. And do you know your average cost per repair order?

Client 6: Yeah. It's about fifteen thousand dollars.

Client 8: Fifteen thousand per repair. And how many locations are your dealership? You ending about fifteen.

Client 6: Fifteen, on the fifteenth.

Client 8: And what is the percentage cost of the delay?

Client 6: One percent. One percent.

Client 8: Alright. I am really bad in that. I'm gonna say You guys didn't have the answer for me on here but So we're supposed to skip over to... So what would you say the total cost? You have that in your answer?

Client 6: Mh.

Client 8: Yeah.

Client 6: Thirty three thousand seven hundred and fifty month.

Client 8: Forty eighty thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars a So that's what this challenges is costing you. So if you could see your repair orders a supporting transactional and real time And then would you be able to see the trends make decisions for corrective action also implement processes to reduce the your wi in timely manner.

Client 6: Yeah. I think so.

Client 8: Alright. How much is about forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars you think you could realize by not pushing the orders to be later.

Client 6: I'd say fifty percent. Alright.

Client 8: We skipping down to the bottom. So in summary you shared that You're losing about forty is costing about forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars. Your repair orders are delayed. So the impact so your business is forty three thousand and you're saying... Sorry Again i'm totally feeling at this. And also sides, we're going up the exact same example we already went over.

Client 6: Like... Yeah. That's just practicing thing.

Client 8: Alright. Well, I'm doing horribly at it. So then I was supposed to remember the number that in which I didn't write down. And say so you went with Percy then we were able to your your repair order situation you would be able to save. What did you say, like, ten percent or something?

Client 8: Yes. So you'd be able to save about like, forty three hundred dollars per month. Yes. Alright.

Client 6: Good job.

Client 8: I don't mind going first and failing.

Client 6: And then do you wanna close the call?

Client 8: It on the second date and all the back There we go.

Client 4: I'm happy to meet you too.

Client 10: So you you originally called an asked me to come in and to tell you about proceeds proceed. But before I do that, you know, tell you a little bit more about us I really need to understand what you're hoping to accomplish. By looking at our products and services. To what's the overall objective that you're focusing on at the moment?

Client 4: Have all sorts of initiatives for the new year.

Client 10: All sorts of initiatives. Okay. Hopefully, we can elaborate on that a little bit. So some of the objectives that I heard recently was reducing cost. Increasing services and efficiencies. What specifically those would be your current priority objective.

Client 4: Sorry. That's not what my page that's Okay. So...

Client 4: improved data access and increased accuracy of financial data. I'm reading the answer kind.

Client 4: So it has different.

Client 4: Two and three are different.

Client 8: I don't know if we are actually supposed to read from Page forty or if you're supposed to make up a new one from Page thirty six.

Client 4: Got lot. Well, I thought the buyer this has the answers on it.

Client 6: Yeah. Yeah. As the buyer you just... Yeah. So it'd be improved data access increase Yeah.

Client 4: I I just he he confused me with... Because one two three are different.

Client 10: Sorry about that. So improved data access increased and what?

Client 4: Accuracy of financial data.

Client 10: Accuracy of data. Okay. So can you tell me more? What is your cost reduction target.

Client 4: It's for Sorry.

Client 10: Do top of page thirty No. I'm I'm reading up a page thirty nine. I just wanna make sure if I'm supposed to be reading up of another page or not.

Client 6: Right. You're right.

Client 10: Who's right? Okay. Perfect through. Yeah Alright. So with the current objective, what is your cost reduction target? What are you it's difficult to measure just needs to get better.

Client 10: Just seems to get better. Perfect. Well, an interest of, you know, time creating reports manually and try to dressed up tell me how you can compile that data today.

Client 4: Accounting staff builds the report manually.

Client 10: Doing it manually. Okay. Which reports specifically are you building manually and how often so how many and how often.

Client 4: D P and L, and custom department reports. Rebuilding them building many reports daily.

Client 10: I'm gonna reports do you actually create Many.

Client 10: Okay. And who exactly is comp those is that you?

Client 4: Accounting analysts.

Client 10: On average, how much time you team spending building those reports.

Client 4: About ten hours a wait or forty hours a month.

Client 10: Forty a month. Okay. And can you maybe elaborate what you're paying each one of those employees, you know, what their average hourly rate Thirty dollars.

Client 10: So And then how many analysts do you have?

Client 4: We have five.

Client 10: F five. Doing some quick math here. If, you know, the average hourly be raised thirty bucks times five employees and you're spending forty hours. Doing some quick math here. Think you're spending about six grand every month. On building these reports. That's not about right Yeah.

Client 4: That sounds right.

Client 10: So if you had a a real time system that generated stand standardize those custom reports, then potentially, we could save you time and the off of those employee resets. Resources that six grand. How much of that six grand do you think we could actually save one hundred percent.

Client 10: A hundred percent. Okay. Perfect. So with our capability that we discussed today, we see that there's a benefit of six thousand dollars. I got that right.

Client 4: Yes. Six thousand month. Correct.

Client 10: And now is there anything else that you'd like to discuss No.

Client 4: That's it.

Client 10: Okay. And as we continue these talks, we should be involved moving forward.

Client 4: The dealer principal and the service manager.

Client 10: Perfect. And it's assuming that, you know, we are moving forward. What's the timeline for this implementation? When are you looking to get to completed by as soon as possible.

Client 5: Yeah. Happy me.

Client 11: You called and asked me to come in and tell you about proceed before. Before I tell you about us, I would like to understand what you're hoping to accomplish by looking at looking at our products and services, what is the business objective you are focusing on?

Client 5: Oh, wow I have all sorts of initiatives this New Year.

Client 11: Some of the objectives I've heard from other controllers, r, reduce costs, increased service, increase efficiencies. What is your current priority or objective?

Client 5: Yeah. We're really trying to improve our data access and increase the accuracy of financial data.

Client 11: Okay. Tell me a little bit more. What is your cost reduction target Well it's difficult to measure.

Client 5: It just needs to get better.

Client 11: Sorry. We're working on one or two.

Client 5: Much the number one's good.

Client 11: Okay. What is happening currently to keep you from getting data in a timely fashion.

Client 5: You know, we just don't have visibility to the data.

Client 11: Don't you have visibility to the data?

Client 11: Do you have gained reports you can run?

Client 5: Yeah. It's not built out yet and we do have daily reports we can run.

Client 11: When they ran?

Client 5: Just in evening what what problems does that cause?

Client 5: You know, what we're not seeing our trends.

Client 11: Does this cause problems of visibility into service process?

Client 5: Yes. Absolutely How specifically?

Client 5: Well repair orders are staying open longer that's sir that causing delays in our realized revenue.

Client 11: Okay. Well, let me ask you this. What are the number of repair orders delayed per location It's about fifteen average per month?

Client 11: Okay. And what is the average cost of each repair order?

Client 5: Fifteen thousand dollars and how many locations do you have?

Client 5: Fifteen locations.

Client 11: Okay. And what is the cost per delay?

Client 5: One percent one percent. Okay.

Client 11: Give me a second. Let me do some quick math here. So figure fifteen. You're looking at about thirty three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars per month. Is that sound about right?

Client 5: Wow. Yeah. That's sounds about right. Okay That seems like a pretty big number.

Client 11: If you can see you repair orders, and the supporting transactional detail in real time Do you think you can see those trends that make decisions for corrective action? Implement new processes to reduce your work process in a timely manner. And if so how much of that you know, thirty two thousand, do you think you could realize not pushing the orders to be later you know, yeah.

Client 5: If we could get fifty percent, and I think probably about fifty percent of that we can can improve, Okay.

Client 5: Do you see enough value for us to continue our dialogue.

Client 5: Yes Okay.

Client 11: Do you have an idea of what budget has been assigned?

Client 5: To this we don't have an assigned budget yet. Hey Sorry.

Client 11: Who else should we involve in our to our discussion?

Client 5: Well, our dealer principle Call letter. Is it colleague? Come?

Client 5: And service manager Marshall Fa.

Client 11: Alright. Excellent. Assuming that we are an agreement to proceed, what is your timeline to get this done.

Client 5: I'm ready to go. Asap.

Client 11: Alright. Well, thank you for your time today. I wanna take this information back to my office and summarize my understanding of our conversation email and make sure we're aligned.

Client 6: Alright. Dean Are you there dean?

Client 10: I see name see your face, and I can't hear your voice Thank you still having power issues.

Client 6: Okay.

Client 13: Alright. I'll just... I'm here. I can't... I I can see you guys. I can see the screen I just my Internet power.

Client 13: Bond last night.

Client 6: You're actually supposed to be in the other room as let me try to put you in the other round.

Client 13: Great.

Client 6: Hold on a second.

Client 6: I'm gonna put you in the room with Jericho and the others Okay.

Client 6: You should see a thing that says join Okay. There he goes. Okay Alright. We have got little bit extra time. How are you guys feeling? You guys wanna go over it anymore or think I think it's good.

Client 11: We're really... I mean, for me to summarize, you know, we're just breaking things down to monetary value where making sure we're gonna gather the information to hit our targets for a future call. And try and, you know, get to the objective of their you know, their problem how we're gonna solve their problem. Just preparing ourselves before we go in. And wow with anything.

Client 8: And I i'd say from marketing, like, what? What we would like is we've always struggled in the customers, they don't know how to less. They just so... Yeah. The pieces efficiencies. We've never been able to, like, get them to quantify it. So the first time I did this workshop. This is the part... That this is Map the most exciting to me because it's showed how you can ask escalating questions and get them to give you the information, and then From a customer's perspective, they're helping us and then we can put Together. But from a sales perspective if it's at if it's a prospect, they're like, giving you the data and there's so they're self down it. Right? So they are already... You're not telling them. They're giving you numbers and you're just reading it back to them and then getting them to degree to it. So don't even have to trust you because they told you themselves. Then later down line. you have to actually, you know, show the capabilities and deliver on that. At least upfront, you're getting the information from them. So on the marketing side, I would love to, like, run this do with our customers and get some of this information out of them with help from customer fast so that we can have actual numbers for. Of value and efficiency gains, and then we can turn around and give those to you guys ahead of the calls. When you say, hey, when talk to other controllers, like, we've been able to help them with this x y z or whatever. So you can... Kinda goes in a circle?

Client 11: Yeah. My only concern with some of this is, you know, some of the customers are just, like, you know, thursday.

Client 11: Do they think they're the best salespeople people in the world and they know when they're being put together and they're like, hey, you know, I'm not gonna answer the question just show me how the r was. Created. Just show me like, no. I'm not answering your questions. And so I think we'll probably get some of that occasionally and you know, I don't know what what the best way to overcome some of those objections are other than just knee and go. Yeah. I'll go ahead and show you or or asking more questions. What do you wanna see about the repair order. What do you... What are you trying to see or what are you trying to gain by seeing this? Or something I could show you that is different. Maybe just some follow ups questions. But that's to be determined. Right? Yeah That's a good question for Jericho too when we go back into the the main room they think a good plane is dave.

Client 8: Like, it seems like really pushing and aggressive if you're just like, reading the script, but if you obviously it comes a time and practice. Like, if you weave these ends, the discussion kinda more naturally than just like hitting them question question after question after questions through your partner of the sales process.

Client 8: Maybe everything doesn't happen in, like, one call like exactly like it goes down on here, then it seems less kind of obvious and aggressive. But it's a lot to keep track of for sure.

Client 11: I did some of this in implementation when they with a problem that this system wouldn't it handle very well, then I would try and break it down. To like, how much is a custom for our solution for an alternate process when you don't have their exact answer, you know, or their exact one So there's some of that, but it's not from a sales perception. Perspective more of a... you know, but i guess it is sales kind of as solution suggestion, like hey. I can't do what you want. But let me understand how much just is costing or why you need it to be exactly like this. Maybe there's some other way somewhere else with another process that can, you know, save you more time and help absorb some of this. Time that you're spending here. That was that was part of it, wouldn't we got really complicated stuff. Really difficult objectives or objections.

Client 6: Yeah. And the script is not... you know, obviously then they'll be all. So you can kind of morph it as you see fit. As you're talking to your customers clients, Great. You guys are great. Got a few minutes left.

Client 5: Yeah The other thing I gonna say is that it always seems like I mean, what the the point the end we're getting out before, like, You guys pushy a customer and you can't follow the process. Or... But think in like, ninety nine percent of the time, the customers want you to follow want you to have the right process and it they actually appreciate it when you go take them through the correct sales process because you're not trying to sell them something that they don't not interested in or, you know, you've just come done the discovery and you you're speaking to the points they really wanna hear.

Client 6: Absolutely and then it pointing out, like, the document delivery, like, Some things are cheap and.

Client 8: We don't need to show that value, but there are gonna d times in the customer calls and they say i want document labor in whatever this solution is. I've heard about it. I want it. And then they get to the price then you're gonna wish you had provided the value upfront. Because, you know, then they're were like, oh, I wanted it, but this seems like a lot of money. And if you haven't done that to I due diligence upfront and already can't go back them and say, hey, I already showed... We already discussed this and we've agreed that this is the value of it that offsets this. So I do think even for existing customers. There's a a benefit. Even if they're already just calling and saying I want this. They didn't watch it until they see. The pricing of it. So it'll help with that.

Client 10: That I was touching on the path I called the morning. He initially said, hey. Tell me about this great thing. And we had to test price yet. And It really wanted him to say, tell me what you want out of that and that enabled Todd and Andrew to touch on those specific point. Now that you know that it does everything you wanted to do here's the price. And they work out. Well, Awesome.

Client 11: Yeah. And i I feel like, you know, me being new to sales at proceeds software, I'm doing all these demos and sometimes I feel like I'm just going down this rabbit hole of just showing feature after feature after future and you know, i'm trying to get them to speak up or say anything and they can't. So This is some good information for me to maybe like, slow my role and ask some questions and try and incorporate that. So I make sure that I'm hitting the mark and not just you know, saying what I think a dealership needs to see or what would be good for them. Yeah I've noticed that happening a lot. I I've only been doing that doing demos for a few weeks now. So This would definitely be beneficial I feel.

Client 6: Right. Okay. We see where Jericho is at We've got like, three minutes some of you didn't take a break earlier. I I noticed. So if you wanna run the restroom or anything real fast, feel free.

Client 10: Thank you.

Client 8: Did you... Are you just waiting to go back into the main room?

Client 10: Yeah. I'm just seeing about.

Client 6: Okay. Nice.

Client 10: Yeah.

Client 6: I'm gonna close the rooms in a second. I just wanna make sure he's ready.

Client 8: And then in Lens is at twelve thirty.

Client 6: It is, yes.

Client 8: Gonna go turn my oven off. I was a little premature.

Client 6: Okay. Here we go. I'm gonna close the room. So we're all go to the main room. Standby.

Client 3: Alright. Look at that. Everybody came back.

Client 3: That doesn't always happen. So Are you ready for the question? How the call go.

Client 3: Great, Jericho. It went great truth thanks for asking.

Client 1: We swapped recipes.

Client 3: They think that now with if Tat can stop lying and injuring himself in the off season the pad have a chat.

Client 9: Better be careful with that one was the guy that's paying for this We right clear right on the edge we touch touch a serious nerve there.

Client 3: So here's the moral the story. And in our group, we talked about different words and here there there was three really good conversations. Really good. Even with scripts and things, And yes, so you gonna change it. I ask you when you think about this, structure content and style. On any of the things we're talking about structure, We hope you leave it roughly the same. Content and style, is that gonna change? Of course it is. The content is what you talk about. The style is the way in which you do it. Right? But structurally, we hope you leave it the same for a reason. Because if we don't, and we have ten different role plays, who gets confused? Everybody. The customer gets confused we get confused So I don't want to go into. I do appreciate it. Because when you ask these questions, you're thinking about how to use it. It's terrific, And that's really what it's about. Other thoughts melody from your group team or What did your cat think of the role place? Is the cat have any feedback?

Client 6: She just showed up. We we, you know, stuck the script, but we had some good conversation.

Client 3: Any any from that group key takeaways I loved it. I would not say it that way. All are accepted.

Client 9: You know, to Jericho, just I guess maybe maybe just a thought here. Right? Is that you you know, and and so when we talk about You know how how the meeting go? Right? But of times we think about closing and we think about the big close. Right? And and and the end of it. Right? And, you know, I I think there's a... You know, you think about this structure, right, that the that the There's an order that we asked for here even if it wasn't a dollar amount, Right? And and so there were some objectives that we had in terms of wanting to understand homes wanting to start to assign value to problems. And and the order that we're asking four is to continue or, you know, a lot of times i i put this in, you know, kind of the context of a demo If the order we're asking for is we're asking for a service manager to say, hey, If you guys move this thing forward at the very least I will quit. Right? Have we gotten enough covered here that you can sign off on this in the bigger context of this conversation.

Client 3: And you know, in this case, we're just looking at putting a dollar on this thing and and the order is is the next call.

Client 9: And and, you know, especially, we have a a... you know, for the Nci side, things process that is is long and labor and is major as it is for these dealerships, you know, having a defined objective. Right? And no the order that we're gonna ask for at the end of this thing, makes those, you know, it it gets us to an easier point of you know, with Jebediah young from str sales when we come in and we say hey, Are we ready to go this year. Right? Can we move forward this year all of the other, you know, now all of the other stuff was a yes. Right? So so this really can't be a no anymore because we've There's no real reason for this to be a no. We've all out all the other yes. And I think that's kind of my big takeaway when I think about this structure is what are the objectives that we need to hit here? And if we can tick those boxes off what's the order that I'm asking for here today Yes.

Client 9: And and that's the the the metric for a successful meeting is did I get the order that I was looking for today even if it's not monetary.

Client 3: Wonderful. There's a old school very funny Bad selling behavior movie called Glen Gary Glen Ross ...I was I was gonna go there, but I thought it was it, you know, a b c for sure.

Client 3: Always be It's horrible.

Client 3: It's funny as hell. Alec Baldwin what is.

Client 8: The.

Client 3: Coffee is for closer and it's If you have time over the holidays, it's fun to watch. Grab a beer glass wine. It is funny.

Client 1: My boyfriend just had that on. I think he's watched it, like, three times already this month. So I'm gonna pass because he has that on all the time in his hilarious.

Client 3: So... Yes. And his behavior is gonna reflect that. That's a heads up. So Abc b, I say Hamilton is always be confirming. Not closing. Buyers hate this closing shit. Pardon me. Buyers hate to be treated that way. Josh, if we can meet your objectives today, are you ready to get into the car of your dreams, I mean, come on. But if we go in a logical sequence and we have criteria, and yes Dia, one of them is gonna be a demo, you're gonna have to show them what you mean by just describing it. Can we move forward? And I'm not the red cross. You know, Not laying down and saying we're just gonna show up for nothing, I want to work on qualified opportunities. And I wanna know that we're moving in the same direction. In your conversations What did you say at the very end? You're looking right here? What did you say at the very end? Thank you for your time. Then what did you say?

Client 11: You asked to set up a time you ask for the next to move on to the next?

Client 3: Stay with Dave. I... Dave I don't like saying always and never always ask for the next conversation. Amazed how many salespeople anybody up with who say, okay. We'll be in touch. Well We'll we'll touch base. Horrible. Ask for the next conversation. What else did you say?

Client 9: You gave gave an opportunity continue to build credibility. Right? I've got a deliverable. I'm gonna take the first step.

Client 3: And I'm gonna send you a summary of our conversation. So let's go to page forty nine, please, page forty nine. And here it is on page forty nine. Or forty nine is a checklist. Instead of saying to Drew. How did the call go? I could say drew. What was the title of the person that you met with? What was her Pb? What challenges did she have with impact? What capabilities did you talk about with value who else should be involved? What's their timeline? What are the next steps? There very different questions that say how the call, And you can use this before you go into a meeting or after. Here's the checklist. Will you get all of this information like you did in our role play all the time? No way You could talk about a challenge for twenty five minutes and then position a capability and say I'll follow up. Or maybe you just go in and diagnose only. Maybe go way and talk about challenges and say, let me put something together and come back. That's not what I said to you when we did one two three. And then the next page, please melanie, so there the checklist. And then here is the outline of the meeting summary. On page fifty. Here's the outline of the meeting summary. And this is meant for instructional purposes only. We do not put bold colored primary business subjective challenge you laughed but we had a salesperson who did, who said that. And in honor of Orlando Josh look like we were selling through Disney at this point. It's just crazy. So what do you think of the structure of the meeting summary? Anyone? Jody, what do you think of our structures?

Client 4: I think it's pretty complete. I mean I'm a very structured person. And so this lays out everything easy to read with the bullet points and it you know, there's no confusion about what capabilities are with the challenges are, you know, all this stuff. So this this would be an amazing email that that I received that it would lay everything out very easy to read.

Client 3: And will I get all of the information Jodie all the time I'm doing these calls, Now, Of course, not.

Client 3: Of course, not. And I'm not sending it so that it looks like spam either. Right? I wanted to be coming out of a draft email folder or if it connects to dynamics, whatever you use to do that want to look authentic.

Client 3: So there's the structure please don't change the structure. Because if we do and we have eleven people on this meeting how many different structures will we have?

Client 4: Eleven.

Client 3: Who will get confused?

Client 4: Eleven people.

Client 3: Eleven people customers people who are doing your implementations who could really use this tool when they know what they're working on, here's the structure and then Melanie please go to next page fifty one. And here is the email itself. Your meeting summary. And this covers everything. And we agreed that you won't get everything in one sales call. Just take a read through that, please. And I know what you're thinking, because some of your salespeople people and sell by it's too long. They'll never read all this, but that's the smiling it's exactly what you thought. Should send your boyfriend and beating summary on him watching Clint Gary Clint Ross, Vanessa. So maybe you only get the top third of this. In the first conversation. And then you chunk it out. Right? You took it out.

Client 8: I think as a purchaser of something, if somebody sent me this, and I had like, pass it on to like paleo we're considering purchasing Mckenna or whatever and the reps sent me, like, something this concise and with all the information there that I could easily pass on to the other decision makers, I would be so excited.

Client 8: Yeah. Because They know all this work for me.

Client 3: I was just going to say How is this tool used by us? But how is this tool used by then and you just said it yet. So I'm gonna send you a twenty dollar bill. Thank you for doing that. And you're on the buying side of Market, you're going through and it's complex by. Right? It's not a simple buy. But Larry says to Jeeves How's it going with Bar? And normally, she would say, great. But instead she has this how much selling goes on when we're not there? More than I like to admit Larry says that Jeeves How it going she forwards this. And who else are your buyer side? Could benefit from this before the demo and before the implementation. Because you're talking to maybe two key players, but how many need to be involved? It Right. And this is early. Right? This is early opportunity development. And think about those opportunities you worked on two years ago where they called you back and said, we're interested. Let's have another call. You think that's great. What do we talk about two years ago? So think about the use of this tool. And I'm not gonna say and is Ben still on. He turn his camera think have lunch. When and where this should be used? And ben we talked about this and... I'm not asking you for hard and fast rules on usage of this But certainly before we commit to spending a lot of resource should have one of these Look I mean, I I think some version of this goes out after after every time we get together.

Client 9: The and probably not always this formal, but, you know, just... That every time that we have a service demo partner demo, as we, you know, get more bodies more eyes, you know, the vanessa is gonna be here to continue to sort of be our drill sergeant and around process know... Some version of this needs to go out after every time we meet customer any kind formal way.

Client 3: So I'll leave it at that with you for now when we pick back up with you in the new year And we're talking about specific opportunities and where you are the development and who you're speaking to about what? This is what we'd like to see. And for now, you brought one opportunity to the work workshop. So let's work on that one. We'll work on that we'll. We'll do that here. In a few minutes.

Client 12: Well, this really does help too on the customer success side. Right? Because then when we see this, because we're gonna be going into the Crm. Now that we'll have visibility into everything will be able to six months a year in say, hey, Look, I know this is what you said you know, you felt like you could recognize are you seeing that value, which then generates a referral or a reference. Right? So we can we can make sure we're staying on track. So it's a good touch point. Post live you know, So and Josh say it was two years ago, and you do annual business review or quarterly business review or they get bought or they buy somebody or I mean, change is inevitable.

Client 3: Right? So how do you and dia splice this as you're going through? And say they they have they use forty percent of our feature functionality where can we take up next? I mean, so many different ways.

Client 12: Absolutely.

Client 3: And it also helps because I don't know about you, but my memory is not getting better I often ask myself. Why did I walk into the garage that's exit question, But this helps me to stay organized in those efforts with the key players So this is a valuable tool the discovery map is the foundational tool to drive those conversations. This is the output. And this is extremely powerful. So thinking about your discovery map conversations, and the output of the meeting summary what we're gonna do next is we're gonna go back into our rooms and take a look at the opportunity reviews that you brought And here's what I'd like you to do. Take a look at the opportunity review Can we go back up to forty nine? And use the checklist. Take a look at the opportunity brought to the workshop and use the checklist. And look at the bottom of the page. It says What information do you still need to get? What information do you have? What information do you still need to get? This is you're gonna self grade these. Right? This is not us coming in to a homework assignment. But the next step This is what we wanna hear after you do this exercise. What's the next step you need to take? And I'm not suggesting that you stop developing opportunities that you call the customer I failed to accurately identify your P. Nonsense. You have pieces going Just fill in the gaps. Hey, just to clarify, I know you're operations manager, we haven't had a chance to talk and you wanna increase visibility into data. What do you think she's looking for? And I'd like to have that conversation. So we're gonna go back in Melody we'll have five people in each I don't think everybody has an opportunity review, but most do So the first thing we want you to do when we go back into the room Is share for two or three minutes. Not five Not seven. It was a warm night in August when I pulled into the parking lot. We want you to take a look at your opportunity review, get your thoughts together And then for two or three minutes each share with each other say, Here's what I've got. Here's the next step. And then Hamilton it, when we come back in, Let's go rather bet Dia. Let's ask each other what's the next step in your opportunity? Where's the place that we wanna to fill in that information. Alright. So any questions to the team of what we're asking you to do here? So Melody if we do twenty minutes if we have five people, each shares for two or three minutes. You don't need the whole origin and history of the opportunity development And then when we come back as a group, let's hear. Let's hear if there's common themes like what we need to go get. Or if we're doing something really well the person across from you could learn from that this exercise. In the full workshop On the last half day you committed you present this opportunity. You go from lead to revenue. You walk through every step and you future cast some of it and say, what I'm gonna do. Here's what to do. Is just a consolidated version of that. Alright. So Melody, if you would again, please, send this out And mah, we can just monitor or answer questions but it's mostly the team just speaking amongst themselves, Okay.

Client 6: Here we go. Or not. Was like is everybody again?

Client 9: I don't think we got very far me.

Client 6: Alright. Sorry. Technical difficulties. Please stand by.

Client 13: Hi, Jericho.

Client 8: Got you can't.

Client 13: I'm I'm up and going again.

Client 3: Where are you danger look like you're in the mountains?

Client 8: Yeah.

Client 13: I like that... My play lakes superior, Saskachewan.

Client 3: Nice We got bond nine.

Client 9: I heard with snow.

Client 8: And glad this is not the uri I flight to Indiana.

Client 3: Okay. We're headed back. We'll see you there folks.

Client 6: Okay. We only we have Whoops. Hold on a second. There's only Jody and Josh in here.

Client 12: And And I don't think either one of us have opportunities.

Client 6: Josh you go to... Let's see. Hold on a second. Josh is it not asking you to join Room one?

Client 12: It just popped up.

Client 6: Okay Nice Thank you.

Client 3: To apparently outdated it. Melody to you or somebody from your group wanna to summarize? Observations from grading your own homework. Anybody from your group want to speak up?

Client 6: I thought they all did really well, but who wants to speak up from group.

Client 3: Or or what was an A aha from your group? From your opportunity or just hearing your from bali group. Anyone?

Client 10: I I personally had this realization for my opportunity. I thought I'm already knew the Pb. So I immediately went into just talking about everything that we could do and within, you know, our solution. And what so grade about it I mean, so just being disciplined now to say, okay. Just because we've known this discuss two thousand and three. We have a very close relationship. Does not mean I get to determine the the Ppo for them. So follow the process. And stick by the book.

Client 3: We could talk about how great we are all day right through. It's fantastic. We have the word number one phone finger and but they just...

Client 3: They determine the value and Even with existing customers, tis the season to find out what's important to them for next year the Pd o could change?

Client 11: I have... I did mine based on a demo I or series of demos I did. And I feel like I left a lot of a lot of meat on the bone by not asking enough questions here. Going through and then going through this exercise today.

Client 11: And realizing, you know, I don't know I didn't know who who the champion really was. Left a lot of information on the table as far as, you know, what what they were needing to see instead of wanting to see and just, you know, more questions I would ask given another opportunity, Dave...

Client 3: Can you go back and ask? Is it too late? Like as the ship sale? Or can you go back?

Client 11: No. It's not too late.

Client 3: Go back not gonna say Dave, you forget... You failed to ask direct questions during discovery, or quantify the financial impact. Right? I mean, unless they went through the training okay.

Client 9: They did. You know, to it... And and and one of the things that, you know, there was... That's two questions that were sort of, you know, kind continuing to to to bob through my head as we're going through this and thinking about Dave in particular. Right? But you know, do do really powerful questions there are always gonna be you know, what do you mean by that how does it look for you today? and and one of the things that Dave and I've been talking about is, you know, the different between, you know, and somebody asked you what time it is. Wanna know what time it is, or do you wanna know how to build to watch? And and those kind of two questions right gonna inform what the response is that you know, how much have they thought about the problem? How deep do we need to go or towards point shoot here too. So I think you know, your your your thoughts here are our our are always good ones, but in particular, they're good... They're good right here there.

Client 3: But vanessa so please share your comment on the use to the meeting summary during opportunity development.

Client 1: I think it's crucial and it's gonna help think to echo what Josh said about clarification, to be able to say this is, you know, what I heard and just clarify that everyone's on the same page is huge. And also, throughout the whole evaluation process, I'm I I would like to use it because I think it helps document and show the value overall. So clarification and sells the value.

Client 3: In and around the demo before and after the demo as well Yeah let's make sure we're doing the demo for the right reasons that everybody agrees.

Client 3: What they wanna see from the demo and then what happens after? Because we can shorten our process to two steps Demo purchase order demo purchase order. Wouldn't that be nice.

Client 3: But it generally doesn't happen that way. If it does, please call me. I got an update. I gotta update the content that I go through with you. So it's eleven fifty nine in Palo Alto were due for our second twenty minute break, We're tracking well you're interacting and you're talking about how to use this, which is the key to a really good workshop. So let's do that when we get back for our final hour and forty minutes and enjoy your break. C and twenty. If you come on back, please, appreciate that. Okay. So If you recall, about eight thirty, thirty minutes into r review of the Pay. I said, we were gonna go to stage two discovery, and we just spent the bulk of this review in stage two to discovery. and Melody, if you could take us back to page fifteen, please, We're spending roughly seventy percent of our time today on discovery. Because that is the most critical part of the selling process. And the use of the discovery that and the output being the meeting summary, Those pieces are absolutely critical. K. Well, I got the wrong page here for sure. That's Do you have a different one melody? Then looking for the proceeds sales process map on page fifteen. Of the of the manual. Or are you in the manual?

Client 6: Oh yeah.

Client 6: Hold on a second. Try this one more time How's that?

Client 3: There you go So if you could scale that down, please to size. So we skipped stage one. We'll talk about that a little bit, but we're in two for most of the workshop. And we hope that's where you spend most of your selling time. Or opportunity development time in stage two. And what we did it too is we we use the discovery map a way to have a targeted conversation with a key player that we asked to speak to other key players, who else would be involved. So we're gonna go now to stage three qualified. And in stage three, we do the same thing that we did in stage two. We're gonna use the discovery map to have conversations with the other key players who involved in this opportunity that we're developing. Simone, if you could shoot back up to fifty five, please And jacob i just sort of call back to another earlier point here.

Client 9: Right? And and and certainly, this is probably a little bit more straightforward part on that customer success side of our of of this, But, you know, when we look at this, right we talk about There's there's the the big sale. And then there's every mini sale within it. Right? And so I think it important for us to be thinking about, you know, on the Nci side of things. I'm non this process is, right? That we are going over and over and over and over that peak. It's And so when we talk about spending a lot of time in stage two, you know, we're not talking about getting all this stuff out before there's a demo because you know, that that Diana brought up. Right? They they wanna see the product. The end of the day, we are talking about a product. The solution is and and so just that idea here of This isn't gonna go linearly. Right? This is gonna be a a bunch of little mini cycles that happened within the macro cycle and, you know, talk about spending most of our time at stage two, That doesn't mean we're gonna spend all of our time in stage two before we go wanna to do this other stuff that this is something... We keep coming back to and keep coming back to and keep coming back to Well, the existing customers you've done two for multiple years.

Client 3: Potentially. Right? I mean, you've had the vin you can continue to get business from them. I I hear what you're saying. We may wanna consider Hamilton Indiana in our groups, how familiar they are Dia, you said they're are very familiar with an offering that they're asking for signature capture. But if it's new and they're not familiar with how to use it, we may wanna go back. Back to the beginning and just like your tax attorney, or you're the weather person will tell you, it depends. Right? And we do wanna have fluidity. We wanna have an understanding of what they know before we try and go back and ask questions that might sound silly to somebody who understands what it looks like, But I'll always default to make sure they understand the value of what we're bringing before the demo or the pricing. But here we are in stage three qualified As we do with each of your stages, what's the customer doing They're discussing requirements with vendors at this point. We are summarizing that the beating summary reset with the champion is accurate. And the champion by definition can introduce us to the decision maker. So then we're getting access to key players and we're updating the Crm. And the selling skills are accessing key players is the new skill Dia, you alluded to this previously, making sure we're getting to the right person, But then we're doing the same thing in three is discovering analyzing needs developing solutions with value. And we're using the same tools. So as we go through and do that, next slide, please validate. Just illustrative We spoke to Steven Str park. Now we gotta go speak to those other two key players. Now we got to get in and talk to those other two key players and we're gonna do that. Through the use of the discovery map, of course. So the next exercise that we do in the full work shop is called getting access to key players. You're asking for access from those key players. We're not gonna do that exercise today. But Bonnie, if you go to page fifty seven to two pages. Beg your pardon backup up one. There you go So here is a variety of different ways at the bottom of fifty seven to ask for access to the other key players. You did ask at the end of the discovery conversation, who else should be involved? And they gave you names. Now, We've set the meeting summary. We're gonna ask for access to those key players. So, Gary, if you would on fifty seven, right next to ask for access this is a very direct way to ask. Would you just read the words next to ask for access please?

Client 5: Sure. I'll need to meet with the decision maker, can you arrange an introduction?

Client 3: K. So that's one way and then the next way is to tell them Please read those words Sure.

Client 5: In order to completely understand the issues from everybody's perspective, I need to meet with all the other key players. If I don't, the solution might miss the mark. Can you arrange those meetings?

Client 3: And then company policy Would you read Dave Company policy for the words next to it?

Client 11: It's company policy that we need with your decision maker before we move on. Before we move forward.

Client 3: Is a company policy that you meet with decision makers? Should it be company policy? And then last one is peer to peer. Dave Please read those words. You're muted My Ceo wants to meet your Ceo Can you help me arrange that And and you'll notice Ceos at brackets.

Client 3: So that could be anybody else on your team. Doesn't have to be Larry. It could be by technical specialist, my product manager, My whomever wants to me, Can you help me to arrange those meetings? So it's different ways that we ask for access. And there's three different answers that they could give us When we ask for access? What's the first one that they could give us what we ask for access? What could they say?

Client 11: Yes.

Client 3: They could say yes and then run for run Go go have those discovery map conversations with the other key players Fantastic you're What else could they say Hello Yes.

Client 3: They could say no, I'm in the Department of sales prevention, We do not let sales in you give the information to me and I'll run it up the flagpole pulled to the powers that be. I have no idea what that last statement means. But I know it means you're not getting it. Or so David yes or no. We're fairly binary at this point or they could say, do you wanna talk to them about? They give you some push pushback. And you'll be shocked in maze that we have words for you to use when they say, do you wanna talk to them about? So let's go to the next page melanie. They wanna know what do you wanna talk to them about? Why are you hesitant to introduce me do you wanna talk to them about? So if you would Dean, can you read for us the words next to justification Your muted.

Client 13: Without input from the decision maker, My proposal may miss the mark. In my experience, his her perspective is important you introduce me?

Client 3: And then Drew, will you read for us fly on the wall.

Client 6: You're muted?

Client 3: True There you go.

Client 10: That's three three four three. I'm concerned that during your meetings with key players they may inquire about the capabilities we have discussed. Could avoid any misunderstandings if I were present to clarify any questions that may come up about our product and services. My company you at that meeting.

Client 3: And then Jody, would you read our last one please bargain for access? Down at the bottom half it says I understand. Please.

Client 4: I understand that I may be premature to speak with the others. But if I offer proof and you are satisfied where you introduce me?

Client 3: What do you think of that? Is that fair? That last one I offer you proof a demo, whatever it is a reference, Will you introduce me?

Client 10: So it's you're pretty much put in all the reservations to bed.

Client 3: Hoping to Hope to Drew. So It's not if I get pushed back, it's when I get pushed back. You will get pushed back and asking for access to key players. And I'm not suggesting you read this like a script whether it's the ask of the handling pushback, but this is one of the other exercises that we do, which is critical in opportunity development because if you don't get to the decision maker, What might happen? What might happen if you don't get access to the decision maker?

Client 11: Won't get i get a bad suppression.

Client 10: Yeah. You want to decision You might be like an episode of seinfeld where nothing happens And I'm not saying it's the end of the sales cycle but your probability of success goes down.

Client 3: And I'd like I'd love to tell you I always get access to the decision maker it's not true. It's best to start with the decision maker because you shorten the sales cycle. But we gotta ask. If we don't start with the decision maker, we don't ask, what's the answer? No So we gotta ask, this is another exercise that we do. If during your opportunity development, you find yourself getting stuck, This is a great role play to do with your manager. It's very simple. You can go to pages fifty seven fifty eight or melody. Please go to fifty nine. That's where we've put both on the same page. Oh, know. It's the... What after that. Beg your pardon and there it is right there on page sixty. The ask and how they handle the pushback So that's there for your reference to use. Any thoughts or come on asking for access or handling the pushback. Alright So Us for access, and in our workshop Everything just happens beautifully, of course, right, Moly page sixty one, down a couple slides there it is. You asked for access, You got access and you go in. And you have those conversations with all the key players. You got meeting summaries and you're ready to go. You're ready to go from the buyers phase one, solution development into their evaluation. We're headed into the buyers phase two And the next page or two pages for now sixty three The buyers phase two is called evaluation.

Client 3: And you're finally ready to send a quote or a proposal pretty exciting time. Isn't it? It's We've been holding out on them for four and a half hours. Now we're ready to go. What's the most important thing to the buyer in Phase two? Phase one was their business objective. What's the most important thing to the buyer in phase two? To quiz. On page six. Open book quiz. Proof. Who said prove, dean? Better proof that your capabilities match what.

Client 9: Their Pb o.

Client 3: Their videos It we're it's hard to match him. If we don't know what they are, so we gotta match him up. We gotta match him up. We're going into the evaluation they went out. They got three quotes or three bids or three Rf i's, Or Rfp, some companies will send out seven or eight Rfp I don't think they'd look at all of them by the way, but they do. I think that's to justify the job of the person issuing the Rfp.

Client 3: And you're laughing dean you could you cry also as well as last for just been there on that.

Client 13: That's why I was left.

Client 3: It's a little justification there. Oh, we sent out eight rfp. Dean Do you own that house that you're in right now?

Client 13: I do.

Client 3: How many houses did you look at when you bought that one in that area?

Client 13: Six zero eight, How many did you have inspected just this one.

Client 3: One. How many will the buyer really look at? Not a You looked at six or eight, right, dean, you want to get a feel, Yep. What you wanted location blah blah, but you had one inspected. Buyers are very predictable. And that's good. Right? We all do that. We get them inspected. So we're headed into the evaluation. Some you will be thrilled and now talk about proceed and your capabilities And put together the proposal, the three ring binder, the health font that's very soothing to the eyes that you're producing those proposals odd And oftentimes if you don't have a plan For when you deliver the proposal, things can get very strange. And by the way, the selling scale here is managing the prospects decision process. Before we give them the quote, we wanna know what criteria will they use? To select the winner, And what's the timeline? Because if you don't do that, Sometimes things get dragged out. Does anybody have a quote that's out been out too long. Or proposal? Out past it's... It's natural length of life anybody had one out there too long? How long vanessa is it put out there?

Client 1: Is too long not announcing.

Client 3: Yes. Longer than the gestation period of an elephant, how long is it been out there?

Client 1: Four months.

Client 3: Four months. What was it supposed to close?

Client 1: End of this year, I guess. Yeah. December December of twenty twenty two or did they just say December?

Client 1: They never really said. Not.

Client 3: And that's why Hence why hence why you're here, and I'm here and we're doing this.

Client 3: Here we are. Somehow we lost that loving feeling and between four months ago, August and now, what happened?

Client 1: Nobody knows.

Client 3: So on the next page, I do this fun exercise we I'm not gonna do where I would have vanessa call me. I go to sixty four melanie please. And didn't asked me any of these ridiculous questions If you wanna ask me one or two for vanessa go ahead.

Client 1: How do you get them to answer the phone?

Client 3: Dean knows how to do that. He'll talk to you about it after her training.

Client 3: But go ahead ask me.

Client 1: Yeah. Sure. Hey. How how is it going?

Client 3: Hey it's going great. I love that proposal the three ring binder your meeting summary. I like you the best.

Client 1: There's action on that? That's it.

Client 3: Very slow action vanessa.

Client 3: I thought I thought it would close in August, but here we are we're like a a glacier around here slow. Yeah Are you the you're reading the prospect.

Client 3: Right? Yes. I'm being the Okay.

Client 3: one more question. Go ahead ask me.

Client 1: Of the should What should I tell my manager?

Client 3: That you're not that you're not very good at forecasting deals. That's what I would tell. So you see what's happening. So before we give the proposal the next slide, please. Thought you're gonna ask me to lunch virtual lunch there, vanessa.

Client 3: When it comes time to select the vendor, I'm going to ask the customer, and yes, bet dia end, understand with existing customers we've got a stream of business with it could be a different approach. Right? I totally get that. When it comes to to selected vendor, what's the process that you will use to make a decision? Ask them this. Because you can use the buyers process the competitors process or your process. And I hope you see the value in the letter. What did they need to see from you and what do you wanna see from that? I know what you wanna see from them. Doc. Right, Jody, I think you just slipped the signature Po. Of course. What criteria will they use to select a decision? To make a decision What's their timeline? Do they need an implementation plan and I don't want to under state this because some of you have had to go through that onboard. Dean you're shaking your head again. Right? It to It, you're ripping out one. You're putting another. There's training. One line doesn't do a justice. And if you have it spoken to those people during opportunity development asked to speak to them mail. Before you send the proposal. And if they agree to say sure you can talk to them. What does that tell you? Or if they say no, I don't want you to talk to them. What does that tell you? If they say yes, go ahead and talk to them now, What does that tell you?

Client 10: But serious they're serious.

Client 3: They're series or drew they say easy spark relax to send us the quote, we'll let you know. So as for approximate timelines for each of event and let them know that you will draft them a tie You will draft them a timeline. This is you giving them something and saying, here's how you buy for me. This is you asking that what would they like to say? So Melody, please go to page sixty six. And here's an example of the evaluation tie. Here are the different events that happen, and the dates that they happen on. Will the dates change as you go through a six month sales cycle? Of course, they will. Of course, they will. So put a draft up at the upper left hand corner of what the date is. Want a reference some product info. They want a demo, They wanna do a site visit They wanna get a quote you see the different events that are going through here what both sides will do? We wanna get a date where they're gonna start where they're gonna kick off. And can you start with that date and work backwards?

Client 3: When off, you mean, like, on for in our cases, like go live on our product.

Client 3: Go live.

Client 2: And if you saying that's that's... We want them because our customers don't get to technically control that. There's other teams that decide that are you just saying we wanna at least know what their goal is?

Client 3: Yes. Find out their window. I understand that one point a couple years ago, you guys were backed up. I mean, you just had a time going So as them their window. I'm not saying this is not contractual. This is not a commitment. So how many people on their team are involved in selecting and installing the system, how many would you say? Say you have three key players Who else is involved on their side? Who else? What function is involved? Dean, who else is involved on the buyer side? In their organization.

Client 13: Ceo Cfo and service manager Who else Anybody else?

Client 3: It Accounts payable, Is legal involved? Do you ever have to do a legal Is there? A legal review, Worst thing in the world is when you win a piece of business and they go oh, we have to send it legal. Because legal bills by the hour. There's no hurry. Who has one in their family I have three in my family. How can this help them? And then How many involved on our side. You your manager, Somebody from technical Accounts receivable. Contracts, how do we get visibility into this before we win the business And I'm not saying that there's always nine steps which are here. There could be three. It's smaller transactional stuff boom boom longer and stuff could be longer. But if they are willing to build this with you, and I hope it's between the decision maker and the seller because then you're submitting the proposal So you see contract approval on April twentieth, And then a timeline has established again. I think that was considered here. Right? And then you begin the implementation six months later, because you guys are pushed out. In many circumstances, which as long as you set their expectations, we're good So you go in on April first, and you do the preliminary proposal quotation and you walk them through everything. Do you do this Two years ago a different answer, But are you doing this face to face on good sized deals that you getting in with them and going through it. Or do did you just send it to? What do you do?

Client 9: We like you now.

Client 1: Yeah. Currently been just doing it over you know, via the Internet teams or Zoom or whatever.

Client 1: And think it's starting to change Good.

Client 3: Because we wanna get with them, and we wanna go through everything that's in the quote. And I know I haven't touched any of that. Right? You guys have technical acumen, you have tees and c's and your agreements that all need to be covered. If you get in there, And you're talking here to the Cfo, the service manager. They agree with everything that they see During the review of the proposal, If they agree with everything, what should you do? In that meeting.

Client 13: Ask per signature.

Client 11: Ask for the business Dan Wright dean, This is not the used car salesman asking you a second question.

Client 3: What do I have to do to get you in a car today? You've built your credibility. You've sent meeting summaries, you pulling it together, You walk them through if they like everything they see can we move this opportunity forward today? And what can they say to that question? Three potential. There's always three. There's three of everything. What could they say to that? Yeah. That's it.
