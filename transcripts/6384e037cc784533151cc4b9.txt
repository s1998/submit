Host 1: Merry.

Host 1: Yeah. It's going it's Monday. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. Very much. That's it's it's not the feeling over here as well.

Host 1: If feels like, it's bright and early, but it's eleven o'clock already. Was how's your thanksgiving overall. Like, that was the weekend and everything.

Client 2: Yeah. It was really nice. It was nice to just go did some like friday shopping.

Host 1: Got my Yeah.

Client 2: I got her and I a nice necklace so excited to get back to her. How are you?

Host 1: Yeah. I I did some online shopping and then I didn't go the actual stores. Did you go into the actual stores or did you just know, wake up bright early.

Client 2: I I did. I did. I got her some jewelry. I I wanted to go take a look at it. Before more purchasing anything. But that I I have one to be honest.

Host 1: That is That is cool.

Client 2: Yeah. A big big cyber Monday guy. Opposed to Black Friday. But the stores weren't as as routed it as I remember than being... I haven't I haven't gone black Friday and quite some time to be honest. So like I What I was there, it's... Like, I I could find parking, which I think was a good surprise because i we're going in the past and never be able to find parking. Hi.

Client 3: Hey. Are you?

Client 2: Good. How are you doing?

Client 3: Hi, Lee. How are you?

Host 1: Yeah I'm good. Just talking about Black Friday shopping in Cyber Monday, for the holidays here.

Client 3: Oh my god. Any exciting purchases?

Host 1: I I haven't but it sounds like Merry Merry's has been productive there.

Client 2: Yeah. I got like girlfriend a nice necklace. So excited to give back to her. For Christmas.

Client 3: Nice.

Host 1: That's not. How many is is it Merry with you too?

Client 2: Like, two and a half almost three.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Getting up there.

Client 2: Yeah. So about time to start, start rolling out the jewelry and you know, some some some nicer gifts than I've probably given in the past. So This was a pretty thoughtful one.

Host 1: Nice.

Client 2: Okay. Well, yeah. Just wanted to bring everyone together to say real quick on eve wealth because I know just with being out and also just with their pilot, there's been a few questions That have arise, so just wanted to get everyone together to discuss it a little bit further.

Client 3: Yeah. So Just so I understand that lead, you you were managing the sales process. Yeah. Right. Okay. Cool. And then they Where did it come up that they wanted a thousand opt ins? Was that in onboarding? Or is that So at some point, in the sales process, Yeah.

Host 1: They mentioned in the sales process. They mentioned it's we exited quite a bit of back and forth for negotiations on their contracts, like, I was... I was actually a bit surprised at how much we're coming back and forth in that they didn't want this. A thousand minimum they wanted a ninety day, and they wanted a sixty day opt out they wanted a thousand people as a minimum to, you know, in order to to move forward, basically, said that's not necessarily the best milestone for us to have to to judge a good onboarding. So we get them down to a thirty day I think we waived our onboarding fee, but they did bring it up there. And then she brought up again, it's in we're very or from our thousand onboarding fee, like, just a couple days ago. And I said, yeah. That's a great internal milestone to have. But again, that's not you know, necessarily the best number for us to judge whether this is you know, a useful long term strategy for engagement. So it's something they're measuring. But we don't hold into that.

Client 3: Seems pretty arbitrary. Do you know how they arrived at a thousand. Like, is that the point where they think that they get an Roi on it or is it just Did do we have any under, like, a basis for that number?

Host 1: It seems like it's their arbitrary metric. So they have one ten ten thousand people. I right might yeah ten thousand people. So they're thinking, you know, ten percent opt in, you know, if we get to a thousand, I think again, a bit of an arbitrary on their end.

Client 3: Got it. And were they So Usually, it is hard to get, like, higher group. Just by the nature of the product, we get lower opt offense. Did we talk about that with them in the beginning.

Host 1: Zero.

Client 3: Merry, did you share that with them in the onboarding call? At all.

Client 2: Not that necessarily there were higher opt ins, but we did talk about on onboarding weather to do group or one on one, and we we land on group. Mainly because a lot of the topics they discussed they, we're gonna be a little more better official two roll out to the group. Size of things, but we didn't... That's necessarily say, like, hey the often percentages are better for one on one.

Client 3: Mh. Okay. So I think... And so their it sounds like they're not Like how then on just doing group, they would be open to doing one one yes.

Client 2: From my onboarding, maybe open doing one on one based upon the scored we have and sort of my thought on this pilot if we were to extend the pilot is... And I think you and I kinda touched on this little Galadriel is doing the one on one explaining to them that, you know, a better chance of higher often rates just because it's a little bit more of established process for us. Also, I think we encourage them to send emails from the top form as well, which is something they weren't doing. This time, around and we encourage them to do the nudge that they're doing with the email program that they've used for the first. Engagement, which I believe is is mailchimp. So the reason why they send emails The first time is because they have a a a program that gives some insights on like, open rates. And I think we use that in tandem with orbit. Emails this time instead of only, you know, relying on them to send the mailchimp.

Client 3: Mh. Do you think we could make the case late and put them on a six month contract and then they could have five more or forty five more matching rounds and in those rounds, we can then see how many unique users opted in. And maybe that would get us into Well, a, would get us into a longer term commitment with them, and they would have more matching rounds to, like, evaluate orbit on. B if for example, like, somebody couldn't opt in last month because just like wasn't good timing with them because of the holidays and whatnot, but they're able to in January or February then we have a true image of, like, the overall percentage. Of people who opted in through first time and super users.

Host 1: So we would offer a six month contract because we we don't think they're gonna renew.

Client 3: Yeah. I don't think they're in now.

Host 1: We don't think they're gonna renew because their options are low.

Client 3: They didn't they ask for an extension?

Host 1: Extension. Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. So So we think what is, like, less than one percent of their ten thousand? Essentially as the opt rate. And we can't we can't track that right because they're not using our platform. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. Correct. Yeah. We can just go based on the numbers they're telling us they sent them to, which is okay. So if ten k is a number where Yeah. We're we're about at one percent. Yeah.

Host 1: I mean, one percent... Who knows what their open rated and stuff like that. But I mean, do we think that's low? Yeah.

Client 3: That's very low. That... That's slow. I honestly i think in addition to all the areas that Merry said we can improve on group only really works in communities that orbit is already established in. And they're already aware, like, one one matching, got it. They knows sequence know process it's communicated in every single programming touch that they have with community, Those are the instances where group works. Really well. I think one percent for one one is really bad. One... One percent for group. I is really bad. That's about. Yeah.

Client 3: Oh, yeah. I think if we can move him over to I mean, I I definitely think that they if we don't give an extension that it would just not renew.

Host 1: After their sixty days even you mean, No.

Client 2: Like, doing one job date.

Client 2: Right.

Host 1: Right now like the thirty day as it's standards right now.

Host 1: Right? Oh you're saying. Sure you're saying so instead of extending them an extra to thirty days, just off them a six months contract.

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: It seems like they wouldn't take it. Right?

Client 3: I know.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: I mean, we can go in and offer that to them. And then as, like, like, back pocket, we maybe then offer like, accommodate the extension. Because I think either way, we need to the extension? But I think it it's really more of how hard do we wanna go in to sell the six month contract before just a dating the extension I think is is Also, maybe more of the the scope could we and if we could convince them to not just look at it as, like, the results of a single matching round, but the results of six or five matching rounds and how many what percentage of their population opted in to the pool of engagements that we're running.

Host 1: I think that's the biggest thing.

Host 1: Yeah. We they're they're looking at it. As, like, the short term one k milestone that they need hit to say we're valuable tool. But I mean, they have think they're a paid membership. Right? And they have other things where, you know, maybe this group mentioned that they've done to their one percent does a lot of things for their other events for programs that we're not aware of, you know, So like, there is probably some value there for them. And then also, our we to do one two one in it maybe instead of group matching, like, on a monthly basis, are they only group matching for, like, the entire annual contracts? Like could we, like, flip it either or sometimes?

Client 2: So that's supposed to be on on premium. It may have access to both.

Client 3: It's like ideally supposed to be either warren.

Client 2: I think the idea of, like, flipping it here is to like, entice seven show them value on like, show them what value they would receive on either end of product and I ideally course them into the one that is going to, you know, yield them more value because it'll be more likely for hook for them to renew, but they'll ultimately have to make that decision. I think that would be the idea of, like, offering to one on this right Not necessarily, like, giving them the option to, like, flip. Any time, just to make a decision. And and then and then maybe maybe the answer to is, like, like you said, like, maybe where we're under selling the value that they might find of the one percent, like, to your point, and then maybe that bad prompts and an urge to upgrade the premium because they have access to both. You know, Like, that that that's a scenario that could happen as well. It's I'll be maybe a more likely one if we're sitting here thinking that they might not renew at all to think that maybe they they would upgrade, but nonetheless, it is an option know, that could happen. It's a it's a scenario, Have you have you seen the emails that they sent out for this group matching?

Host 1: Did they share that content with you?

Client 2: So what they did is is they took the they took the verbiage off of our our templates and then just personalized it to, like, the e wealth branding. And added in just like, a little bit about about why they're running lease programs, which is kinda like the standard practice for kind of first engagement. So it it it's pretty basic to what we recommend them sending.

Host 1: So they basically could just copied our template and put it into their Esp they can track your better correct because they can track, like, open rates and where we're really just like, tracking bounced unsubscribe.

Client 2: So...

Host 1: They're getting a lot.

Host 1: It's not like they're they're costing this in a newsletter or something with a bunch of other updates. Like, it's a dedicated email message to all of their members.

Client 2: It it is it is going in a a newsletter in, like, the community wide be... Like, it's they're following all the forms of touch. But instead of doing the two So we always recommend three to four at at least. So instead of getting there to touches out of the platform. That they would only have to then do to the themselves. They're doing all three to four of them themselves. With their Esp and one being the newsletter. Which is is pretty much how we recommend doing it, I think my recommendation is still used the Esp, but let's also leverage orbit of emails as well just to know. Really make sure we're evaluating the full tool okay.

Host 1: So Maybe Galadriel to your to your point on offering a six of the contracts. I mean, love to chat with Joy. I mean, one joy is pretty cool, if she open. I've never talked to a lot of the Ceo. Although she's in all the emails she never says words. So don't I can't gauge him what those conversations are internally, but I think when the renewal comes up, or when this this Review session comes up, Merry, I think in December right, of joy and see what she says like, one...

Host 1: Okay. What are you thinking about this on renewal? And if it's not where you expected to be? And you so you think we should go down from there what's the number? And then let's just hit be prepared with, like, a bottom that we're going to go on. If that's annual or if that is the six month as like it contingency, think we should have that kind of in our pocket. I think that might be a good way to go. But I wanna see what she's thinking directly.

Client 3: Okay. I think the... It expires next week. Right?

Client 3: Is the fourteenth.

Client 2: Yeah. The fourteenth. Yeah. They had... It's either the twelfth or the fourteenth third their pilot ends and then we have the... I have the feedback call with them on the x.

Client 3: Okay. Why are you add of that call? Because they won't be able to get another matching around in between now and when that it expires.

Client 2: And so where we sort of left things off with their Last two extent right now is that we're we're discussing internally and going to come back to them with Sorry. I just I just added Petunia. With with either like, a proposal or a solution So how do you think we just now the the the holiday we can deliver I'm sure they're they're eager for at least some sort of response per us how...

Client 3: stations happening? Is it this week?

Client 2: I believe they're happening on this second in. Let me double check I believe. It's on the second without Going shrink the memory here. So, yes, they're doing the December first and second and kind spanning from seven Am to around noon because it's it's bigger products. So scheduling is a little bit different. So December first and second, Okay.

Client 3: Maybe we what do you think about this late? Just saying, let's just see you know, how conversations go, get all the feedback in, and then we could talk about renewal on that feedback call on the sixth.

Host 1: Yeah. I think that's good. I think letting her know that we're gonna have that discussion on the sixth is Yeah. The most important part.

Client 3: Yeah. And then hopefully, you get a little bit ammo from, like, testimonials or any feedback that you're getting. To, like, support that conversation? And I don't think they would want to schedule engagement this week anyway, Right, Merry?

Client 2: No. No. No. They're they're going to They talked about wanting to set something up and that's why I'm I'm get getting them back, My knowledge wouldn't be kicking off this week could be kicking off. You know, like, the second or third after.

Client 3: Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Just let her know that you'll talk about renewal on that. After we get all the feedback. And...

Host 1: Do Do we have feedback yet? On the workspace?

Client 2: No. Because no conversations have happened. So those will start trickling in problems like seven eight Am on the first.

Host 1: Okay. So So hopefully, we get conversations and some feedback and, yeah, that could go into that meeting with that qualitative feedback Yeah.

Client 2: Because I I know they send it to ten k, but ideally, like, ninety five with ninety five off days or should at least be Hopefully, we get at least. You know, twenty percent of those folks leaving feedback. So there should be at least like, you know, eight or so testimonials to share. Hopefully, they're they're relatively positive to help push forward.

Client 3: Yeah. K. Sounds like a plan. Yeah. I'm I'm a little worried about one this one seems like it's Not great. But Yeah.

Host 1: I mean, Yeah. You're you're seeing this with group it's a bit lower. Number one. And then it's also low for options on their list of ten thousand I think the biggest things I called a you feedback. If we get good feedback, good conversations. We think this and ramp up dividend and engagements have the done for? Just one Merry.

Client 2: Just one, and then they have another one in in the platform that they went to start just kinda looks like they're starting to formulate the the matching questions on.

Client 3: Okay.

Host 1: The best thing that can happen, the best thing can happen is that second engagement has a a little bit more of an opt in and then we can show like it's trending upwards it's a reason for them too continue and if we have good feedback, Yeah. I don't I don't think we necessarily if that happens come down from our agreement. We had to sell them on. The long term value Yep.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. By way have the plan on that one.

Host 1: Galadriel real quick. If we were to go down to, like, a six month something where where does that leave us? Like, in terms of numbers? Like, what was you suggest there?

Client 3: In terms of what they amount.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: They're are an eight k annual right now.

Host 1: Yep.

Client 3: It would be just four k for six months.

Host 1: So you just cut in half.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, if you wanted to go try and go higher, it sounds like they're very price changes. So and stubborn. We could try and go a little bit higher for a six month contract, but I think just trying to get them onto something more long term. What be better than just doing, like, one month, one month, one month and keeping the can down the road.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. Sounds good.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. Thank you.

Host 1: Thank you.
