Client 3: I was I was on a cold call is trying to explain to prospect what exactly it is we do. But he's a he said he was too small not a big deal for at the moment, but sorry about being like, Oh, no worries.

Client 1: If that's... You could just like ping and be like, hey on phone.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 1: That's that's I mean, that's the name of the game.

Client 1: Yeah. They're calling.

Client 3: I tried to put him in the squeeze He said no right off the bat. And he's like, no, we don't need we don't it covered. We don't need it. So I tried to explain what revenue share is to. And that he's like, well my customers don't pay shipping cover... For any insurance like I'm sure they do. Like, even if it's a shipping cost, how they easy, they just pay shipping. Like, yeah. There's coverage. So you're paying Ups or ground. And how that works, and I just I don't I'll won't go into, because I know you guys but I explained to him how that work. I explained to him what we do. And he's like, oh, we're just too small. It's not a big deal. It's like He just... It was high may have missed to Mark, but just, I guess I didn't prevent presenting enough value to him. But on the next.

Client 1: Yeah. Soogrim. I haven't I been tried this out. Why thing I thought of is When when that type of situation comes up, like, if if they're we don't know that they're weren't that but they are sit on let him know. Like, hey. Yeah, like one of our your customers who don't really have like, a heavy volume up to point where they're getting a lot of claims, and the reason they use it is either just to give their customers peace of mind because there some data that ties into sharing that in increases what the different conversion rates. Or just as an additional revenue stream.

Client 3: That's right. Yeah. I know the Topper said that he goes I tried to switch the conversation to a customer experience. And I know, man, that's such a great pivot. And that's what you just explained. You're like, yeah, It's just it's it's the... It's the the comfort of knowing that my is just going to be here. It's... And it's gonna to be on time. And I'm not gonna have to deal with any issues. So the customer experience is outstanding.

Client 1: Yeah. Exactly At the end of day. It's optional. But yep.

Client 3: Cool.

Client 1: I'm pulling a new batch for, you know, some bigger need leads. Now it's the new starting in you know, we don't not looking for ones that are more than likely so looks like in a month. Know?

Client 1: Okay. One. One second is fine. So Okay.

Client 1: Hopefully, that should be less of an objection.

Client 3: Yep.

Client 1: And How how was... I guess, how is the past day, you know, past thirty six hours gonna you guys as far as just like talking to people in the me year not time when everyone said, hey to call us back because well, be less busy. And like next, we talk about it. I'm just curious how Like, subjective at least. I know that the that I can look into, but how you guys are feeling like about the sentiment?

Client 3: Yeah. I feel good about everything. Kinda changed up my pitch a little bit. So i had some success yesterday with that. Actually just have better success overall speaking with people with a new page. Not very much different. Just couple words that I think have been beneficial. And I'm still following up with prospects from q four. Some of them are not answering, but I think once we get them on the phone, we can know, him on the calendar and share what O can do for them.

Client 1: Okay. No. I mean, that's that's fine. It's like, it's part of the Chase.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 1: I guess, the part of the reason for the job and then Going to. Oh, I'm thinking I know you were doing some you know, you've been doing some linkedin prospecting has anything come of that from like just directly messaging people.

Client 3: Yeah. I've had some good conversations with them. So I what I typically do is I add every prospect how Kelly said she kinda goes over things because there's a there's a link right there. Right in front of the prospects, just the high in. So I just click that boom and it heads over. So this guy's name is Joseph and I always go down and I make sure to connect with And sometimes I'm reaching out to prospects who have not answered the phone at all. And I realized I'm actually connected with them. So right. Yeah. Once I I connected with them, but they haven't answered any not phone calls. I sent him a message like, hey. I just wanna let you know I've been reaching out to you on some cold calls would love to... you know, then I say, hey, Just I message you on here would be a little easier to connect because it's like a text message now. You know. And so I was like, hey, you know, I'd love to kinda share what we do at Op and how we can be a good fit or you know, x y z company just love to have five ten minutes of your time. So we are just starting off that. I just noticed that today. That was like, first message that I sent today because I noticed that was connected with a few people after over the break, you know, they accepted my invite, and now that I'm cycling back through, shot a couple messages. So, you know, fingers crossed and hopefully we can get some interactions from them.

Client 1: That's nice. Tell, what about year end?

Client 4: I wanna access to that. Can we have to sales number?

Client 4: I wanna access to that. Give me that you know is linkedin things.

Client 1: You mean linkedin in sales navigator?

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 4: Yeah. Actually do need to access to that. But But however you can message people because I can't message anybody on Linkedin.

Client 1: Oh, i. Yeah. Let me I know we were like looking at that for a team.

Client 3: Oh, yeah. That's that's just something I pay separately, Kelly. Just payout out a pocket for it.

Client 1: Were talking about that getting that like, complete wide and deceptive question.

Client 1: More executive looking at it. And so he knows you should still send me the issues you have because I can probably try to get that for you in the time.

Client 3: Oh, okay. Yeah. That'd would be awesome. I'll I'll send it over today then But yeah, kelly, what it is is I just pay a premium. For Linkedin. And what it is is I get fifty in emails So each month it will reset. But you don't have to be connected to the prospect now and you can send the messages So sometimes I'll just create templates or snippets and my outreach. And then I'll just copy and paste and send it over to every person that I prospect with on Linkedin. And and you'll... And sometimes it's a ghost town, but It's just the extra way to get in front of your prospects. Right? So now you have email whole call and now you have Linkedin in. So it can be beneficial sometimes.

Client 4: It's they get all that. I get all that.

Client 4: Okay. You don't aft you know October explain. The only thing I want is, like, texts system. Do we... There's like some message system on this outreach thing.

Client 1: So how we used to have a text message capability and they kinda just discontinued to which is annoying...

Client 1: Yeah. I don't know why they did that. So I'm I know text messages definitely help. I think, like, right now the way that than that as people use them text message and it's kind of can and puppy and and pasted it? Unfortunately. So, like, text messages is still definitely valuable. I just don't know that we have an automation system. For at the moment. It's like it's something on the... That kinda do golden and export because I I thought it was helpful uploaded I don't know why i started, but we just don't have We don't have like...

Client 4: We don't have.

Client 4: That's just It's okay. We don't have it. That's just my my biggest dream.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: You know, I mean, there's there's no reason not to as long as you're comfortable using a phone not to send people, like text messages.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: There's there's some where There's definitely some like, some targets. There. And I get a lot of reporting success Yes.

Client 1: I'm I'm all aware of anyone wants trying interesting out there. I'll probably do some testing myself. Once. With some of these more enterprise campaigns About building out once just can i get the at least the need of the boundary sitting? So thought you my take on it.

Client 4: Yeah. They're in those small demands I am feeling kinda sick. I've been feeling sick over the things So just been slow. As usual. I think I'm only at You know how many dials but i'm at sixteen prospects. Probably like forty dials. I don't know. Slow day, We'll pick later though.

Client 1: Yeah. I mean, there's still probably this... We might still be a little slow these first days because people are getting back to the holidays and they're doing there. That catch up exercises.

Client 1: Yeah. Sir.

Client 4: I'm just slow in general. Like, I'm just tired and, like, Moving slowly, like a worm I just keep getting distracted I think I just drank too much coffee or something.

Client 1: Coffee should be the opposite that so just make sure. Make sure doing your your coffee does and and Morris.

Client 4: Maybe I got a dose up. You know, how when you drink it too much, and then you get, like, let. Like, maybe I have to add another level...

Client 1: That's just gonna make it worse. That just sounds like a crash. And you need to do, like Okay.

Client 1: Like stretch and get like a healthy. I don't know. Probably. Like some a this in test.

Client 4: Some eggs. Oh, that sounds delicious.
