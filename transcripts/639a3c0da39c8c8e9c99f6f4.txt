Client 1: four months. I know the humans.

Host 2: Single gonna get to that Yeah.

Host 3: But his bot joined this meeting.

Host 2: Oh, that's funny. So that means that technically, he can listen to this meeting up there hey keith?

Host 3: Yeah. That's an interesting the use case I never thought about. Like, you could potentially not join a meeting. And have your bot. You you're sending a steward in you're in your instead, basically. I will be recording this meeting from afar.

Host 2: Well, That's right. You know, I was I was just churning about this with the every cup in Jebediah like, By And more more wondering about, like, the horizontal will use dizzy here of of this product. Right? Because, like, I mean, I as a manager, I love this idea of, like, I have this like, bio host channel well, imagine I had like a summary of every meeting in the company. Like that removes every single bottleneck, like, communication and collaboration and coordination bottleneck inside company. Right. So I can I can just like... In ten minutes, I can catch up on, like, everything that's happening in inside my company and, like, Josh and me all this deciding to do this and like like, wait a minute I not language Like a tell about it. That that could be huge. And then, I mean, again, like, all of the knowledge of the company happens inside meetings. So like, technically, like, to me like, the wiki... like, the job to be done of a wiki to, like, like a creates knowledge, but like, it's it's a it's it's absolutely to the moment you've created it. Right? You don't need a wiki if you've got a batch that sits on every single meeting and understands the content. You literally don't need a anymore. Like, you can just ask questions to that but. So, hey, like, how do we do that around here? Or whatever.

Host 3: Mean, I think it's really, like, each day, you know. You basically I don't know. It's like the meeting repository is more of, like a live overview of your company. At any given time.

Host 2: Yeah.

Host 3: Which is pretty. Mean, actually, like, I didn't thought kinda about that. But like, as a Ceo or just higher ups. Like, imagine you just like, kind of like each at the end of the day, you get like, and then you can respond. Be like, all all these people are trying to make all these options. Right? Tomorrow, we're gonna do things a little differently change it up. And then it just, like cascade down and then you don't have to attend all the meetings, you can focus us on stuff.

Host 2: Yes. And also I mean... And I I think it'd be only one that very but. I would like to coach i reports on, like, no meetings. Like, I would love to be able to have like that. Like, if like, look at the one in one between like, Eugene and their reboots. Like, maybe the wheels they're like be able to recommend. Like, hey, man, like I think you should've have handled that differently. Like, right I think that's valuable as well. Like why it salespeople be the only ones receiving coaching?

Host 3: Yeah. you do get into this weird big brother.

Host 2: I yeah. It's even multi broader in.

Host 2: But I I feel I feel like you make it use to it. Have you heard a... I I assume the all of a right value?

Host 3: Yeah.

Host 2: They do that. Every meeting is recording, they have like, it's it's a bit of a crazy system that they have, but The companies would probably be like, look, it's you know, these meetings are...

Host 3: Everything is opened by default.

Host 2: I I love the idea.

Host 2: And and.

Host 3: Fuck. I mean, I wanna I want... Like, you can't have Hr meetings or whatever. You know, at there and you have to have a permission system that was pretty tight, I think got.

Host 2: Yeah, you can always opt out. Right? Like, only about it is like, I mean, when we talk about it like that, I love it, but then there is no horizontal original meeting management need this assessment.

Host 3: Not what. Has people tried to do it.

Host 2: Yeah. There's been lot people who tried to do it and other other people who succeeded. Let me show you something.

Host 3: Have they tried to do it with, like, the way we're doing it? Like, you take all Zoom meetings and then you're just able to No.

Host 2: There has been no company that plugs it into Ai. Right? And those all that like Ai magic stuff.

Host 3: Right.

Host 2: But then I also won't if one of these things where it's like, you know, when you talk about it like that site that, like, in practice health often and do you have a question that you would ask to that ai? Yes.

Host 2: Not very often.

Host 3: I guess I was thinking about this as like, my own little, like, just novel idea chat Gp three. It's like, what if you ingested all Slacks things and then you can ask questions across Slack, basically. Like your slack your company. Because, like, slide. Exactly.

Host 2: You see the gist?

Host 3: There is No.

Host 2: Let me show you. Can you see my screen github gist?

Host 3: Or what?

Host 2: No. No. No. It's... Can you see this. Sure. Yeah.

Host 3: He it is basically this.

Host 2: It is.

Host 2: Yeah.

Host 2: So right now get some reason.

Host 2: Interesting. Dates in december, it's gold man. It's something awesome.

Host 2: Click pad morning steve, but the possible scam, Yes.

Host 3: Okay that's, but, like, you could ask it, like, Like, that that was like, I had like an idea for that. Like, it would be like But then everybody Has to, like, ingest... You have to ingest, like, literally everything from your Slack and then be able to answer, like, intelligent questions based on.

Host 2: Yep.

Host 3: But it wouldn't be... It'd would be pretty good. I think I would be a pretty good business. If you do that in Slack, if you do that meetings, like, i'll, you know, like you said, all your communications email, Slack Zoom. And then you just ask it list questions about. If it chat Gp three based on all that data. It has all that context.

Host 2: Yeah. Again, i intellectually, I get excited about it practice I won't repeat because like, there is that company that's called gl No.

Host 2: Eight eight That's basically what i'm talking about.

Host 2: Yeah. It's exactly that. And I don't know how successful from deal. I I have a friend who works there I could ask.

Host 3: Yeah. Those. It's a novel idea but like, yeah, It's it's also one of those things that's like technically a lot of work to get to a decent spot. And then, you know, you've done all this giant amounts of technical work and then, like, you know, does anybody even really wanna Yeah.

Host 2: Exactly. It's... I mean, it is work, but doable Work.

Host 3: Well, I've just said, like, this is literally just like, god. It's like integration health basically.

Host 2: Like.

Host 3: Yeah. You're, like, try to stitch together all these like slack the way that they air Api works and this Api then all these things you're putting all into one like basically model and search you know, elastic surgeon index and trying to search across that.

Host 2: Yeah. Doesn't look like a very opening product. I feel like, that's the thing, like, haven't found yet a very community product in that category. Oh, no. Still not here. Yeah. So I mean, if you look at the tracker like these two categories here. So Station intelligence is like for sales and then meeting manager is like don't meeting managers. I don't know what me he's doing here, but whatever, all of those are actually, like meeting managers mh.

Host 2: This is employee account, which is about as good as like, success you can think. Look at the difference way. Gong is huge and growing Basically, this see the omni category that's growing right now. Look at the average down there. Right Four hundred three seventeen three forty five. Well, like, look at the here it's shrinking. Right. Right Right. Right? Like this is the category is not successful right now. Yeah. Interesting. So I mean, maybe the disease is like Ai changes all of that, But Yeah.

Host 3: Don't think so. I mean, like, i know the Ai thing Right? Is gonna spawn a bunch of other like, competitors. I can do stuff. But, like, people were doing this type of stuff without the Ai, they just had their own models and stuff before. Right.

Host 2: But it kind of sucks. If you look at like fire, Sure.

Host 3: But like, you could say that it was being done like, with algorithms and Ai beforehand. You were just doing it, like, but the magic...

Host 2: The magic is in the details. Right? Like, if it's sucked something that'd be good and I couldn't find right that, but, like, Bio is the disease dispute thing where it's like meeting recap. Pc is a research. This one I think is good. No, maybe it's not fire applies. Which one? Other, maybe it's other.

Host 3: So No.

Host 2: It's not bell. It's other. Nobody do. So like they show you like, these questions here. And that kind of sucks like I don't care about this. I do kill by the summary. I do care the the action items. I don't care the discussions.

Host 3: Yeah. I like to leave to this timestamp.

Host 2: Yeah. The product is on that good I feel.

Host 3: Think we would probably like that. Also, we should probably jump off this call because Keith is gonna get all of like.

Host 2: Just.

Host 2: Yeah. If if if he's listening the inquiries when he thinks to about this gem, Yeah. Look at this. This is not ugly. Is like it's there's no... I can't even watched the recording it just sucks Yeah. Alright. Cool. Yeah. Let's jump out. Alright. Let's
