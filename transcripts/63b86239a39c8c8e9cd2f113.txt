Host 2: Alright. Let's see. This week I've been working on workflows. There's some expiration there. We sort of simplified the idea to be more like just Slack integrations where you know, you can you can have all your meetings posted to Slack and then we're work down on some ideas around how you could have, like, some sort of conditional like, statement set up so that if a meeting meets certain criteria, it would post in a certain channel. So still working on that. I think we're moving the the sync until Monday.

Host 1: But that's Yeah.

Host 2: It's gonna be kinda cool. So, like, I'll meetings that have, like, the longest monologue, for example, like... Or maybe a a long model log stands out. Would be added, like, filtered it out and then added like posted in Slack or, you know, you could you can configure anything. Like, if if it mentions a competitor or don't I guess this sky's is the limit. You could ask a question. And, you know, if the query response is a certain thing, I don't I don't know how we'd set that up. But yes. It'll be pretty cool. So so... Yeah. Look for that on Monday. And let's go with her.
