Tom Cruise: Even the no, Simon simone had something like, or it was like his you've been around people shooting guns on New year's.

Client 7: I sent that the nineties for a while, but I was quite nineties so I can very make memories but yeah, when were you born like, ninety four?

Client 7: Ninety five.

Client 2: Five. Like big change topic.

Client 2: All that matters is how, you know, the age you feel?

Tom Cruise: Oh, I'm reading a book. It's fascinating. It's called Lifespan. By debits sinclair. And so basically, they've now found ways to reverse aging. It's published in nature. It's proved proven so they can, like, make you younger, like, literally. And the book is all about that. And he basically goes, like, oh, no. The people who are gonna turn the hundred and fifty hundred and have already been born.

Client 2: And my god.

Tom Cruise: Fifty is the new forty and he's gonna be... He says, like, any thirty years fifties a new thirty.

Client 2: It's like god.

Client 2: There we go. Let's hang tight.

Client 3: I hope get through this.

Client 2: Alright. Well, happy to year you your the beginnings. We didn't have a fun fact, but I thought I'll start with a little quote, which I really realized it's fine As the mine said, right it your heart that everyday is the best day in the year. You know, who now want the new year brings, and I'm sure it's gonna be just another roller coaster on the startup front and personally, started to see what it brings for everyone. Yes. Every day it's a gift. Why are we why are we diving in? What's what... Why we excited about what we're doing? What least works for me, and I know And on everything i wanna be is already invested in the mission is we're here to enhance you in potential through connection. I jumped into our channel with end user testimonials and I saw that people were still taking our orbit chats. Up until the last day the last... The last day of the year, and really getting incredible to testimonials and value like it was great because it opened my mind to other ways to expand my knowledge and income based are really really tangible outcomes from these connections that it has human potential I'm very, very excited about another year ahead and maximizing our mission and increasing our footprint of communities that we connect. Values. Of pathfinder. We're going to find ways to continue growing, continue and how out impact and we are going to win. This is the year when a lot of things are gonna come together. And the champion mindset that's within every single one of us. Fully unleashed. I'm not sure if you saw my a little tweet that I shared on a threads for happy New year from Luke. Was from a guy jim Kw, twenty twenty. Was the carrier Yes. Cater Caterpillar here twenty twenty two, the twenty twenty three is the butterfly year. So champions we're gonna rally despite despite headwind still in the economy and whatever else they brings, and we care. That's that's what makes the company special. We're human first and everything we do, where considerate towards one another towards our my or investors and It's our pretty secret sauce. More. This is this is always a very rapid transition. Feel like we need something in between the big mission at into the numbers. But... Yeah. Then numbers are looking good ringing in seventy clients in total now get towards six sixty k Arr. So looking great. The first of of the of the quarter and the everything goes back to zero. So you're seeing that error added is only five k, but actually given that is the second working day of the year. So pretty great, Me. This is one of yours.

Tom Cruise: I believe us we don't have, like, one at signed like, on the... Not on on the last day of the year like the twenty ninth the you close one, and we had to like rush through a payment, like an invoice?

Host 1: Yeah. It was like in the on the twenty fifth or something like that he wanted to rush it in for his budget.

Host 1: Don't know actually happened, but I think so.

Tom Cruise: I think it went out, Galadriel, I think send out the invoice now on like, the twenty ninth or something I saw something come by?

Client 8: It was Ver, It was tri us.

Host 1: I think the the invoice went up, but I don't know if they actually paid it within twelve thirty.

Host 1: Oh, right.

Client 8: And I don't think they did.

Client 2: Well, they have it. So... yeah, numbers looking good good start pipeline. Yeah. Again, for beginning of the quarter, actually looking decent and Lee has been working on an amazing sales strategy, what's tweak in the New Year once we flesh it out a little bit more. Share it with the wider team, But, yeah, a little bit about... Thank for everyone that was holding the fourth last week, I really really appreciate it everyone's effort was responding to very few whatever cloud requests we had and focused engineering work and lee also on the sales front. Signing deals, a couple of other ones went through as well. So the last couple luis we did add twenty k arr some of which did feel like a last minute gift for sure. But we'll we'll take it. It was amazing. And then if you outstanding proposals that will be chasing in January, highly already has a couple of prospect meetings, and my folks is getting more prospect meetings in the calendar. But I wanna highlight oh, Bear we me for one second. I guess slide that I was working on remained. Oh, hit moved. My next.

Client 2: Yeah. Both double w. Okay. To I wanted to highlight two amazing opportunities that one that are confirmed and Lo got confirmed in the last couple of working days and one got confirmed yesterday, so a great start of the year. The first one is a new Vc client, well, it's more of a Highland, because they haven't opt out. It's with a Vc fund called stage two capital or B software fund And the unique thing is that their investors so their Lps the invest in their fund are sea level executives, at the world's top saas companies. So the woman on the top lip corner. She's the ceo Hubspot. You have, like, Zero Zoom, Vps and c level exec and atlas last year game side. So that's gonna be tough these are the people and the audience that they'll be connecting through Orbit and it's rooted in credible exposure for us in front of the top top leading brands. Some of which are very community focused and huge audience is potentially to engage and get their interest. So we're gonna be treating that even though we signed them up as an essential client we be rolling out the red carpet and double and triple everything to really make sure that they have a great experience because he's...

Tom Cruise: When they wanna... When their week start?

Client 2: I know they they have an opt todd by the end of January. So Merry, I haven't seen an onboarding call getting booked.

Client 9: Guess Something's been booked. We we sent the follow... Email so I'll pull up them again today to see, but but we we followed up you get that to get that bug done.

Tom Cruise: Maybe I send the intro to Merry yesterday.

Client 2: We'll do it together. They're very, very intentional so the community manager and the operating partner does a lot of hands on introduction. So they'll be the type of flight that knows what they want versus someone that necessarily we need to guide. So very, very excited. And They're very engaged. And really believe the product. And I think if it goes well, it's maybe be an upsell as well. They're interested in group matching. And then the other one, which is potentially even more exciting is a confirmed partnership with C This is again the conference that Adi and Galadriel went to in September, we were junior sponsor at the time. Getting getting the opportunity to to have physical presence of their annual conference. They sent us a package for twenty twenty three And we decided to continue the sponsorship with them and they're offering a bunch of put our logo here and there, which I'm always a little bit skeptical just Yeah. Just putting out a logo out there, especially when there's two other orbits in the space. And manage to negotiate them actually using the product. So we're basically paying them ten k for the sponsorship package again, to go to the annual conference, mentions and various awards that they're doing and content pieces. But most importantly, they have a community of twenty thousand community professionals that we that we'll be using orbit for a minimum or will be invited to use Orbit. A minimum of six times next year. So they'll start off with every couple of months. That's that's the commitment in the in the contract, but we'll try to get them to do it even more frequent they see how easy it is to use the product. So these are two really really promising confirmed opportunities that very excited about.

Tom Cruise: Was just thinking we had B platform last year or i the year before, technically, That was a thousand people gave us thirty clients Yeah.

Client 2: A third of our clients are still from that partnership with sounds like, okay.

Tom Cruise: Twenty thousand I'm I'm aiming for at at least a hundred clients. The end of this year from this.

Client 2: I i know. I'll be i'll happy. I'll be happy when with like. Tobias premium. Like...

Tom Cruise: That's true. Like okay yes. I'd rather have ten premium than like, a hundred ...I have have a good feeling about it.

Client 2: They they... They're not doing it's a very, very engaged community and they're not doing anything related to this, and they did say that the community has skin asking for better ways to meet each other property. So Yeah.

Client 2: We we actually we were hoping to onboarding even before christmas, and my phone is very flexible. Booked and revoked and then just it was very important to include that agreement. Them agreeing to use the product and they does so we'll be doing the onboarding call in the next couple of weeks Hopefully brilliant and kicking up. Asap. So, yeah. That's a little bit from on the sales and Bd front. Definitely, I would say a better than expected start to the year given that it's it's day two and these opportunities are very very, very promising. Merry over to you.

Client 9: Okay. So because we have a lot of clients in onboarding, I have to break this down and two slides. So the first slide we will look the gap right now, These are gonna be all our folks that have had onboarding calls already. So everyone here has already had an onboarding call as and process of it, and you can see an update here in the status note of either when they're kicking off or when our next our next touch point is in the onboarding process. So we have some some matching router reviews coming up in january... January six, January fifth for start experts in angel club, so they're well on their way. The only one I do wanna flag on this list here is gonna be e wealth slash jun So luke and I sent their matches to them yesterday. They only have thirty five opt ins on this one their first engagement had about a hundred offense And so this one was a little bit lower. Their op date is one fourteen twenty three so January fourteenth. So just kinda wanna flag back because I think with the opt dropping. It's probably a little bit less than ideal, also considering that they felt a hundred opt in on the first engagement was a little lower than or or decent amount lower than what they were hoping to get. It was... It was about one percent of the audience they divided. So we were quite far off from the ten percent a few things that we think could have And in fact that is that they are... They started out using group matching. So we know that one on one is usually gonna be our strongest product to kick off with, We offered trip them to run a one on one engagement so they could test out strongest product. And they said they only have a need for group matching. So just wanna flag that right now for Junk.

Tom Cruise: Other than that... I two two questions on this. Did we get matches back from them did I respond to.

Client 9: So they they have not, but I'm chasing them after this call to get done because we need to get emails out today.

Tom Cruise: Okay. Okay. So the one thing that I think contributed to the low number of options they ran it over Christmas and New year's. Like they shared like, the form closed like the week of was it like, twenty ninth originally? And then I moved it to, like, January second, so I'm not surprised to do it.

Client 3: Yeah.

Tom Cruise: It didn't opt in. It's like it's the time of the year where nobody's checking their their inbox.

Client 9: Yeah. This this registration window is open for almost like, three weeks. As well. It it opened like, the first or second week of December as well. So it was open for a very long period of Time we actually extended it twice. Okay. Like but yes. The time of year, did, I think we do believe it did play impact.

Tom Cruise: On that.

Client 9: And then if there's not any questions on any folks here, we can move on to the next slide.

Tom Cruise: What, was Jebediah out? Oh, I was gonna say. He has to run off foreign urgent doctor's appointment.

Client 9: So the only folks that aren't on here yet is actually C because we do not have the side contract from them. Once we have that they will be added onto this list and But you can see stage two capital is on there as Billy mentioned with their Correct. Off date So this is everyone who has not had an onboarding session yet. These are either new deals and the First one up pop here is Christina Lo coaching. So on December twenty ninth, they reached out and asked if they can push the start date of their time track back to March, lead and i game plan, and we thought that would be okay. As long as they paid their original invoice by the original due date of January twenty eighth, which they agreed to. They haven't paid it yet. There's no opt out fee, so we didn't see a risk and pushing it back two months as long as they paid upfront before we agreed to move anything back, So that's where we are with Christina lo. Back vc. We have an onboarding install scheduled for January eleventh. Diversity b. I reached out to them once we have the introduction email, We got out of office, Like As know they're gonna return January night. So there's no op update on that contract either, but I probably wouldn't expect to hear anything back until then just given the out of office. Stage two capitals. I'm gonna chase them again today considering their opt out window closes at the end of this month, but we did just follow up with them yesterday. And then Todd's ventures, mainly have our first onboarding call scheduled with them on Jan sex. So Pretty much everyone here is in motion, I feel pretty confident other than wells who I mentioned earlier.

Client 2: Great. Thanks for the overview. And so Merry, can you please add me to the back vc onboarding. Yes.

Client 2: They are the community managers room based we had them before as a client.

Tom Cruise: Like, somehow they it sounds good.

Client 2: They they came back after two years.

Tom Cruise: They're one we i'll dropped to the.

Tom Cruise: Like, we've I've seen this name before but...

Client 2: Yeah. I know they were really about to sign and then disappeared. And then literally, I got an email out of the blue and up october one November, finally ready for harvest.

Tom Cruise: So we go.

Client 2: Our current five k, but... Yeah, better day than ever. And a great based.

Tom Cruise: Alright. Cool. So I'll just quickly reiterate that we discussed before I think before I went on holidays, so still, like December fifteen to, like, roughly early early February. We have three priorities platforms stable and fast. Increase some of the product flexibility adaptability so to make it more like to have an extend to more use cases and we're starting to build out the integrations and Api we go to the next slide, we've made some decent progress over the last two weeks. First of all, tech that feedback forms are gonna be handled by Jebediah this week next. So I've given him everything he needs is finishing up some like, minor tasks now, and then he's gonna jump on that. So those are gonna move in the all tech like legacy code. Jacob who unfortunately, could be here has a first proof concept of curious George which basically is a monkey that is now able to go to our app and log in and do, like, a first few steps and he's now defining like, okay, what the first, like, paths that George is gonna follow to, like, start clicking on stuff. So that's that's going really well. It was easier to set up than expected. And we hope to have, like, something that we can actually use on every code change or every merge to domain. In about a week or two. Ian has been doing some great work on faster queries because we saw before and we knew this that for very large opt pools. So think like five thousand plus or matching pools, the platform will start to slow down considerably. And that's Basically, the front end will slow down because it like, takes too long to, like, get all the data. Ian has made some massive improvements there. They're in Ua now. We're facing issues with like like variables that have changed slightly they're... Like, once we've overcome them, we can start to move into prod. But this should really speed up the platform for like, larger pools like Bev, for example C where we need this. So we're right in time for that. Deeper analytics, we've had added additional metrics the workspace dashboard, fifty percent of them are there. Yeah other fifty percent will come in the next two weeks. One of the last ones we'll do is, like, email open the click rates. Writing the tickets for that now. And we they're available, we'll start to display them in in the dashboard as well. Ci, I know I seem one have me some great progress on, like, releasing getting stuff automatically released the production faster and Cmos making some Api updates over the weeks to support the public Api that Dean is working on. So all in all this is taking along quite nicely. And then on the next slide, This is more like that was stability. So Api integrations is blocked now behind that one issue that Ian is looking into. Once that is figured out, we can start to create the first endpoints write at documentation and I know Vc platform is one of the first people who willing to, like, test this the Api that at least. I will probably start with Hubspot as the only integration to test it with, like, two three clients once we're comfortable with how it works, will add Salesforce which should be relatively simple. Evergreen data, is going really well. I'm finishing up the app today. Format means that we can load in data that is stored against members we can skip the questions where it's there. We can also ask them to recon it. So it's pre filled, but they just have to confirm it but they can't change it. This will make it a lot more flexible to have customers provide their own data and have people sign up without having provide without having to provide the same data again. Later in the month, we'll do engagements without scheduling account support. And then one thing that we've rep slightly is we're gonna make an effort into creating like a... Well, it will be a micro service that handles it, but something that creates sandbox workspaces. And the idea would be someone gives us their email where that's on website or like some other way and we create an entire workspace for them that is like shielded off from everything else and has fake data they can play around. They can click around. But nothing will happen. No matching what happened it's literally for them to get a feel for like how the platform looks. Which should really help Merry with... like, for example, smoother onboarding of essential clients where we can say, set up the sandbox, have a play around and we'll schedule a call afterwards. To really walk through, like, setting up your first engagement. And then for Anna, which will come after she's done with the the email alert for significant data changes, roll changes or company changes. A submit asymmetric matching, which would be like expert to or mentor men is probably the easiest one to to think about? Or expert the customer. So those are the focus for, like, Let's say the next six, six to eight weeks, roughly.

Client 2: Awesome. Well, it's exciting Seems like the quiet time around the holidays was used productively.

Tom Cruise: Jake Jacob both curious George. Sounds like and it was... And it was like, doing stuff after two days. I was like, okay, that's pretty fast. Expected, like, the setup time to be a lot longer, but it was easier than expected.

Client 2: Awesome. You said he's going to demo cures George howard how we demo?

Tom Cruise: Well, he can show what you can already see a demo and I think it's products platform channel, like, a no team platform, think there's a video I will it Yeah. There's a video there. That people from like, just before New year's. Where you can see it curious george logging into the to the platform. But I'll share it in a different channel later on product updates or something.

Client 2: Awesome. Cool. It's pretty really exciting and it seems pretty imminent. So Alright. Great. I'm clicking. Is that the last leg?

Client 8: I added a few here. Okay. Go back to.

Tom Cruise: Yeah.

Client 8: Actually, there's one more before this too.

Client 8: Okay. Yeah. So I just wanted to do a recap of everybody of q three. With customer success and renewal. We've renewed close to sixty thousand in revenue, but we turned fifty four thousand, so we had close to fifty percent churn again, for the second quarter in a row, but q one is looking a lot better. Also q three we had we were supposed to have close to a hundred and fifty at for renewal, but some of that Some of those customers ask for extensions and now we're renewing q one, which is making q one Q is was already our biggest renewal for quarter for renewal but it's even bigger now. We about two hundred and seventy thousand dollars up for a renewal in One. So q three was smaller than anticipated, but it's flowing over one. Q three sorry. This is q four next slide, billy? No. Sorry. This is one. Sorry. This is q one. I Clearly But that this is more?

Client 8: This is q four. Yeah.

Client 2: The next one like, wow, we're really having a deep review here.

Client 8: And then the next slide is q one, And So we got a real head start on renewal, thanks in large part to Penelope before she went on that leave, but we've already renewed about a quarter... Sorry, A third of the revenue that's up for renewal in q one. And about half of the clients that are up for renewal in One have already given us notice. Of or their decision not to continue. So we've got in a real head start on the quarter. Which is really exciting. Because like I said, we had we did have two hundred and seventy k up for renewal. And we now have about a hundred and seventy of that. Remaining. Really strong for January in February and as you can see, like, churn numbers for this quarter already a lot lower than the previous two have been, which is really exciting. We've renewed seventy one thousand dollars already, and we're not even in the first week of January. With a little bit of churn that we're anticipating, one from circular company ventures and then floor adventures. Which are we're all experiencing low options ins and just didn't get the full utilization of the pop form. So we're huge surprises. But that is what we're focused on for q one.

Tom Cruise: And then circular is that the like, the Spanish Hr?

Client 8: Yeah.

Client 2: Same Again.

Client 2: Thank you see guys for the big spring. Galadriel there was another one. Right?

Client 8: Yeah. Or. Yeah. And then this is line item by line item. The rest of the renewal that we have for q one. So we have sixteen left to renew. Again, that's only that's half of the clients, that were up for renewal in q one. So we really did get a a strong head start on this. And this is an order from when they're renewing to it's an order of when they're renewing. So forum is the next to. And going down through March. So we have only a few left for January and February. The majority are sitting in March. So we are getting... Everybody's been notified of their renewal and their renewal options to this point, but really gonna step on the gas reaching out to march renewal reminding them of their renewal next week.

Tom Cruise: What's forum has a date of like October is Yeah.

Client 8: That's one of the clients are saying decided. You they've been paying us monthly since they're.

Tom Cruise: Right. Know was calling a decision.

Client 2: Right. But apparently they've struggled as well with their own fundraising efforts in this climate. So it's trickling down to budget cards and they're an investor of ours, so I definitely want to work with us. But hoping that we we we they were at six k, so we offered them five k and waiting to hear a positive response in the next few days. Feeling optimistic, but Yeah. Definitely drag their feet there.

Tom Cruise: You know how big the fund is they try to raise?

Tom Cruise: Because they had such a blow out winner with was his name first base. No. Yeah They also they they hired a massive team very quickly.

Tom Cruise: Okay.

Client 2: I'm interviewing the community manager at Capital tonight for a Uk study. And when I saw her san Francisco over really several very good pis hours. Should it said it definitely renewing. So hopefully, no surprises there.

Client 2: Isn't it? Encore capital Tit from onboard Capital.

Client 8: Great. Yeah. A lot of these we feel very positively about. So I I we're really into spending much lower return this quarter.

Client 2: How do we feel about Tequila? Fifteen k, there must be struggling in this climate as well.

Client 9: From all accounts every time I work katherine, she loves working with team she loves the product. The community getting a lot of value out of it and they're running their their standard matching around. So I I I to have no no concerns with them either.

Client 2: Good. Yeah. All the fifteen k ones. I'm, like, Oh good water capital.

Client 9: Soogrim we're reaching out to them today to do a sort of warm up conversation to then lead into renewal. So I have that on my to do list too get back conversation going with us today.

Tom Cruise: You if you want me on any of those calls, by means I'm happy to join. Because I know that they always have, like all sorts of funky ideas about changes and like, we... Literally, like they were the first ones with to use group matching, part of the features were like dictated by their requirements. So yeah. If you want me there, let me know.

Client 9: Okay. Definitely. I'll cc you on the communications as well, so you can just stay brass with anything and then if we need that add on, what what we'll do.

Tom Cruise: Yeah. It's very good luck handling barrett. He's not really easiest person to to work with.

Client 2: Yeah. He's haven't an experience Merry with him already. Alright. Cool. Thank yes that was really an amazing sprint in December getting third of the renewal confirmed already, and a lot of invoices were paid at the of the year, so that was a really great start to the biggest...

Tom Cruise: I know. I just like panels on fire. Where like, all the payments come through.

Tom Cruise: I know. Cool. Another one. I was like I didn't even know that they were. That's good. Yeah.

Client 8: Yeah. One of the benefits of q one renewal is everybody we have extra budget at the end of q four.

Tom Cruise: And they have to like, finish finish the budget. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna Makes sense. Yeah.

Tom Cruise: Alright.

Client 2: Yeah. We did say this it's gonna be short in sweet. And it sounds like everyone is head on into the new priorities. So Thanks everyone. Good luck and we'll speak soon.

Tom Cruise: Em ian and just like in a in a up or down. Have you tracked down where the issue is? You knew where to like, start looking, Cool. Amazing. That's good. Alright. Since safe hands, I know.

Client 2: Awesome.

Tom Cruise: Bye Let's kick out.

Tom Cruise: Please meeting recorder.

Client 2: Oh, yes.
