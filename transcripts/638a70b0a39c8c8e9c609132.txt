Client 2: And find buyers for their commodities. So all of our work... is basically sales and recruiting and we're looking for an international dial that it's also a powered dial. And I've used or in the past Just great. That was a really great tool. I was very impressed. And it was almost too fast, like, you could burn through numbers so quickly that It was almost a long factor. And the biggest roadblock was are people prepared enough to make those calls at that speed. So we're very happy with it. Is expensive though.

Host 3: How much do you pay for?

Client 2: It was the company that I was at previously? And It was, like, four fifty a month, I think. Right. It's just if you can perform on all of the calls that you debt, but I think Yeah. It was interesting. It was almost like too fast. We're, like, It almost like, exposed whether you're prepared or not because you had so many trials. So I'll say that was very experience and it did what. This programmed to do.

Host 3: For fifteen months that is expensive. How how did you justify that that kind of price?

Client 2: Well our job was mainly outbound phone maybe fifty percent of the time was just waiting on dialed prune and leaving voicemail mails and most salespeople people don't wanna do that. Yep. It is fine consuming so that was a justification. And if we're were able to close one or two more deals per month, it was... They made sense.

Host 3: Yeah. Yeah. And and and will you Was i able to close deals?

Host 3: You have a modules per. Thanks to.

Client 2: I would say, yes. I was doing more business development, like the deployment setting in that role. But we eventually Yes. Maybe i'll say doubled our meetings. Versus the dialogue we we're using before, which is ring that io ring.

Host 3: Why was or i'm so much more successful than ring the audio.

Client 2: With the parallel dialing and the automatic voice functionality.

Host 3: And dial the day didn't have any of those.

Client 2: That's correct.

Host 3: I.

Client 2: Sequential dial yeah.

Host 3: I see. Okay. Do you know of any of those pilot values?

Client 2: K is one. K i x i e, How does it call...

Host 3: Have you used it before?

Client 2: I did a little bit of a trial on it. It was maybe a little bit a little bit cleaner than interface than Ring io. But I don't have too much experience with it.

Host 3: Those the What what's the difference we between Kick?

Client 2: I'd say K introduced the parallel data after afterwards, so it's a new product. And the nineteenth to these patents. Of voicemail and then leave your voice mail as a recorded message instantly. That wasn't feature that norm or that kicks you had.

Host 3: Page. Great. Do you remember how you found that bit or in the pills place Well, actually worked with one of the early team members there.

Client 2: How I got exposure to her. Interesting.

Host 3: Did you like tested that it?

Client 2: The speed That was very powerful.

Host 3: No. Mentioned... It could be too much sometimes.

Client 2: Yeah it was almost too fast because you can have the four parallel dial at once. I think It it was almost like you had the feeling that you were maybe missing out on some connects because it was going so fast. But maybe that was just a feeling honestly. Like, it it did exactly what it was set to do You mentioned it's it's just valuable like the speed if you're curtail and some sometimes people basically don't have the time to prepare.

Host 3: What what does that mean to prevail who who these goals?

Client 2: So a big part of being prepared as a sales team for calls is kind being in a salesforce environment.

Client 2: At least from the experience. I I guess, like, blasting through calls by herself, like, in your room is is one thing we're being able to kinda see what people are saying hear them, can be around that That was what was missing from have to look at our website.

Host 3: Website. Yes.

Client 2: Yes.

Host 3: That's exactly what we sell. Is is like, a virtual sales. That's that's Go ahead.

Client 2: Yeah. And just to give some more background, Like, I started my career as a Sdr at point of sale company end basically, I'm familiar with the No. Cultural benefits you can do this last team of having that exposure and being able to essentially in the boiler room with them? So I'm interested in learning more about, like, how you guys started with that party company and then why you're looking to add a dial letter or, like, how those are related.

Host 3: Yeah. Yeah. We we took a look the like roundabout route for that. So we we actually started it out with a built office which was really meant for, like anyone, the office. Because we're both looking good and all of that stuff. And and then we we actually found that, like, that works particularly well, we sales teams for exactly what you mentioned, like, the sort of like boiler room, kind of like the burners of the sales flow and all of that stuff. So we we went down on and then we realized like... what sales teams do on these voter rooms and sales scrolls they And so that's like one of the biggest with requests and people have like, hey, I want shoot integrations my data. So like one to tigers. It's like a full experience because those all two different print products. And so they're actually are actually building own data like it just trade burial together. Right? And so that's That's that's how we came about about this And so at the place without bull, do you do you currently use it the day here as well?

Client 2: No. We have a couple of different solutions we have a dial with Apollo dot io It's a leads sequencing and contact the gathering tool it has an integrated dial. So some of our international reps use that. Then we have some skype users as well So What we really want is a way for our team members in Venezuela and Columbia and Philippines in Kenya to be in one sales room one salesforce and then have parallel dial that can dial international need to, like, Europe Africa, United States Canada. And then just have that kind of blast through with no problems and integrate into hubspot.

Host 3: I mean, not like this is what we do. Okay. So let me can I book you up after until this meeting to our head of sales like, set up the demo with you and and get you started with the trial.

Client 2: Absolutely. Just to be transparent, you know, we don't have much of a budget to add. But I'm sensing the I could really help you guys in forming the product because I'm very experienced in that kind sales more environment especially at a software as service company, And then now I'm trying to kind of bring that same environment to online. And that's a really big frontier because you're gonna see a lot more sales teams like ours where it's completely distributed and we still want people to make the dials because you know, if you're managing salespeople, they're another country, it's kinda like What are you doing all day? But we don't really have that. Uncertainty at our end. So it'd be good to say like, hey, we're all in the sales room and we're gonna do this for two hours.

Host 3: I... I mean, that's six again, that is exactly what we do. Yeah. Is he a sense of, we can we can figure something out and and we will also be looking for like design partners as as we're building this dial. So Later on, i actually love to see my screen and and show you that the kind of design is that been working on and I'd love to get thoughts about it. What what did you dislike if anything a about wrong.

Client 2: Nothing the price is expensive, but I have no complaints.

Host 3: Any any specific feature you wish to implemented it?

Client 2: The sales was not a feature that was made. Well, while I was using it interesting.

Host 3: What else do you use right now for your sales? You you mentioned the photo what crm do you use any other two whatever?

Client 2: Hubspot is our Crm gmail is our email client. Skype for the phone.

Host 3: Anything else we could do in your? Tool that we could feel or any way your diver or anything like that could help you close deals.

Client 2: Well, maybe That's basically, it's. Like we just wanna be in a electronic environment with their salespeople, everyone's dialing and you can kinda see what's going on. Like, other than that, Like, everything else that just tells in this.

Host 3: Why don't you subscribe to Laura of current company.

Client 2: It's too expensive for us.

Host 3: Right. Yeah. Any other questions are Enrique for mark?

Host 1: Nope.

Host 3: Alright. Let me share my screen with you and should the kind of designs we have in mind for the Driver. Can you see this?

Client 2: See Alright.

Host 3: So the... I think one of the biggest difference type about here is... Do do you have a macbook pc back Okay. So it would look exactly like that then. So basically, you would... Is that we wouldn't be web based. It's like, we would be at on your desktop okay. That you would have to download and drag and drop onto your applications folder. Do you think of that?

Client 2: I mean, what data you gonna be collecting about my computer? I guess that's my question.

Host 3: Is that is that a big concern for you that, like the app would collect data about the better computer.

Client 2: Not really. But if there is revenue being generated from that, like, we'd like a piece of that.

Host 3: Okay. So to your question and in real life, you would me to tell you like. That's pretty the generating data me computer. Minding bitcoin or anything like that. That. That's what you mean. Reason why we would use an app is just it let's us we think build a better experience.

Host 3: So then the wake would work like, it would you would like select phone number you would do... Actually Enrique, do you know if we have, like, a prototype type of this?

Host 1: Don't think we do that.

Host 3: No. We don't. Okay. Cool. Sorry. Alright. So you would log in, you would Set a your phone number You could set call forwarding could integrate with your sales engagement platform, do you do you use any of these? Well, you mentioned the. Does the sequences as well. Right?

Client 2: Yes. So I we don't use any of those right now.

Host 3: And then... And so Let me show you something. This is what the dial inn interface looks like. So you would select What do you what do you understand here from this Ui? What do you think is going on on that screen?

Client 2: Kinda hard to tell, but it looks like it's a bunch of leads to go.

Host 3: Anything that confuses you here?

Client 2: Yeah. I guess, I mean it just kinda looks like a list of names, but it's not super confusing, but it's not super clear like what's going on as well.

Host 3: Oh, How could it be made So you you So, yes. It is a bunch leaves. So like here. It's better of text from your sequence.

Host 3: Okay. Do you select sequence here and then it tells you like, how there's all the folks to call And What would you do here?

Client 2: What would be really kinda straightforward for from my perspective is Like, if you've seen hubspot tests Yep. The test sequence works like a full screen and it's like here's would be calling fast go. Here all the people that we're gonna call like, here's maybe playbook or script of what to say. Yeah. But this is it's clear, but I feel like that there'd be more information displayed. Because we wanna make it as easy as possible for our reps to to use.

Host 3: What kind of information would you like this plate here?

Client 2: All the crm information and also a top track I actually I remember that warren had a configuration where you can set the fields that are displayed. On each lead? So that you could have those talking points. From the crm right in front of me.

Host 3: I see. And where you you have the field. Got it. And so do do you have what do you made the talking boys the fields. Not the.

Client 2: Yeah. So if a company has five locations and you catch the decision maker on the phone. You can say, oh well. You know, I noticed that you guys had five little locations, and that'll make it see more believable from a customer perspective that you like took the time to research them, etcetera. I think that's one of the tough parts about forum is that it's so fast that you don't have time to, like, Don't you crm a and say, oh, Alright. These all here's the notes from the conversation. That's why they headed it. Like, embedded into the dial relevant fields that you would use. In a sales conversation.

Host 3: I see. Got it. Okay. So you would like more information here on your Crm and you would wanna be able to show the reps where is the duck the dark track.

Client 2: Yes. Maybe even like a top track is a separate module, but the module to display information from our Crm. That you feel is most relevant to your sales conversations. Mh.

Host 3: That makes sense. Well, thank you. Pull the feedback. So right now, the way the way it works on these design is like, you you would press stop sequence here What would you expect still to happen after you've done that?

Client 2: You hear a dial tone?

Client 2: They either pickup or they don't.

Host 3: So another idea we had which love to get your first of that is In this in this product, you would be able to recall the voice mail But in the voicemail mail that you record you would be able to place. Like, you will be able to, like, literally record in your voice mail like Hi Phil name. I saw completely name online, and I thought it'd be great to reach out. And and then we use Ai to replace first name and complete name by that guys like name and company.

Client 2: How would you say, like, would the... If his name was George, would you record George and then that would be filled in or would you s synthesized the name from some sort of, like machine learning thing.

Host 3: The. So you wouldn't... It would sound like your voice with this cms, basically, that wouldn't don't be... You wouldn't be able to tell the it's automatically generated. You would like you to be like, hey, Joel. This so acting line and you. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. Please do that. That'd be great. And then also faked video sales letters.

Host 3: That know That's gonna be huge.

Host 3: Yeah. Definitely. How big of... Well, actually, between these two, had to pick one of that. Like thought automatically like, deep fake voice mail versus deep fake like the video later. Which of the two would you think?

Client 2: video letter for sure.

Host 3: Oh, wow why?

Client 2: Well most people don't read voicemail mails? Or listen to them? And the video sales letter is gonna be more effective. His visual. And if it looks real, I mean, that's so much better than a voice mail it's like almost not even comparable.

Host 3: But How would you send that video?

Client 2: Well, you would have a script, say, like, Hey. My name is Mark. I saw that you had a flower form and Guatemala we help floors in the United States sourced directly from farmers like yourself, you be interested in learning more about us. And then you could put merge fields for all the personalization. So it looks like like you reported it with your own face and then Know what I mean So then we just said it they text still by email.

Client 2: By email.

Host 3: Got it.

Client 2: Say that the sequence calls for giving them a call, and if they didn't pick up the phone, then you send them a Ai generated deep big.

Host 3: Got. Alright. Well, that's that's useful So on on a scale of one then, like, how useful do you think that voice mail, like, deep fake voice would to be.

Client 2: An eight.

Host 3: Y heat.

Client 2: Because voicemail mails are still effective. But most people are not want to leave one hundred voicemail mails. And if that was automated, than the cost of voice mail would be almost zero and you can view like, unlimited voice mails essentially. What I liked about lauren was If it didn't pick up, it would leave your automated voice and then you wouldn't have to to do the whole like leaving a voicemail mail because people don't really wanna do that.

Host 3: Yep. Okay. That's his good. Let's see what else we have here. Well, it that it's just settings. Any thoughts about this design I would like to see it more about the full screen with all the relevant patient.

Client 2: But I mean, it looks like it's pretty straightforward now.

Host 3: Yep.

Client 2: Almost like a... Well, what would help is visibility into what other people are doing. Especially in, like, a Sdr type environment. Like, competition is a very big component of that. So to be able to see that your Fellow Sdr are dialing right now and they're making connections and you're not. I guess, that would kind of prevent a lot of that Not doing anything.

Host 3: You know, Yes. Actually, I think we have that somewhere don't know work. Well, you can see You can see So these like you'll fiddle his deals And you can see who's dialing correctly, it looks like that icon. And and you have your own like, diet here on the left. Is that is that what you had in mind?

Client 2: I was thinking more competitive like...

Client 2: Oh, this is the number one rep. They said ten meetings and then you're gonna look at your picture. If you have zero meetings then you know, it's gonna be more of a motivator. Because right now, it's like Everyone's doing the wrong thing. And it's like, super silo. And you don't really get that sense of like Oh, I gotta step it up yeah. Because I used to work in like, an Sdr for tech environment, and we would like, one to get the phone let might get it before the person. You don't really get any of that direct competition when it's all virtual.

Host 3: Right. You can see here there is actually, we we have started, like that there would be a little bold feature in this designs though. I don't know if we have the design is ready for that yet. Do you do you know if we do Enrique?

Host 1: I sure.

Host 3: Great. So beyond the privacy sales and the fact that you know, we could generate any money from your computer information we this of that, which we wouldn't. All things equal would you, do you fulfill this be My understanding is that the desktop will perform better and that's what I'd be more interest interested in.

Host 3: Right. Yep. Certainly.

Client 2: Just to go back on that previous discussion about the dashboards it'd be really cool to see like a live like, meeting tracker for, like, that day even. And, like, how many dials everyone has done what the outcomes were and how your personal production compares to all people on your team That way it's like, like, clear who's producing and who needs to increase their production.

Host 3: Love that. One hundred.

Client 2: Somebody sets a meeting like, that should alert to everybody else that other people are setting up meetings.

Host 3: Yeah.

Client 2: Like, at a previous company, once you set up a meeting, there'll be Tvs throughout office that showed your face in the custom song.

Client 2: Put in everyone's space that like, hey, like, I'm setting at meetings. And that forces everyone to about internally and say, like, Why am i not?

Host 3: Right. Yeah. Great. Awesome. Do you have any questions, Enrique?

Host 1: This is really useful feel.

Host 3: Yes. I have enjoyed the producers as as well, Mock. Would you be at if we perhaps conducted you again later once the designs are will placed out perhaps those have the, like, food screen like dorian, And oh, would you be able to you to like slack and ask you a few questions from time to time Like hey, And let just just right in which you prefer.

Client 2: I'd be open to either you know, I'm curious, like, where you guys are at can terms developing this product, like, when you expect it to be released and kinda what the challenges have been from your perspective because for my understanding, you were initially focused on just general office. Rooms and then now looking to more the sales enable tool. Am That right?

Host 3: That's exactly right.

Client 2: And I think a lot of that Like, what do salespeople people want to have in a platform form. I think I could really help him that and we would love to have a solution that is tailored to exactly what we want. And as I mentioned, that the whole idea of global distributed sales team is just gonna increase in the future.

Host 3: Yes. I agree. Can you remind me how your reps? Do you have menu right there?

Client 2: We have five now.

Host 3: Alright. Well, let me then add you to our stack and and we may if you we'd have another meeting, in a few more weeks. Question where wheel all now is... I mean, we'll just getting started like, this is really the first integration of these designs. And so I think we're probably gonna have It feels the solution of this data around the end of January. So... Yeah, we'd love to count a few moments to fill stuff at this.

Client 2: Yeah. Absolutely. I think maybe the only thing I could add is that defect voice feature could be also very useful for linkedin messages or even just any sort of like hey. I'm gonna one audio file because it can really help in, like, Linkedin prospecting because he used to signal like, I'm a human and I'm talking to you through a voice, but if you could skip that and just kinda send out automated deep defect voice messages, that could be huge. Because it's super scalable.

Host 3: What percent then leave like that email integration for the sequence so that it sends out based on your sequence.

Client 2: I think kind of preserving the sequences from outreach or hubspot what have you? So you really useful. So that it doesn't like mess up your cadences.

Host 3: So when you embed, i like, you would want it to integrate with as outreach have hubspot or not and and completed the steps since the sequence, like, synchronize with with these sequences. You.

Client 2: Yeah. Like, even if It's like, okay, they didn't pick up. While, we're going to send them a deep defect. Audio. Or something like that. Or fake video. But basically, we wanna preserve the existing sequence and just make sure that we don't have to like only use the tool for, like, this specific part of the sequence and then make sure that we go back to it basically having it integrated in preventing the need to switch through one tool to another. Interesting.

Host 3: Awesome. Alright. Well, thanks a knock. Well we'll be dutch I I actually, I didn't totally assume to a team teammate who, you know, again can walk you through the the the the sales flow and get up feedback about agents and forth. And I we'll definitely give you as we our pricing of the dialogue project.

Client 2: That sounds great.

Client 2: Would love to help you guys out.

Host 3: Because They not definitely needed, you know, i'll forward.

Host 1: Thanks, Mark.

Host 3: Thanks. They easy.

Client 2: Oh, yes. Just real quick. So that seventy five dollars be sent? Is it gonna be a gift card or something?

Host 3: It's an gift card if that's okay with you.

Client 2: Yeah. That works.

Host 3: Yep. Awesome. Yeah. So my assistant will be touched by by email.

Client 2: Sounds great. Well, thank you guys for the opportunity to kinda share some dollars. And I definitely think you're on the right track. So I look forward to hearing from you.

Host 3: Thank you. We all excited you as well. It easy.

Client 2:
