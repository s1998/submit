Host 1: We got a lot of quarters now.

Client 2: Yeah. My screen asked me to do it too, and I was like, I think everyone's going to join with the reporting on. So Yeah.

Host 1: Let's testing.

Host 3: We've got looks good everyone.

Client 4: Everyone's note takers will be up all meetings will probably be it'll be like, it'll look like twice the capacity now.

Host 1: Perfect.

Client 4: Cool. So Yeah. Hope. Hope everyone's been having a good start the week so far. Just to couple quick things to go over on my end. So I did kinda start off a campaign just to do a little bit of testing reaching out to the the flow industry. But some of you guys may have seen some emails come out from on your behalf. That'll... That'll be a fully fledged actually, fully fledged campaign. So I'm going to give you guys kind of a a some list folks to call into. Which would be probably a second party after those you know, warm email open tasks. Since the Valentine's day is coming up probably in in less than two months. You know, it might... It's probably a good a good industry to go after and see if we can get some easy wins and some kind of, you know, put some in incentive before that time period happens because they usually see kind of you know, record order numbers around the February time frame. And then I'll get a little bit more into detail on this after after we do an evaluation but I nowhere looking at some conversation intelligence tools, So I don't have any guys used anything in the past like Chorus or gong that'd be curious to hear anyone's feedback. Okay. Alright. Well, I'll I'll keep you guys updated on that front. And then, yeah, Just kind of since it is Monday, thought we could just to Kinda go go around the the circle here for both myself and Str sdr just kinda talk about some some goals for the other week. So Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sorry. It it it feels like a Monday.

Client 4: But, yeah. Still since we don't typically do these on Monday since that's when the since we have since we have another meeting, kinda there and I don't wanna double meetings up I do want tuesday to be kind of a day while we just talk about a weekly goal for us. And then each day we can kinda each go through day. So on my end, I have a couple new campaigns. I'm looking to get built out just to be ready and time for for kinda you one to kick off. So one is gonna be The first one I'm kinda working on and putting out will be going a little bit deeper and see the the fashion industry focus and some of our work there. And then I also have actually to two new str sdr that are hoping to get offers signed by by end of week. So those are kind of a couple a couple things in my agenda that I should have wrapped up for for Friday. I guess Kelly, what about you and any personal or personal goals for this week.

Client 5: I'm aiming for about three a day try to get five though or more as many as I can every day, but free day would be good, so I could end it out with whatever three times five is fifteen.

Client 4: A week. Yeah. I love that. Just fill up these guy's calendars. We don't wanna see yet. I don't really wanna see a lot of white space on the I don't need the eighties calendars. So that should that should be a it's just to to turn it all already.

Client 5: Also so I don't know if you guys need another enterprise year, but I have somebody in mind if you want. If you want them, Yeah.

Client 4: You have if you have a referral, I can send you the the application link for sure.

Host 3: Kelly?

Client 5: Are they what?

Host 3: They like you?

Client 5: I'm assuming so. He's he's definitely a Goof. So Yeah.

Host 3: I mean, we'll we'll take it. We love it.

Client 4: If he if if he balances the goof with the with the the work, then I think du will just be the the standard Yeah.

Host 3: Seriously.

Client 4: Okay. Yeah. But that that sounds good. Like, center them my way. Sent you, what about... What about you?

Client 2: Yeah. So the only thing I have is a lot of people maybe on my list, or if it's our Ic. I reached out to about two dozen people who are not even the e ecommerce space on my list yesterday. So little bit of a bummer on the cold calls yesterday. But definitely the goal is to get, you know, thirty plus meetings a month So I know it's set at twenty right now, but be nice if we can kind of have more strategic outreach to who are calling Yeah.

Client 4: When you say not in the ecommerce space, was there what was the title that you were seeing in there?

Client 2: I have to go back and look but a couple them were just digital. You know, he's just...

Client 4: Okay.

Client 2: Yes. Not even my department and a lot of those are on my list. So I'm trying to, like, filter through them. And then sometimes it's time time zones as well where It's like, two three Am. There and I understand that's more for like the afternoon for me. To maybe reach out to those prospects, but that there a filter that I can use when my prospects are already Once my task has already started, say have, you know, five hundred tasks to filter from there the time zones. So then I know who i'm reaching out to, which you know, which pretty much times that would be helpful. Then I can start early seven Am and reach out the East Coast. You know, been around ten eleven come back to the West Coast or do central time. And then say the afternoons for the out of the countries, but to right now, it's just scattered all over the place.

Client 4: Yes. You guys should definitely be using on your task list. These time zone filters to optimize your time even can see my screen now. Right?

Client 6: Yes, sir. Yeah.

Client 2: Yep. We can see it.

Client 4: Yes. So even if you just have, like a really specific time that you know is gonna be great. Actually, you can just do the local time. So you can actually pick what time it is for them currently? And just call them. So if you know, for example, you know that people on the East coast ten you know, pick up in the afternoon, then that's how you can set this up. I I think you have probably a few pre saved filters that I set up for you. But yeah, there's leads that get that are coming in, like in Europe or Australia. It probably doesn't make sense, you know, for your sent here call people in the europe since only you have about an hour window there. And Mike for Kelly it's, like, first morning task. But if wanted to call some folks Australia it'd be over it. You could do that too.

Client 2: I see that you're, like, the meeting set, but I'm saying if you go up to your home homepage right now. And then go to start task where you're... It's alright there. If you press start task, and your prospects come up, that's pretty much our task. And How how do we make adjustments from there. So right now, if you were to go press star task and your prospects come up. How can we filter the time zone from there? Because right now, it's still just scattered all over the place.

Client 4: Well I guess my question would be what would be the reason for doing the tasks from your home page rather than the task management tool, which is specifically built for that.

Client 2: Okay. So just go to it right here. This task place and filter it from here.

Client 4: Yeah. That that's what I would say is the best practice to because I mean, there's there's a couple ways to ago about it. One is to set it to be really prescriptive. But then it's kinda less I find the Sc sdr is typically in the preference of of some more flexibility there. So that they can kind of manage their some tests and grouping. Like, if you have, you know, your follow test some people prefer to do their follow tasks in the morning. And then do, like, there you know, they're typical you know, as an example they prefer to do their call tests. They're full of tasks in the morning and then do their typical just called outraged tasks. Like then after they get that knocked out. So this is how you could kind of do some some customization your preference on how you kinda wanna manage your day in your book. Is is through this. So if you can also do that same do that same exercise of just hitting execute all the sequences? Sorry, Execute all your tasks instead of doing them one at a time. So I can show an example. So if I just wanted to Like, let's say focus on my call tests from this campaign, that's says, like stopping my tracking tool. And filter them by the sequence if we use the Shopify tracking tool, that could still be someone in New Zealand that could still be so New York that could be someone in California.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 4: That's really wanna get then more specific So let's see just wanted to call people that were in you know, those Us and Canada time zones.

Host 1: Andrew off? Or let's let's see And enters on...

Client 4: Yeah, with he's out of office with the but the family. For during Christmas. I think there's some kind of Okay trip.

Client 4: So yeah. San you know, that's... So now it's just basically calling folks where their local time is in one of these brackets.

Client 2: And then do I have to call them from this page though. So what I just now you can just execute.

Client 2: I'll execute. And then this will kinda come up as a a a start... like my start task list might. Okay, From right here.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 4: Got it like this.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for clearing that up. Just so i can be more strategic on my heart instead are kinda just Yeah.

Client 4: There's host with it with the digital title. I'll try to I heard those aren't great prospects so I can... I I've been trying to avoid them, but sometimes they'll get in there. If they're on if there's another, like, overlapping title, like, it might be you know, digital growth because folks and marketing like they have a growth title that tends to a lot more of commerce.

Client 2: I can I I can go through and just look at some clean up there and reassign those.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: I know thing too is Calling the creative a director on it?

Host 1: Okay. Bye. When jobs said alright?

Client 2: Create a broker? Yeah. Not at all because for one that's not even their department, and for two, they're not decision makers for that department. The most someone can do is point in the right direction in even then if a company is a little bit bigger, it's harder or I understand that we reached out to various titles because sometimes at smaller companies, titles we'll do more than what they're asked and that could be their department. But I think right now.

Client 4: I I I would agree. You don't need to I I don't know we... Like a neither page of the or. Like, the... Even if they're the right person they just don't pick up the ground as much. We should be focusing on e commerce owners and operations and Cx. I think are kind of those and director of operations I've been man pretty good spot i said obviously, we have some deals that are done in the door and we can kinda just replicate you know, the titles from there, hey, they're decision makers and just so we're not wasting time speaking with someone who...

Client 2: Yeah, they may like our product, but they're not even one to pull the trigger to buy. So sometimes just getting that cleaned up.

Client 4: Yeah. And I'm I'm gonna go through and see if I can get, like, another Maybe some kind of workflow in through here just to move some of these move some of these out. Some of these may have been Sometimes there's, like, a discrepancy between titles in in Apollo and an zoom info. Which could be the reason why, but I think we I can still get some kind of automated work flow just clear out Like, you know, let's say that there's there's a... There's one of these created and they have title that we are trying to that we know is, like, We're trying to avoid like, marketing, creative director and digital. It might be able to just automatically reassign them or Mark them is finished or delete them. So I'll looking into adding some kind of trigger control on the back end. Yeah i tend degree there. Own. You also should can filter these out by just people with mobile numbers, which is another So, actually, those those ones shouldn't even appear if there's not a a mobile number there. Were there any other kind of ways you looking to, I guess customize it or filter out who you're reaching out to you a bit more?

Client 2: No, that's about it. I just wanted the the time the time zone correct because sometimes you're just you know, you're just calling each each number that comes up next. And I I... First I look at, you know, obviously, their title and then I go to their linkedin so I have a little bit of information about them when I call them. So seems like I've done some, you know, research and But sometimes I don't look at the time zone realizing that it's two forty two Am their time. So a good time to call them.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 4: I agree... Plus, you know, if it's even if it's like, three Pm. It doesn't make sense to call people east coast. So Kelly, are you are you currently using this task for you when you execute your tasks with some of those links that I gonna set you up on originally. See. Color so.

Host 1: Her fathom no tigers on.

Client 4: Okay. Maybe Oh okay.

Client 4: Alright. Well, yeah. That was Just kinda some of the... Yeah. I already kinda went through picks stuff on my end. Was there any other... I guess for you sent you any other questions or anything or you good to Good to go.

Client 2: Yeah. Roll. Thanks for clearing that up for me. I appreciate it.

Client 4: Cool. And so chen. I own Tongue clark on two.

Client 6: sir.

Client 4: Thanks sir thanks for jumping on. Was this just to were you on kind of tied into that question You yet earlier about, like, what people are hearing as far as product feedback.

Client 6: Yeah. So I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be focusing on like, analytics it's and well general, but also, especially really as it relates to sales. So I might even be your newest Str sdr for part of the the day and, like, next, like, month or something work. I wanna, like that into, like, what we you know, what's working what's not just like where the what the funnel looks like. So I'll definitely be joining calls and maybe even making a few cold call. Like I said, being an Sdr for a while on a maybe day for a while see it better what's What's what's working where we're where we're lacking where we're where we're selling all that stuff. Hopefully, and, I'm gonna be with you too, but I'm I'm glad I've got some time on this call to explained to for Kelly and San. Like, wanna... Like from a tools perspective and also just a funnel perspective to, like, be an asset like the the analytics that we have so that you I mean, maybe you you understand, like, exactly what leads to success already or maybe not, but wanna ultimately be an asset, like from an operational perspective, not just a reporting perspective. So Yes.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 4: May I love that.

Client 2: That would that would be awesome, Jericho. That that would be amazing. If you were to be Sd sdr kinda find out more about what our customers want the Aes and what the closing role is. And man we can learn a lot from you on that.

Client 4: That's... I I've actually... Maybe we can do this. I know. I know a few companies when they would do, like, kinda they do like, a a power hour or whatever, like a a a volume. Know, dialing day and then i Ceo, the better product, know, different folks that all do it as well. And I've I've actually heard... I've actually heard that it was was, like, pretty fun and the the product folks actually did get a good amount of meetings because they they really got the weeds.

Client 6: So... Yeah. I was more... I was more involved. I in, like, sales and demos like, a more, you know, sales engineer type stuff when it was just... When we didn't have a full sales team, so I wanna wanna get back into that as where as really just... The goal is, like, qualitative and quantitative stuff is I'm doing the you working on the F a stuff. But I envision, it will be similar to product where, like, we we have... We run pretty lean at first and then we You know, now we've got Brian who who kind of his leading the charge on on the product side that's kind what i vision. It'll be long term to will, you know, build out team there and So... Excited to to spend some more time of you guys.

Client 4: Nice. Nice. Yeah. And I would also say Sdr are usually good. Like, most real time source of market intelligence because they're hearing things that happen, you know, and and kind of real time if there are any changes. So you can definitely lean on them for that.

Client 6: Yeah. I've been seeing all these all these demos booked in the sales channel. So So Yeah.

Client 4: You if you wanna, like, jump on any ones there we can also probably get some insight there, like, if if you guys talk to someone in there, It's they seem like a pretty massive brand. It's... You might wanna go Jericho a heads up see wants a job on that one.

Client 6: Yeah. Kelly Go ahead, Kayla. Go.

Client 5: Oh no. Go.

Client 6: I was just gonna say you can you add me to the demos you have this week. I may not be able to make small or any of them, but can you add me to the ones that you you have this week?

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 4: Yeah. I might be able to add view to some right now. I think see there's just one that sent us set up with how to kick it.

Client 6: Oh, yeah. That one's tomorrow. Yeah. Topper I do that one here.

Client 4: Oh did.

Client 6: Yep.

Client 4: Okay. Perfect. Then I see build a soil. On on Friday.

Host 1: Trying to build a cell was earlier to that?

Client 4: So, I guess maybe it's a follow meeting on Friday. It looks it looks like it's getting Yeah. I don't really see a specific title there. So I'm I'm guessing here. Malik leak or just I set it up. And then I do see one on I do see one that James booked with the vitamin of friends, I will see on tuesday.

Client 6: Cool.

Client 4: I can add to that if Him, what can I do that? So Yeah.

Client 6: I appreciate that. I maybe I'm gonna be family trip down, but i maybe all that make it being Saint George. Guys know Saint George? Pretty pretty area in utah... Yeah. That'd be awesome. I think I'm might you'll make it though is our we're pretty... We got scheduled things out and I don't see anything on that day. So You know, probably doing make.

Client 4: Okay. Cool. Yeah. Kids kids vitamin company, so maybe. And get some free free vitamins steel open from them.

Client 4: I mean, it's it's not the fun stones, but thing.

Client 6: See, I had these bears growing up. So Those are... You what i would want.

Client 4: Nice. Okay. Cool. And then and Kelly, just just a second because you're muted it before. Are you using that same hubs execute that I showed cynthia earlier?

Client 5: Well, I'm using... I'm going to the the list the kelly's list, and then the other lists that people wanted me to jump on. I've tried to put them in that list or every day I just look I'm like, okay. Here's the stuff from Just i here's system stuff from malik. So I just go through that. And then I go through the Kelly's list. So Yeah. But one thing I was gonna say is how do we go about... Like, if somebody's, like, me from the call list Is there a button to do that? Or do I just take them...

Client 5: Mark?

Client 4: As a this stage as recycled, no interest. Automatically get moved.

Client 2: We're he just not interested It's in there. Just how you click it where it says no answer answered meeting, answered wrong contact. There should be one that says answered not interested. If you put not interested, I believe it just kicks them out of the sequence.

Client 5: Okay.

Client 4: Are you referring to when somebody emails you back and says they're interested or when someone says down the phone.

Client 5: When they say it on the call because I feel like I have done that, but the people keep showing up or maybe I'm just tripping. I don't know.

Client 4: If you... I'm pretty sure the workflow should be that if you mark it as answered, not interested. Then that should change there's their status to recycle no interest. And that should auto remove them from the campaign. If you have... Well, let's maybe I kinda wanna see how you're organizing your tasks after after this and like, we don't need to keep keep everyone on on for that. Somebody we can do a screen of it and i'll take a look at those.

Client 5: Yeah. I've been keeping notes of the people that I've been marking that and, like, the people that I've been taking my like label off like, the Kelly's list meetings been keeping it, like, track of that. So I have other their info.

Client 4: Okay. Yeah. I mean, we can actually just go through your historic calls up for this. So Let me dial you on Slack. I think I should be free and about Ten minutes from now. So if that works long gonna, Yeah.

Client 5: Okay. Cool.

Client 4: Okay. Cool. Well, then I can I can let you guys. Get back to it. And just as an Fyi for these stand and we're doing them every day, They don't doesn't necessarily need to be a full thirty minutes. Like a lot of... You we can probably keep these efficient and just, like, kinda knock knock it out and for in five to ten minutes. Unless there's stuff like, you know, you guys wanna go into a deep dive on that's that's sort of why the thirty minute The thirty minute allocation is there.

Host 1: Mh. Okay. Awesome.

Host 1: And I I I love the specifics on you guys have meetings you booked and I have a interesting metrics here have for desk. Yep. You guys tomorrow.

Client 4: Yeah. If... If you guys have any kinda like, if... Anything interesting here on the phone maybe, just or not down. Like, haven't have have a another of stuff that you potentially wanna go through on on these calls, like objections, things are going market. Now, some of the good questions you guys brought up today about workflows. So definitely marked it all down and and hold go through it.

Client 2: Cool. Sounds good more. Thanks.

Client 4: Yep. Cool. Talk to you guys line.

Client 6: Part. Thanks. Like Can you...

Client 6: I wanna go through some... So dude I don't even I am I have been out of the sales loop on a from the Analytics perspective. Where where is the data living that would be, like, top of funnel, you know, like, calls, emails that we're sending that kind of like kind of like, Str sdr level data Or does that exist right now?

Client 4: That would be an. So Oh, and you just gave rachel a seat for analytics purposes.

Client 6: Right? I could just probably log in is Is that right?

Client 4: Oh, it's... Can you say that again?

Client 6: Did you you create a seat for rachel lancaster? Sir.

Client 4: I just got an approved this morning, so I'm gonna create her one. Yeah I just haven't gotten a chance to get to yet, but I did just get under a new license for her to use?

Client 4: Could you... Did you want one as well? Or Yeah.

Client 6: Did do do they they charge on a c basis? Because if so, like, I'm thinking is we just use one for analytics.

Client 4: A on a c basis. But what I told So I got the hiccups. So what I told Rachel yesterday, is that I have two new Sdr I think that are gonna be starting. Got up so bad. So I got two two sdr that Are gonna be starting. So So, like, those could be reassigned. If you just needed it for, like, a week to do an analysis, because it sounded like with her it was sort of a short term thing. Or she just needed to to connect live comm. So They they do charge seat. So Yeah. Guess it would just it would just depend on what what you guys are looking for and how long you need to do it. Like, if if you have a, you know, like, that Sorry. Not not live. Like, I think it was five tran. If you have that integration, and it's, like needs to constantly be maintained that might it makes sense for someone to have their own license because you need to do it through an Ssl login, so it that makes it harder to share passwords.

Client 6: Okay. Okay.

Client 6: Okay. Well good though. Well, cool. Maybe I'll I'll I'll chat rachel. I mean, yeah, we we'll want that data flowing into into five tran or into, you know, for through five training our the warehouse. Ongoing. So... yeah, maybe it makes sense to make make you, provision a seat specifically for for analytics.

Client 6: Yeah. Alright.

Client 6: I guess I would what we can do or, like, if it's something where it's like not super crazy to manage like we can do.

Client 4: I got. Screen share or something, and I can kinda set it up initially. And then if there's, like, requests I can tweak it, whatever works. I mean, the end day it's it's latest money. I'm you know, I'm I'm very to managing budget so I could get a little I tried get, like, a little street around there, but I'm happy to do with whenever whatever works for you guys.

Client 6: Cool. Cool. Appreciate that. Yeah. I think my guess is that, like, we could just connected to, you know, like, Quickbooks I I in hear, for example?

Client 6: But Can you still hear me?

Client 6: Yeah. U. Yeah. Can you hear me?

Client 4: Hey. Can you hear me, Jericho?

Client 6: Yes, sir. Can you hear me?

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah. Just... It's my audio device went out. But I was just saying that I'm yeah. I mean, whatever But whatever works for you guys, like, as long as Harrison of the extra licenses. I can cool.

Client 6: I know I doubt will need extra licenses. Like Fire tran, we've been able to use to somebody's existing account for everything. And most of them have just been mind. So So I think we can probably just, like, use your account or rachel the, you know, maybe just an. Probably it'll need be that, so probably your account. But, yeah. We'll i'll i'll i'll coordinate with Rachel. Think she may already be working on it anyway. So Coordinate with her make sure we got what we need that.

Client 4: Got it. Okay. Very cool. And then Question. Do you know what integrations are we working on right now because I don't even know that like, or just was something that's currently in the works, and then I think Brian had mentioned it on a on but call at the beginning of this week?

Client 6: Yeah. So Yeah. We've got gentle from a platform for perspective, you know, like alternatives to Shop got gentile and big commerce. That are pretty close. And then other integrations we've got smarter, which is a bring. Also similar to recharge. And then gorgeous.

Client 4: Okay. Smarter... I remember that there was a one that I couldn't couldn't make up. So that's cool. And that's like, not for partnerships. That's just so that they can It's it's a more of product feature.

Client 6: Yeah. More of a product feature. We're actually Brian who... Have you met Brian on? Do you interact with him much?

Client 4: On... like, the group paul's is not not one I'm on.

Client 6: Cool. Yeah. So he's he's super solid. So we're gonna we're gonna probably, like, for Brian's suggestion, Like, be more sort of hands on with, like, using our integrations that we're building is, like, a partnership method, you know, like as what happened with smarter we just use their like, publicly available Api docs and then turns out there's, like, private Api two that have, like, special stuff you can do if you reach out to them. Which would have been valuable for us to do originally anyway. My guess is most partner... Most integrations won't be like that, but he was talking about, like, you know, having just like a, you know, kind of a partner of perspective like, we can go to them and say, hey, like, we're building this integration, like, what do we need to be aware of can we, like, work with you guys. Then potentially, like, you know, having some P around it and the were like, c customers. So think that could be a good... Like, what when we get to that point, we wanna involve you know, the the partnerships team to to, like, be in those conversations, I think as well. But So... yeah. So right now, yeah, It's pretty pretty like just like, you know, an additional feature for our existing customers, but we wanna use those to to also hopefully get some partnership at least leads, you know, Okay.

Client 4: Got it. Yeah. No. That's that's good to know. Because any anytime there's... Well, if we know there's an integration the works it's just good to mention that on the Like, for Gorgeous, for example, and that's a pretty big common when used. So Yeah. All good now.

Client 4: Okay. Cool well, yeah. I'll I'll let you get back to it. And look through when I see other meetings coming through. There's gonna be a lot more meetings then press accounts in January. Since they usually need to push stuff off and until then. So there should be some some good ones coming up in.

Client 6: Cool. I. Awesome. Appreciate, Mark. I'll I'll reach out about i'll outreach stuff questions.

Client 4: Sounds good. Talk. Talk about.

Client 6: K. See mark.

Client 4: But... Yep. Okay.
