Client 2: I Go Done, Good.

Client 3: Okay.

Client 2: Alright, matt.

Client 3: Good. Good. Relax after the don't.

Client 3: Definitely kicked it. Have have some lingering you know, gunk trying to come up, but it's it's all gone. Feel.

Client 3: Hole again.

Client 2: So joke man. It's funny actually, well, not super funny. Hope for hear from the other room, I wanna got sick and, like, Now she's got, like, kinda like, the second wave coming back she's just kinda like, a busy week last week. It's like, dude if you don't. Stay on your on your game and, like, keep fighting off, man, it'll come back. It's It's not job.

Client 3: That's such in a long time.

Client 3: Like, I was this The only thing that made me feel better was resting is That was useless for almost a full week.

Client 2: Not used this around here, but useless, yeah. I that's a good way to describe when you like that I feel out. Sub, sub george, k.

Client 2: Alright. Let me see if got some other str coming in otherwise we can kick things off here in a second. Check a quick calendar and then we'll jump in extra good use of the time. Get a lot to cover Cool. And yeah. Nick's probably jumping from that internal hand off call. So we'll give them a couple seconds. Do have an ice breaker. Perfect. She goes here. We'll, we'll go when we kick it off, but thinking about what's on your your holiday list this year, but something you're for Christmas or whatever it is that you're celebrating start to think about back as well. The alas I wanna go around the horn. Yep.

Client 4: Everyone happy Monday.

Client 2: After Monday. Alright. We'll wait for nick to file in on a hand off call, but we'll jump in given the short time frame here. So I'll check share a quick side guys got a couple updates for you from t meeting and some stuff that was discuss then, and then we'll get right into it. So let me pull up the slides and we'll jump in here. Alright. So we talked about you'll see some Yeah. Prize we were talking about. We're to come here on this one guys, but bear with me I'll we'll good for the port nine first or I should say more important items. Wanna call a couple quick things from team meetings. And I set it out in that recap late Friday. So please take a look at that, but there is the vendor level forecasting list as far as opportunities that were lost from each person in there. So Please go in and not reach for those accounts. I know a lot of you already done this so far. Checking with you guys on Friday, but they just wanna make sure two plus one that's since I for forgot mentioned this in meeting. He was released for us. I mean, we lost so many deals to this, and it's frankly be one of those things that held back a lot of partnerships that were ready to go. Otherwise. So please jump this list, make sure you guys are attacking these. We'll back the some thursday to to validate that. Also wanted to flex value sessions. Again, you guys all are all aware of this. We got a template set out. If you haven't seen that template I know that those of you are going to already have, but just make sure the team meeting deck that I sent out has the link very straightforward pretty much what you all put together last time a good one make sure that it's filled out and out to date leading into that session. Questions there? Cool. And then on the team going price, so really when we looking at the numbers and we'll go a little bit in where we're looking on the the month and some of the data in our Thursday meeting. But to set a pretty aggressive goal for us six hundred thousand dollars on the month. So the data backing for this goal is that that would be our best month ever. But as we've seen lately, obviously, our buyers are very, very intense. Also have as much like stage pipeline entering a month as we've ever had. So we have a lot of win deals. I know Anecdotally speaking to you all that there's a ton of warm things in everyone's name. So this goal especially considering like where we landed you know, last month with, you know, knocking on the door of of without essentially this goal itself with several days knocked out and not as much pipeline going into it. So I think it is very attainable and something which i'll be be marching towards And took Leaandra suggestion on the the custom swag on the sweat pants. So we got a lot of tops Mosaic, but figured if we can get the full kind of jumps it down that'd be good. So We'll get some custom going the design. I'll i'll I'll fly case something cool and and unique on the sales side. But these will be kinda decided in a couple different brands. There's like, a a pretty cool kinda champion sweats that like, look like they're like, some premium, like, she material that I'm could be good for us. So more to come of here guys, but, yeah, six hundred k is a very aggressive goal, but with we have it is attainable. So we'll make this via the North star for the month and then keep in mind, we all have the Ac sp. So a lot of additional tenants on top would be obvious they incentive up on our comp plans for for this month. Cool. As far as weekly updates guys list transition is now. So Pretty typical. We have the strategy sessions here. So I think what would the best use of this time is call where you need help this week primarily. So if you have calls, make sense to be looped in on, please flag those, and we'll make sure you have the proper resources on them. And then we will jump into the pipe... Review for deal updates. Because we have the strategy sessions here, I think the the best use of time is just give us a high level update maybe call out some things that would maybe take a couple days to to, you know, true up before the strategy sessions or maybe even much between down this afternoon, if you have one later today. Just to kind set the stage, so we're doing less recap in those strategy sessions and more so game planning for plays in the future. So go around the horn I'll pull up the pipe report. And again, we'll just go where you help this week. Then we'll jump through each deal after that. Any questions here on the hello? Cool. The report here and we'll start Janet. One second. Salesforce makes me sign in again. Second. Awesome. Cool. We'll go first here. So Leaandra, first and Definitely important. What you asking for for Christmas or the holidays? And then we'll go through first where you need help and then your deals.

Host 1: Cool. I don't really ask for anything for Christmas, but I guess. There's this like, radio frequency device that I want for my face, so I probably buy it for myself.

Host 1: It's okay.

Host 1: Knock space.

Client 2: I love it.

Host 1: Oh go ahead.

Client 2: Oh, yeah. And sorry, It's just actually before we go into deals. If you could just called... I mean, calls in the calendar this week where you need help that that'd be best first. Just to allow the type reviews later. So feel free to.

Client 2: Yeah. Just look look at the calendar first.

Host 1: I added Frodo to this Hr demo that we have with the Cfo. This will be our fourth demo with them. Obviously, I have marks on it too. I don't know if that's for overkill, but it seems like it's a big deal because it took them... We did two rev offs calls, and then, like, obviously, when with the finest person start, so I just think it could be helpful to have an exact person on it. But it might be I don't know. It's two of them and then there'll be three of us. So when you.

Client 2: Is there on their side?

Client 2: Cfo. Nurse we're hoping to manager.

Host 1: Yeah. Okay. Cool.

Client 2: Cool.

Client 2: Yeah. That sounds good. I'd say if Frodo's aren't able to make it feel free limit on that happy to to tag along, but that should be good if if Frodo is able to Cool. Anything else you're tracking?

Host 1: That's pretty much it. I mean, I have the brands you could call with the... With the Ceo and I Maximus on it. I don't know if we need Frodo on it. She's a Ceo, but at the same time, don't know if it's totally necessary. It's gonna be, like a twenty k deal. But aside from that, and I just, like, first time meetings, you're on the cloud I need support on and then Yeah. I think that's about it.

Client 2: Okay. For Brands. What's the agenda?

Host 1: It's just a demo for the Ceo.

Client 2: It's like a thirty minute demo?

Host 1: It's a full hour demo. I think she's gonna have questions because she does all of forecasting or at least we have we're bunk out So hopefully late stages, this one's been open since August and she told me it's gonna take a while. So we're making sure that the ceo knows like, hey, we've been talking since August so this is not like a quick decision. But, yeah, I think we'll just do full demo now.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. I'm happy to join. That sounds go. And especially if we're they've been getting tired for a while, we gotta probably talk about price changes and all that. I could be good to subs that.

Host 1: You wanna live? Yeah. The one thing with this one also is that I brought this up a long time ago. They like, quarterly in credit cards. And I'm kinda gonna ask if, like, hey, do you definitely need credit card payment? I don't know that we can do that, but Yeah. They they always take whirl. Yeah.

Client 2: Believe our staying on this last time, George was we'll another way to do it. I still tracking that right or Do we wanna push back on on at all?

Client 5: I mean, I think try to push back as much as we can. If, like, we really have to figure out a credit card situation, We can probably do it. But definitely another deal. Yeah. Okay.

Client 2: Cool. Awesome. Okay. Moment. You said that's all good as far as meetings on your side list?

Host 1: Yeah. And then, like, you know, Voodoo we have today when you reference call. I think said something about scan, but I didn't get confirmation there So I'm follow with her.

Client 2: Perfect. Cool. Awesome if you wanna jump in and just hit on your deals, we'll probably stop at stage three given time. But... Yeah. Feel free to just give us the high level on of these deals, so we're not recap during the strategy session if you don't mind.

Host 1: Yeah. Click note. Don't wanna get anyone's hype up for this one, because I just have it in here just in case we can't talk through a deal that's gonna start in q two, so it's definitely not gonna be ten for in quarter. But he just hasn't given me a direct yes or no yet and I texted in this morning. So just trying to see if there a chance and if not, then i'll just close it out. Eight based. Yep. I have check with Dan today, extended the same pricing through Friday and then pretty much said like, hey, you know, we need to get this done. He... He thinks we can get it done, but as you know, not necessarily most our reliable person. But hopefully, it won't till Friday. Gotcha.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. We can keep it yeah networks to speed there. Again? What's laced with Do?

Host 1: Voodoo, we have a scoping call, but afternoon, we need the reference call, they obviously need be scoped.

Host 1: And then he wants the two free months at twenty k. So just the one free month. And they are teeny Tiny. So you know, whatever we can do there. But Yeah. But he said pretty much, I mean, like, from him... His perspective he's ready to move forward we can do that.

Client 2: I think think I'd support that. If you wanna to send up that approval for Joan George at the threatened myself just in exactly Frodo, or will that be great since we're kinda breaking.

Client 2: Yeah. Roles on that one, but Yeah. Makes sense mine instead to create an air further and lives with their concerned.

Client 2: So Cool.

Host 1: Onboard, not looking so good anymore. They had Like, their nets consultants have been essentially like doubling their cost every couple weeks and being like, hey, we have... Like, it's just been, like, creeping up in scope. And latest I got from him was that their initial go live dated, February first, is probably gonna get pushed out. And so this is gonna get ups, you're aligned to, like, a december signature in January thirty first start date. So he's being super responsive. It just sounds like other things are taking priority being that sweet. So that one is not looking so great anymore Okay.

Client 2: Interesting. Yeah. Something just to be aware I've got and we're seeing this across the board that, like, next week. You know, implementations are really slowing on our cycle. So Just be cognizant into it. I mean, we've gotten kind of far down with some folks who realize that the eleventh hour that... Oh wait next suite actually gonna take a few more months because they're just not super plugged into it. Sometimes just different folks work on the that's implementation versus doing their planning. So Yeah. Just I would say this take those objections very seriously. Work... I mean, we've tied probably six deals the last two weeks that heard implementations are north of a year and dragging and scope creep to hold, you know, getting Cabo that is less than ideal for another project being brought on. So just...

Host 1: What should we is like Should we, like, pay less attention those deals, like, run them and then, you know, have this happen or, like, what's what would be like, the best way to deal that.

Client 2: Probably case by case. I mean, I think in some of your examples Leaandra we, like, again, my name morning quarterback backing here, but it could have been good to just validate where they're our implementation more head on and, like, ensure that it's in a usable place and you know, maybe get in front of those objections more head on, Like that's a couple of ones that you bumped into, other so are different and it's, like, completely outlet field. So it's a little bit tougher to say, but Yeah. I'd say just so being cognizant of that. It's a key objection early on because two, you know, next week going live soon, as we've seen for a lot of these deals, does not mean that it's live as what we'd consider soon. Yeah Makes sense we one even with the account recently that thought it was live and turned out to billing modules taking a few more months I mean able just you know across the board. So something be aware of And with that, I know like in the past we let Sdr set up demos when they're just have a deal signed at the very least, but, like, are implementing I mean, might be something to consider on that into too because like, sometimes people do push back, they do wanna see a demo, but at that end the day, like, it does seem to be holding up deals the eleventh hour.

Host 1: But...

Host 1: Yep.

Client 2: Yeah. Good. Keep moving, but I'm fine there.

Host 1: Cool Anchor, I you enjoy that tax. I sent them a note this morning, and just said, Hey. I saw that. You know, That's probably priority. They got hacked everyone else who wants to know. And they haven't been responding. I've been sending actually, like three emails last week, but maybe a note from Frodo would be helpful just different voice Yeah. They're just being kind of unresponsive right now.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. We can try to that one in our session there's definitely a button nuance there.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: health conference hr.

Client 2: I think we're good on. Yep.

Host 1: Yeah. And then.

Host 1: Forensic like we talked about ambassador labs, I have a check next Monday, so it's getting back from going dark for a couple weeks just because she told me she needed time and she did, but she set up a call, and then I think that's all I have in stage three.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. We can go ahead and pause there. Yeah. We'll go and Pause there for now. Donna we try directly these strategies steps to make sure others can jump in here. Cool Cool. Thank you, Leaandra. Alright. Nick, you would be up next. Don't forget. What you ask for Christmas or the holidays? And then jump in. Where you help this week and then deals.

Client 6: Yeah. For Christmas, I probably Just need new running shoes, You know, these shoes nowadays are ridiculous. Question than two hundred. So That's about it.

Client 2: Nice. Better than socks, I guess.

Client 6: Yeah. Good.

Client 6: That's awesome.

Client 2: What's on the calendar this speaking we need to support on Now we're talking a couple, but It's not necessarily even on the counter it's more like...

Client 6: I think these might more come in the the strategy sessions of, like, plays so might not be best to spend a ton of time on mine.

Client 6: For calls other than code, I'm just meeting later today discuss feedback pricing next steps. Demo went really well. Cfo just like has no concept of planning tools. We got them on our last for the first thirty minutes. But I think he'll rely on the team make decision. He asked about security. So he accepted that invite, but still ways to go kinda just we'll be selling him, see if this is something he can move forward with. And is on board with. And then t later this week. So all the other ones are gonna be plays coming from strategy session.

Client 2: Cool. Sounds good. Cool. Do you wanna jump in on trinity and go on list.

Client 6: Yeah. Trinity, I... You these are the guys waiting on Sas off I sent them an email about the pricing changes of, like, can we get some time on the calendar for me to let you know of the changes though nothing no new update here from their adviser saying, hey, if I'm helping on this, we'll be done by the end of December if I'm not it looks like that team... Like, the Ceo will probably be done in January So trying to get time with them to explore, like, a sign lock in and push out. So another play we might run after my just sent them an email last week is it maybe a touch from Jail or something, but Yeah.

Client 6: Trying your time on their calendar.

Client 2: Yeah. Was just to say it sounds like taylor made for some that you and I i've been hitting on, but it comes from Frodo and it just gets received you know differently.

Client 2: So I'm following there.

Client 6: Cool.

Client 6: Stream. Yeah. So didn't hear back from them yet. He was supposed to swing back last Wednesday. He said, Mosaic was still his vendor of choice. Heading into his budget meeting with their board I'll let you know if we can move forward. So I'll touch base with him shortly. Wanted to give him a little bit of breather because I was pushing so hard end of the month. So I'll touch base today or tomorrow. And see if it's good news, or bad news, if they didn't get get the spend approved Got.

Client 2: Who's the who's at there?

Client 6: Their board.

Client 2: To the board.

Client 6: Okay. Yes the board the approving. Yeah. He's their new Vp of finance. And he said, the their conversation with the board went a little bit differently than he his painted, had their meeting on Wednesday and that's when he was circling back with them on that to approve the twenty k.

Client 2: Okay. That's right. Alright. Thank you.

Client 6: Yeah. Content. Status here have a scoping call, so that one's like I don't think to have a ton of money, but we'll keep that moving. Ten. I met with him. Last week, it's between us and cube and pretty much just told him like, hey, Have you Like, is Hr billing and Crm data important to you. Which that open up the conversation to be, yeah. It was project like you should probably double back with them because did you see that the demo, and he's like, no. They just called out the integration. So and more place to run here. He's swinging back with them. I got some time on his calendar a week out, but I just tagged up the Gong on Friday of, like, quotes from him showing him all the integrations in app and said, hey, this is the things you could probably walk through with cube. Offered up that we can introduce him to someone here if, you know, he's really like torn, but more placed to run, and I can fill in more on the strategy session.

Client 6: But have some time on his calendar next is is heads down this week, curious in your like kinda know we were talking about this last and your list of things to attack with Q.

Client 2: Did you include like, the actual just maintenance. And so the model is in, like, rolling things like, just rolling your period forward your actual and all that because that that's one of the workflows that we had sent to us recently that was probably the most absurd I've seen. At one of our competitors. Was that on the list at all?

Client 6: Not necessarily for that because his biggest q was like, hey, I see the flexibility and uncomfortable with spreadsheets. So I see the appeal the cube of things I may not be able to do within Mosaic So that's where I'm torn.

Client 6: That's where it just led me to, like, open up the competitor cheat sheet.

Client 6: So Thanks for that and was like, cool these things are important.

Client 6: You did they show that to you in app. So he's swinging... That's what I attacked. So no. In short no. But like, Okay.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. No Good. Yeah. Something think about. I mean, it's it's a little in the weeds, but it's just... It's something that definitely makes their it's steps them one step further away from being like a platform. It's just within the Excel setting because you like brought forward. It's it's pretty weird. So Something think about, but I guess, if these not directly helping. And I'm sorry. What was the next step Enrique again exactly did you have something on the books please you guys?

Client 6: Yeah. I do. I have... You know, I told him I'll give you enough time to swing back with cube to explore those things. I'll tag up the gong for is needed a refresher of everything we walk through and we're sync up on Monday, the twelfth you know, if I need to help him with pricing catch up on kinda where his heads up on things. But that's Monday the twelfth that dining name.

Client 2: Cool.

Client 6: He said he can move forward that's.

Client 2: Yeah. Cool. Sorry. I saw thing his name is sergeant. Started laughing anything else since that call we have with them on that I think that was friday right?

Client 6: Yeah. No. I just chatted with Maximus told him the game plan while we need to whip up the five minute exact demo and then shoot our best offer over and then call that one.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah for Frodo and George contact at Athena. Their bank. Forgetting who it was was caught x nonsense and, like, having my liquidity issues. So they're like, they're not to I believe withdraw like, several million dollars they need. So it's debit businesses not a good squad.

Client 2: but don't don't tell anyone.

Client 6: Yeah. And and it's odd because he reports to legal and legal doesn't really get. And he's like, I know it's weird guys, but legal doesn't really get why I need a tool. And all of our money's is pretty much held up right now. So he just said she your best shot. They... They would probably ideally like something months month where we said No way. We'll just shoot you our best offer. And then we'll leather chips fall. Cool.

Client 2: Alright. We'll keep you one. I'm met with her last week said it's between us and she really likes plan full.

Client 6: I just said get sow, and we'll talk the She just said, yeah, Like, it we are gonna be conscious heading into the next year and I said, well, Do you have s sow w from them? Like, no software is pretty similar. I was like, okay. Well, get s sow w, and then we'll talk next week.

Client 2: Perfect. Cool. Abe quickly highlighted that. But Else sir?

Client 6: No. Yeah. You got that call with them at one Pm to review demo feedback data went really well. This was just completely outbound. So we'll see if we can swing it.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. So keep bringing on these and then got a couple more and then we'll last Yeah.

Client 6: Lot one I can hit on then we someone else can take it take over, Frodo, I met with The maxi team last week to let them know the pricing changes. And Dan just said, okay. Let us swing back with our Ceo and and see what we can do. So you know, just show them your email, Denisha and they were gonna swing back with their Ceo to see if bacon reel in budget this year, but ideally, they'd like to kick off like, sometime probably February any for you again.

Client 6: No. No. Yeah. They just gotta get back to me if they can move forward this year.

Client 4: Cool.

Client 2: Yeah. I know judgment plugged in here before. I mean, it could make sense This one those times where it's like, same message from us just delivered from Germany resonate a lot more. So I would say, penny feedback or if maybe we're in a low at all. I know for projecting makes sense. I'll about what that exactly could look like. But I know we have some connection is that already. So sense. But...

Client 6: Yeah.

Client 2: Strat question.

Client 6: I just be a touch from Frodo to say hey. Like, move forward this year, I can offer this price because we're still at full price. So Yep. Same for Ax Frodo, you you didn't hear back. Right? It probably ball's in their core to make a decision I didn't hear back already.

Client 4: I also to pink Colombo Webber, the president of Max this morning on something different so I'll have a side combo with him.

Client 6: Okay. Cool. Glad it. Let me do.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. Nick, we'll catch up on here. I know you got a lot in the stage three. So we'll keep move make sure everyone else gets a chance to go. But, yeah, saw a canary and then I'm seeing some others here that we'll we'll chat about Cool. Appreciate that. Lot and play for you. Awesome. Selwyn, You wanna go ahead and jump in?

Client 7: Yeah. Just got cheap plates. That one should be good. Caitlyn said she's giving the exec team until Tuesday to ask anything and she should sign by Wednesday. Yes. That one it it gets bad.

Client 4: Is that a business model work from Jose? Or we scared at all? Did it gets scoped?

Client 7: I guess we do need to scope it. It's just like a it's... They just small subscribe options, but, yeah, we can do the the scope we need to discover thing for that one. Yeah. Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. If you could... If you and I'll could sit on before end day, let's make sure we're getting in front of that we're plan catch up on any of the expectations or scoping on that side.

Client 4: So they don't actually set from.

Client 4: They just so a subscription to get data.

Client 7: Yeah. Yeah.

Client 4: Okay. Should be fine. I would still scope it down.

Host 8: They should give us a free subscription.

Client 5: How how is this not Ben sc?

Client 7: We just had, like, it was just like a couple email communications and then She just wanted a contract So they they on stripe.

Client 4: I'm assuming they're gonna be on stripe.

Client 7: They they're not skype. They have a Crm that's gonna be a Csv. Upload customer but Yeah.

Client 5: I guess something kind questions like, was there a question of this not needing to be out or Like, feel, like after a conversation on Thursday, I just wanna make sure there's, like, no black and white areas of what does and does not get good scoped and the feels pretty down the middle of gets scoped.

Client 7: Yeah. I think it was just because she was like, a repeat buyer. But Yeah. I hear again.

Client 2: Cool. Well, do a reminder everyone, like, any deal. Regardless of what it like, smells like looks like needs to at least have a quick chat with your Essay on it, and this one would be a candidate to produce for Johnny i'll sit down run through those documents, understand what he's trying to be run to the data team. Yeah. I agree that but i terri shouldn't that out fine, but just with that new Let's make sure we're being comprehensive and running every deal through that regardless of what the, you know, model it is because there's always a ton of nuance underneath the may. Maybe janet that we'll what we're missing. So You guys go friday they just so... I think they're gonna sign Wednesday, yeah. We definitely gotta get in front of that and if the scoping call in needs necessary when can now is, like, a, you know, pre implementation stat, whatever that is, but let's just make sure we're digging than that. Cool. Selwyn Light on Ren.

Client 7: Yeah. Ren, we have the pricing call tomorrow. So, yeah. You're on that one. And so Yeah. Just gently pricing with them. I don't think we really need too much extra support there. Wave. Yep.

Client 2: Agree. We can do a plugged in that I think the next I see is building link. Is that what you're checking?

Client 7: Yeah. So you're building links, Cad Cad and I are gonna talk to them So they're on like Quickbooks desktop and they might buy nets and so we're just trying to convince them, like, dude like, it's really easy to switch to Qb. We can help with the nets speed transition. Because that's probably gonna be pretty far down the line. And we're also just trying to really handle this one this guy really likes Mosaic, but he doesn't strike me as someone that can get anything done by himself. So we're, like, really trying to handle this one across the finish line. So, yeah. Chatting through that process tomorrow to get some extra buy in and then gonna really try to not let him present pricing without us getting in front of this is we because I'm I'm just not confident in this guy. Making things happen.

Client 7: Without.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. I'll i'll get I'm good to we'll strong. That one I'm got a couple ideas. Well we'll just give me sure we can hit on this. Yeah. The phone for the strategy session. Cool. For me.

Client 7: Cool. Metrics, We have we have pricing and just follow questions with them tomorrow. They had some questions around, like, road roadmap things. They got really hung up on the inability to put, like, multiple forecasts on one chart. Which is a little unfortunate. So I'm hoping that's not like a big deal, but we're trying to works through that. As like, a potential objection. So that's one thing we're trying to kinda, like, isolate minimize on the next call a little bit, like, let guys we're getting all these other things. It's not having three lines on a chart really gonna be a deal breaker. So that's something we gotta work through there. But, yeah, we pricing. In like follow questions tomorrow.

Client 2: Mh.

Client 7: Or sorry on Wednesday.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, it's stuff on timeline for this future to my understanding. We you have some good mock on this though? So may help individuals probably good to them to see it that we've already mocked it up. I wouldn't commit a time months too. It's my understanding, but we do have some individuals on that if you that let me know.

Client 7: Is we Yeah.

Client 2: This go once. We actually actually whole slide on, I believe. I'm one of our road map decks, but Yeah. Plug gets me after i'll. I'll get on it. Cool.

Client 7: Stack here you're pretty a loop of that one. So Daryl needs to catch up with Coo after you know, they're doing that kind of like, little how. With the rest of the team. And Should you just cad on this one did you have it already?

Client 7: Yeah... Cad been doing some like back channel for me. So, basically, where this one's at is, like, Dale daryl, obviously, like, huge Mosaic fan, he's like, working to, like, kinda build out a business case with his executive team. This is one of his big, you know, like, thirty sixty, ninety day plan items to get it rolled down January. So this is like a see one start initiative.

Client 7: Got the main, like, go unquote blocker, who's not like, a major blocker, but more of a skeptic is there, like, Biz ops leader who's maintaining dash words manually. Yeah. I mean in, like, Power. So we had we had a good conversation where trending in a good direction with Daryl. We just yeah. I need to get them to kinda, like, commit. So if he doesn't say anything, he's it's... Denisha in loop on this one. Like, he's we're in a pretty good spot with this one. We see some, like, year and incentive stuff. You haven't even talked about, like, some of the pricing changes thing. So have send business leverage we can pull. With this one it probably tried to get him in in quarter.

Client 4: Alright. If you me on slack with him, so pass on. To Is it?

Client 2: Yeah. That's definitely do I think. Selwyn can put hit on the stream and clan and we'll Get Rabindranath in here.

Client 7: Yeah. So stream Unfortunately, this was probably a closed last. Where I been Denisha up hell mary. On this one. But... yeah, Just totally. After the after the demo, cam vision, running like, a year end play with them with pricing and everything. Afterwards glance, I do think I wanna bring Raf or someone into glance, just of, like, another person to get in front of him. I was like, back channel with a guy who recently left that we in a sales cycle left. And he seems to not be concerned about the plan implementation process. He said they convince them pretty well, that would be pretty easy. So definitely wanna get some like, fun in there and get a good, like, list of questions. To attack them with directly. Because, you know, hearing from Raf definitely sounded like a pretty hell experience. So wanna it kinda relay that to them yeah.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah. I I think one thing... I know we've I think I believe you sent before Selwyn sample like, Tc three year summary? Doc is helpful. And I think what it really communicates indicates well too is just them thinking critically about maintenance cost in, like, yours too and Onward just because oftentimes that statement of work the platform includes it's just looking at year one and not any additional incremental services that'll be needed. So really be good to send out maybe, you know, while right on Raf. Kinda shows that gets them thinking about cost in additional years that may help if if they think the process is easy well. What about the cost that you probably haven't thought about? Got we Ask Selwyn what you asking for for the holidays?

Client 7: Oh, I I need some, you know, shoes. I use some just walking shoes. I need some like boots. Big shoes. Christmas for me.

Client 2: Alright. I look forward has seeing in the the new swag after the new year. Right on. Make sure you get some shoe that match sweat pants once we get six hundred okay.

Client 2: Awesome. Rabindranath you're out, man. Good. Let's go holidays first, and then we'll get in.

Client 9: Perfect well, I'm in the same boat of Selwyn, due lore is what I'm asking for. Running to work workout two foods. Everything.

Client 2: Alright.

Client 9: Awesome gonna be really even approved that's after the holidays.

Client 2: Cool. Yeah. Alright feel free to... I guess, first on the calendar thing that's compelling. You wanna make sure to get left in off compelling.

Client 9: It sounds like Denisha you're looped in with all the additional pricing calls, this week yep on one of the demos that vividly Worth noting, Frodo it's on opportunity created, but you and I have a call with Hers at all stacks later this week on Thursday, so I'm gonna send him a note. Day just to make sure we're still good for that call.

Client 2: Cool.

Client 4: Awesome.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Opening then these deals here vital first.

Client 9: So vitally, I mean, you're pretty looped in there dillon and just trying to, like, get him back aligned here to see if this is still salvage after the what's an ideal rollout with the Poc? So we could talk more on the strategy call, but I think this could be a good time where we engage Frodo. Like, hey, missed the mark on that first step, like, how can we rebuild this here?

Client 2: I know you think dustin and said like he was understood and was down at keep trying, like, what what was the any action from that nobody's that he's on us.

Client 9: So the action from that notice, on Gave him Ke on calendar like, hey, we can do this live with you. Again now that we have, like, the workaround. But no response there hope that, like those times. Okay.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. We got session that one.

Client 9: But...

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 9: We still pay.

Client 2: I mean, got guys busy. Yeah.

Client 9: Yeah. Exactly. It seems like he's opening the email. We can check if he's, like, actually attempting to log in, because Kevin Ke can tell us that Total Go.

Client 9: So Matt, you're pretty looped in here. He's just negotiating with us kinda back and forth with this last note. I think. We can talk more about the strategy session. He's already looked at with Frodo. On a thread might be worth just another ping marriage just to keep him engaged from a sides Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. This is Taylor made for, like, Frodo sending some notes to help us negotiate just because guys obviously like, leaning in and just wants a deal.

Client 2: And so these so you other wanna play the game, but it's playing the game more than just by anyone. So Yeah. Let's definitely think about like Yeah.

Client 9: Yeah. But beside the trick, like, on the technical fit there.

Client 9: Could be good.

Client 9: we've got some pushback from Soogrim, the Cfo, he's like, hey, like I'm kinda worried about my bandwidth. You know, like, I can stick with Excel for, like, another month or so or two I can focus like on his go to market function because he's helping with sales. So again, talk more in the strategy session. I think this would be another great time for Frodo to hop in here. You've already sent him a note, but I think that would be helpful. I'm already alluded to the pricing changing. Given his past concerns, that could be a good lever we can pull there.

Client 2: Okay. Cool.

Client 9: Down follows so quick update here. There was a flurry activity this weekend and that was going back and forth with they're finance Jason. So his last update yesterday was that the east app meeting this week, and they will have a decision by the end of this week between us and place So he's seen the ton of content that I produced like looms like comparison charts. I think our last piece to add here is a note from George today or I can, like, Introduce George. And say, hey, last piece here. George Is used place. You want one final thing on differentiate we can leverage that.

Client 2: Okay. I tried to analyze you use that tool how How was the scheduled one time?

Client 5: I've have not actually used bliss.

Client 9: Like quite unquote.

Client 2: I guess Halo legit is this what is George gonna speak to if we What the strategy session there.

Client 9: I mean, I don't know if he'll bite it on it but just one piece. Just to can that more.

Client 2: Okay. We'll catch up later on that one.

Client 9: S you and I are locked in there need to come up the new pricing proposal with them we should just send that out today for him or his tonight Yep.

Client 9: Super conductive may have seen this note this morning still nothing from the east staff. Next to want to move forward to us, but team is taking rocks there. So we could get another note from Frodo to Leaandra their Coo. Coo. And see if she can give us an update or insight there.

Client 2: Yeah. It's probably time for something like that. And we gotta squeeze it on pricing. Obviously, with the pricing changes. So I think that kinda come off with these dudes the next few weeks in my opinion. So Frodo doing that probably would help, but something for the strategy session.

Client 9: Cool. Yeah. He's engaged at least. Scroll down quickly here. So vividly, we have a demo with the rev ops team on Wednesday year on that Denisha. Should go pretty well. He's bought in, but we need to knock it out of the park to sell the Rev side, which more often than all we do. Is that final step to move forward in December. And the last one just quickly here. Two minutes, Zest have the pricing sync tomorrow Denisha. This is the second pricing call or last week's. The first one. So we're gonna present both to your option in a one year that we can iron out today Not see that.

Client 2: Cool. We can pause now around Get a couple others that we'll chat and just right off this meeting on all good.

Client 2: And I know Plugged in on yours, and we just met pretty comprehensively on ended of the last week on that one. So given the time we can go ahead and and shut it down here. Just the reminder again, guys, forecast sheet is due end day today, please. A good look at that. I know you guys have all up the pipeline prior. So I think you for for doing that.
