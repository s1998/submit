Client 3: Yeah.

Host 2: Yeah. If if it's really... If push really come to serve, I guess I'll buzz out you and I'll take a flight, but so far it's been buying.

Client 3: Yeah. Nice.

Host 2: Alright. Well, thanks again for taking the time by by way of of quick introduction, i'm I'm flow and this is brent we work at the tim flow. And this is my cat been... I just filter care. Well, perfect the regain execution of my hands. Yeah. We work at at team, what we're working now on a sales tool. And so this is really just us, like, trying to catch up on the industry to learn the validate and ended players and and so forth. And I believe I found your name online. You will writing a review for Larry on g two if i remember correctly. So, yeah. I mean, this is really just us looking to hear more about you and Cla what you like about it, what you don't like and salon in. Sure. We again we can kick it up with... Can you tell us a little bit more you you do And what does your company do?

Client 3: Yeah. So I'm a senior account executive for q. Q is an experience management company. They measure experiences through various software tools and full service resources. But essentially, you know, it's a tech company driven by the desire to help stakeholders measure and and quantify experiences. So that could be for product land, employees, customers, and and any other stakeholders or concepts that are involved in in market research or additional components like that. So I'm particularly focused in the marker research side of product brand and additional primary research. So that's what I do. I work with Cla day. To forecast and and track sales opportunities. I work with it in at at various levels pattern two primary primarily ways is tracking my opportunities and the about the sales stages that they're at. The forecast categories and next steps, the next steps process is really nice in there. And and then changing, you know, closed dates is really great. All of this is synced up to our salesforce. Crm. So we have direct you know, updates that go back and forth through those. It's nice to be able to look at all of this together rather than having go salesforce because honestly salesforce side is confusing and not very intuitive. And then forecasting you know, looking at those opportunities and changing the percentage on the forecast that circles up into know my forecast totals and seeing know what's closed and what's what's sitting out there an invoice. And then and then, of course, we do... a low verbal high in our forecast so that tracks on a on a weekly basis, we need to to update that as well as a month one and month... two verbal forecast. So that's kind of, you know, the cadence and the the use that I have with with Cla I know my management team uses that even more. Like, they're like, constantly on Cla. I probably look at Cla, maybe once a day. But So as it goes up at a managerial standpoint in q, people are really dialed in and using it constantly. So I think from the rep standpoint, it's it's helpful but it's more kind of a tracking and reporting type thing than than actual full component of our job. Like it is an a managerial standpoint within contracts.

Host 2: Yeah. And and I'm sorry, you mentioned you used Cla to to forecast and and watts that was the second one.

Client 3: Forecast and just manage my opportunities. So So I have a... I mean, you wanna see my list, like, share my screen. That So, like, this is you know, all the opportunities that I have. We got seventy seven ops working with right now. That I... When we do it, like, I I have different views, So So we'll do a top deal review on a weekly basis. That looks at the deals within the quarter. And this is where, you know, we we work within like, our and next steps and our next actions, And then, you know, we... What's really nice is our company likes to have us use like, medic in there. So over here in the details. We can just fill out medic right here. I don't have to go into Salesforce. And fill that out which is huge. So So then then also look at a deep dive view of all my apps which is the seventy seven there. We can look at lot lots of times, I I sort by closed date, and just start from the beginning there or do you know, quarter relief on that. And take a look at what's coming all in the pipe, right and And then I also like to look at, you know, like, my deals one they're just quick. And easy right here. I can see, okay. Here's everything that I've closed right now. Etcetera. So So that's how we we use that on off tracking in in in say the top deal review, I'll be going through the next action make sure that the sales category is correct and up to date. And that the sales process is current. And then the sales process correlates with the sales percent forecast percentage. So that if these don't correlate then the off will be flagged in Salesforce And you know, we'll need... It'll tell us we need to figure out what which one's are off. So So anyways, that's how we kinda move these through our pipeline we use these different sales process stages in here. And move those along. And then forecast categories. These are the categories we have. And then we go from a and we have various percentages depending on what that is. And that's that's our that's our opportunity tracking process that that we work through. No. So any questions on that?

Host 2: What do all these call mean here?

Client 3: The colors?

Client 3: Yeah. So the red is if something's moved back or less. So if the... If the close date moved, out from when it currently was.

Client 3: So if it was, at December second, for example, and I moved it to December sixteenth. It's indicating that things have been are being pushed. If that quota a relief amount. It has decreased from the original the amount that it was in. Then it turns red. If it's if it's moving forward, if it increases, then it turns green and then I'm not really sure why, like, it turns blue versus green. To be honest with you. Because this will tell you right, It move from upside to committed. And then this way, eighty to ninety five percent. So So that's what's cool is like, Like, from a management standpoint, or you know, as a rep. I I'll move these all around depending on what what's going on. But as a manager, my manager can come in, and just see like, oh, what happened here? Like, they'll just hover her over. Oh, it moved from probable to committed. So And it sounds like a historical It sounds like for you, the main job to be done of Cla is like, it it it gives you an easier way to look at your pipeline into update pipeline is that the idea?

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. tracks my pipeline gives me full numbers of what's in the quarter or what's in my total pipe? And you know, for example, right now I can I can flag you with stars if if I wanna... If I wanted to really drill into, like, okay. Best case scenario I'll say, you know, this... If this one closes and this one this one, you you know, go on and say, like, give me a total of, like, okay. Here's my here's my low And then I can do different calculations on my verbal I could look well best case. I'll get, you know, a hundred and sixty more this quarter. With with what I've dialed in not counting the the opportunities that look to pull into the quarter that moved out. So So that, you know, there... There's just a lot of different forecasting components. My baby daughter here is coming to visit And so I see have...

Host 2: This is like a view hello How old is he?

Client 3: She is seven months.

Host 2: Oh, wow. Okay. So you did you create these view yourselves?

Client 3: I did create these views, but these are credit department managerial standard ones within Q. So So everybody creates customized views. And it just you know, I can title these depending on what I want. And then I can create the filters can edit the view in here And so within here, you can change the the filters. And then Let's see. So it's been forever since I've changed the title of this.

Client 3: Without with other you we to use here.

Client 3: Yeah. So the top view I do top deal review My one deals So top deal review is for the entire rest of the quarter. One deals are all the one deals in the quarter. Deep dive is for all of my pipeline. Regardless of the quarter. And those are really the three. Three views that I always look at. I could look at open deals as well, but that's very similar to my deep dive So So... yeah. Those those are the primary three. Look at Yeah.

Host 2: Mentioned Yeah. Go ahead. That that was actually my next version to the forecasting.

Client 3: Yeah. So forecasting, It's pretty simple. This is something we handle on on a weekly basis. But This is you know, what we what we call for our quarter depending on But you know, we use our a weighted... And so Cla has a weighted formula not really, you know, I think it's proprietary. So I'm not sure what that what that is as far as exactly how it weighs that, but mostly from what we under stand is it factors in different percentages. On these numbers here. To the total quarterly versus the pace at which to the deal is moving towards its closed date. So you can see this is the weighted number down here versus the total number So that's or for this, weighted it's it's telling me that Probably come in at you know, forty one point three six percent of my quota which is this number And the way we we'd measure it according to what our previous sales forecasting is working. At the end of the first month of the quarter. We wanna be at fifty percent of our weighted at the end of the the second month of the quarter, we wanna be at seventy five percent of weighted. And then going in. So So in this case, you know, I'm well below that right now, but I have what I've done is I have a lot of really variable deals that you can see that I'm factoring into my high So that's where it's not weighing on my weighted. Where, you know, if if those Rfp and those large deals that I have out that I'm working right now on don't come through. This is much more likely where I I will land pending the ones that I will This is where I went. So that kind of how we forecast. And then this is this is the number that we forecast up. Where we're gonna hit at month one at the end of month two. And then we you know, where we end the end of month three as is these numbers of course.

Host 2: So... And and when do r verizon send B x mean here? The the header?

Host 2: Yeah. So works is q specific stuff research services and then brand experience.

Client 3: So b x is a product. That we have that we sell And then research services is all kinds of full service components as well as are design market research suite. So Yeah. That's that's just specific And and what kind of signals does Cla use here to estimate these these forecasts.

Client 3: So the only thing that Cla is calculating is the weighted component. And again we... you know, it's partly proprietary as far as their their formula, that they use, we don't know exactly all the components of that, but we do know that it weighs where the deal is how long the deal has been in its in the pipeline where the deal is at its forecast category in sales stage. In relation to its close date. And saw forecast percentage. This will be forecasting fifty percent right here. So that would be showing thirty percent. And then so in general, the forecast will be about fifty percent but sometimes it's a little different depending on if if the deal has been in a pipe for a really long time. And Cla saying, well, it's it's not likely that this will close. That the pace that you're going to or or you know, different factors. That way. But in general, it correlates with the forecast percentage number.

Client 3: It goes in. So so I could have in my total Yeah. Right now for the quarter left, I've got a hundred and fifty seven thousand nine zero eight quarterly. Right now it's factoring in about a hundred and eight thousand twenty two dollars and waited pipeline. That I could add that it's saying would be more likely for me to close. So I would add that that hundred or was eight Yeah. Hundred and eight to the two twenty seven. To make you know, a waited of three fifteen.

Host 2: Have you used anything like cla people at at previous companies?

Client 3: No. Nope. I hadn't... But my previous hour or was kind of a dinosaur. So they were they were intact account or like an ed tech company but they were a publisher as well that been around for seventy five years and really had really old school sales tools. And so I mean, Cla from... I... I'm pretty aware of the Saas world as far as, like, standard tech stack for public Saas companies and hilarious, you know, in the top. As far as sales forecasting. It's it's really becoming you know, industry standard Of course, there's a few other competitors that are that are out there. But, yeah, it's becoming very common and Sas. Companies to to see Cla around. So I think it's It's just kind of like a a thing of sales leaders used it at one place and when they got hired, they saying they say, you know, hey, I wanna use it at this place.

Client 3: So Yep think it's kind of a... it it it has kind of a community type component to it where people know what they know and so they wanna use that and they're comfortable with it. And that's that's how it grows. Mostly, I think well without with with all favorite and least favorite things about it.

Client 3: So I wish Inquiry you could There there's a few specific details that we need I wish you could on here, was it's more about managing ops. I wish you could schedule you're like your next meeting. Right here. Where where in Salesforce, So go to a Salesforce opportunity, This. So say, say, I mean, here Or a lot of my opportunities, I'm required to have scheduled next event, on there. And so you've gotta go into Salesforce and just you know, plug in I got it. A meeting and set that up set the date And day like subsequent meeting. Right I really wish I could just do that in Cla. Where it would be another field or be in the details sir, right like this one has the details So I could just have the same, like, an a a third tab that to do or wherever that went? Yeah. To do this exact thing that that's happening on this tab. That would save me a ton of time. And kinda drives me nuts. And What else is? Is another thing. So what I really like about Cla is I can update the next actions and the Met bonnet fast. But again, this is specific to my role it's specific to, like, what's important to me. And so know I know it's not not like something that bothers me in general about the platform. Platform seems pretty straightforward. There's a lot of things that I don't use in Cla. That potentially others use, but I also know that others don't use a lot of all the features. And one issue is, like, in the analytics. Like, these pulses, oftentimes, like, the data is like not right it doesn't sync completely correct with with salesforce or, like, the dashboards here. This will show you what. Was talking about scheduled next events. Yeah. Like, right here. Like, this is Cla telling me that I haven't had any interaction with the individuals for seven days thirty days in the next meeting with any of these whereas I actually do have this in in Salesforce. So it's not pulling the right mh the right data. And, you know, completely useless. Right? Like, when when the date is not right, then it just... It's broken. You can't use it. So So that's been you know, any issue. And so we just completely don't even use these. These widgets here. So those those are some complaints there. Again, things that I like about Larry is it's it's simple to use straightforward I can pull the the details that I'm looking for quickly. It's a lot easier to to look in view information about opportunities that in Salesforce. So that's what I like about.

Host 2: Do they also have... Started a cell on their website they... They have like a con conversation diligence gen thing. Right? A sold of a call recorder? Think.

Client 3: Possibly, I don't use that at all. We use our outreach. Or excuse me. We use Chorus. So we do use outreach as outreach tool prospecting tool, but But Chorus is what we used for call recordings.

Host 2: Yep.

Client 3: And again, pretty pretty... I mean, call checks is pretty on point with It's kinda Saas industry standard platforms. We don't have, like, too many that are super unique most what other Saas platforms or companies use. Because so How how do these two tool compare and usefulness to you between cla and course So Chorus, I rarely get into.

Client 3: Because it's just kinda my cadence that I don't go back and listen to calls but it honestly has to do with the type of rep that I am I have like, wait too many projects and opportunities I'm working on at one time that I don't have time to like, go back and, like, listen to a call and, like, systematically take notes up from that or or stuff like that. So what I'll do what I'll use Chorus for is basically, some coaching opportunities with my manager saying like, hey, take a look at this call. Tell me where I could do better here or I thought I did. Pretty well in this in in this call here. Or if we need proof about something like, hey, we talked to the client about this. catch it in the call here. Or sending the clients the recording of the call, which they like as well. But other than that, Sales development representative said our company used Chorus a lot more. With just like getting coached on their calls and different things like that So I use Cla, like, a a hundred percent more in than a use course.

Host 2: Makes sense. Great. Okay. So again, to summarize, Cla helps you manage your pipeline, update quickly have like a bill that you'll don't need in and forecast? Is that is that the idea?

Client 3: Yep. Correct.

Host 2: Great. Awesome. Well, I think there's all my questions Do you have any questions Brendan?

Host 2: No Awesome. Alright. Well, thank you so much, i. I super appreciate the time today.

Client 3: Yeah. You bet. Happy be B of help I'll check out Team The t flow.
