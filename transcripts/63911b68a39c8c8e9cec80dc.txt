Host 1: You guys, Everyone.

Client 2: George.

Client 3: How we doing.

Host 1: Denisha you're letting the beard grow out, my my playoff here.

Client 4: It's totally closed the deal. It's not gonna cut So please please close the deal because it's getting worse every day.

Client 3: It might have everyone already. Cool. Alright. Well, I think we have enough people to get started hopefully as won't. Take a full thirty minutes, but wanna to get everything everyone on the bone and just do a refresher on our qualification process and kinda determine what is and isn't qualified an opportunity. So Definitely not the most straightforward of things. Obviously, three reality is or business does have some pretty meaningful limitations, but hopefully, we do come out of this with a decently black and white understanding of what would be and what wouldn't be a qualified opportunity and when we should actually like make that termination and move something forward in Salesforce, because So haven't had a chance to check out, on my sense. Guess we'll just spend kind of the first you know, five or ten minutes walking through the slides, but I think really, the hope was for people to have a chance to ask questions and especially bring up cases that are not straightforward and we can talk through them. So everyone can get a good feel for, you know, some of these more complex situations and and how we wanna handle him Any questions or other comments before we start Cool. Awesome. So hopefully, everyone is familiar with our qualification guide, you know, first slide here pretty straightforward or just kinda, like the high level of how we define our Ic. Yeah, there definitely could be more detail in here. But rather than like you know, trying to get everything just in the definition, figure it just easier to come up with this kind of check system and and how to think about things. But largely our Ice you today is, you know, B b Saas businesses have technology that we can support and to reach certain size parameters like, those are the three big buckets of things we wanna check for. And, you know, really, the complex one comes down to technology and industry. Any questions on this before I think Like obviously, the meter this will be This kind of check system here, but any just questions or things that don't make total sense around this definition. Sweet. Alright. So basically, like, everything on this slide should flow into how we've defined the Ic on the previous one. But there's some non obvious things that can arise, which hopefully this helps kinda shed light on. But basically, anytime you're trying to make it a determination on, you know, pay whether or not this company is qualified, And I think this is also just kind of like a helpful gauge for should we be prospecting into certain companies even ahead of time? These are kind of the three big questions, you know, we should kinda be asking yourself But the first one is just supported technology assuming we've actually had a conversation with the company And so the role we're trying to operate under here is we have to be able to support all of their core systems that drive both Op and top line. And so basically, meaning like, we can actually provide the kind of core fundamental value, of Mosaic. Most of the time, this will just be European Crm. Systems, sometimes the my billing system. Sometimes it might be a data warehouse. Maybe it's actually, like, their own homegrown solution or their product they sell has like, key more data. Whatever it is, if it's fundamental to how they think about historical or forecast op and top line, like we need to be able to support. And so if The answer to this question is now, then, like, nothing down here actually matters. It's just automatically, we now cancel the technology shouldn't qualify opportunity. The one caveat is, like, Csv workaround. And so, like, in a situation where maybe we can't support their Crm or their billing system, but we can you know, that they are like willing to go the Csv route. Then that is an acceptable thing to qualify. And so assuming like we don't lose the deal because of it. So that doesn't mean to say, like, if we lose this deal once you got qualified, we should only qualify it if, like, specifically a technology the inability to support technology or the Csv are not acceptable. Then we should just disqualify it at Csv is an acceptable alternative we could still lose an opportunity do the price for complexity or whatever it is. And then we just, like, closed lost that for missing features or whatever else it might be. Any questions on the technology piece? Cool.

Client 4: Not a question george, But just to to reinforce that. I know that we we get this site slash bullet point on Work acceptable. I know we are reached out with, like, Hr. Obviously, you can see us of your data. But I know like the data warehouse piece has been catching people up because it's like, well, you know, we've never connected the two and with a lot of customers who have them. So, like, is this you know, un if it's a need and yeah. Let that lot bullet point out there, like, talk to the client if Csp is acceptable, And, you know, a lot of cases that will be the case then you're good to march forward also stating that these features are coming out soon, but Yeah. Just calling out particular my data warehouse based and I tripped up some poke three currently. Just the holiday with the client... Cs if is feasible there. And their business will we'll oftentimes tell about the case that they have they weekly updates because they're super transactional then. Okay. Maybe it's not feasible they have to redo their Bi system something like that. Okay, Like, we get un. Or if it's just that's where their hundred customers live as in snowflake and we could do a Csv then perfectly plus march forward on it. Also, surface education this year. You guys get your out so we can that for you.

Client 3: Yep.

Host 1: Quick question that's kind of on this, but also more scope related with cs upload. Do we have to scope that or is it hey, Cs is a good workaround and, like, that is the alternative if we can't support, like, I don't think I really understand what Cs upload entails from the customer side or like from our side.

Client 3: So it definitely is something that we should scope. You know, what it entails for our side is basically, like, we don't have a live integration to that system. And so in order to get that data into the system, Like, the customer or we have to actually, like, on a monthly year usually usually monthly. Basis, like, actually get a raw export Csv file from the customer and have the data team actually upload to the platform. We are starting to open up Csv So that, like, customers can go ahead and upload it. That's like a big part of cory builder. And so that's been, like available unlimited release But the reason why, like, it for sure needs to be scoped it's included here, like, you're ever wondering, hey, if something needs to be scoped, definitely to is your resource to go to And the reason why we need to scope it is because we still have to drive custom logic off a it. Most of the time like if it's a billing system or if it's Crm system, and that drives like their hair or other metrics. Like, we have to know what fields are relevant inputs to what metrics. So the data team just wants, like, before we say, hey, Yes. Csv is a viable workaround. The data team will need to actually go look at that Csv understand what fields are there is the data normalized, like, are there any issues with that. To make sure that we can support it And then we'll use that Csv to then drive usually like some of their metrics in the platform. So definitely something we would wanna scope, if we if the customer is okay with with using that as a workaround.

Host 1: Got it.

Client 4: Yeah. I know this is just subscription up some folks recently because we're like, Well, we thought Salesforce was harder. So what does that not need to get scoped? Like, a cdc can just be totally random in format. The guys we scope customers it out where they like, tele clean and they have like, one tab or customer or, like just different boxes, like, literally just boxed off of, like, the customer data and it's like, okay. We gotta like get this like a you know, a table format. So, like, That's where it's i actually gonna be, like, more custom complex than Salesforce So when we get the table built out could be easier, but that's why, like, see how the Csp piece that would definitely warranted into the the data prussian say generally it what for into to the.

Client 3: Cool. Okay. So industry, the second big question here, what's, like, alright awesome. I know that technology is not a blocker, second biggest bucket is an industry. And so, like, the the high level question here, like, this is a B b Saas company, yes, and it's qualified, if it's not it's un, the definition of B b Sas is, you know, basically, cloud delivered software and the pricing models can be a little bit varied like most of the time, people just refer to, like, straight subscription, there's also instances where, like, we we would consider usage based models or, like, some type of subscription plus usage. Based hybrid i just rolling up into B Sas. And so again, like, thinking about prospecting like, if this looks like the business model, great. This would be a good company to prospect into if we around a conversation time of business model, the business model falls into this bucket. You know, it's qualified. But if there's anything else outside of that that exists within like, the business model, then we'll we'll think about that kinda through through this third check. But anything, but the important piece here, is, like, as soon as something does not fall into this definition, then Like by default, it is not just be to be saas it is b to b plus something else. So we'll talk about that a little bit down here, but just the default days, if it doesn't fall this definition. Then the default is to Like this is un. And we can't support it. So obviously, if we, like, go through, you know, say we get on the phone to someone turns out, they do have some other element of it of To their business, and we can't support it. And, like, that component isn't gonna be a roadblock. Then we can, like qualify and moving it forward. But we we shouldn't be doing that until we're absolutely certain that that piece is an an issue But I guess just to walk through this one, I've kinda covered most of what's in here. But so, yeah. Third check is, okay. Say B b Saas has some other component that might be hardware transaction services payments. Like, whatever it is. It's supporting, like, the inability to support this other type of model that exists within their business is a non starter. Say, like, they have a hard subscription hardware, but there's a hardware component to it. If our inability to, like, model their inventory or hardware revenue or whatever it is. Is, like, the reason why we can't support the customer then we said un. So usually, you know, there's say, most of the time, these probably are gonna be un every now and then we run into into a situation where they have a rubber piece and they don't care. They have a transaction piece, but either like, we can pull that data from their Crm or it's or the billing system and like, we actually can't support it. But by the defaults with these positions is to un until we have or typically at not keep it in states zero not followed by it, until we have, like, determined that either we can't support or it's not a blocker to to deal. So any this is... I feel like to probably the most questions like I get, like, hey, this seems like a B b Saas business or this is b to b plus something else, like, how should we handle it? Any questions or like edge cases, or examples, people wanna bring up and kinda, like, talk through how it would fit into this model Yeah.

Client 5: So this is where, like, I'm most confused because it seems like we we can support these sometimes and we can't support them at other times.

Client 5: So there's a ton of gray area. And then there's a ton of variability for D queues versus ninety d queues. Is there a way that we could just split them out? And have us like, a different round robin for them. Because then that's i feel like for... reps that's the biggest thing is wanting to get a quality for meetings in less, like, bandwidth to take another disco That's just like, an immutable as a good example. Like they're, like crypto, but they just had, you know, a use case of whatever, like, swift, you know, they're whatever. You know, usage based component and at a vacuum those could have been d queued and, like, those are less revenue because, like, oh, it's not b b Saas. It's not a great lead. Versus Yeah. So that's that's where my biggest confusion is. It's like, do we wanna be just saying hard no do we wanna give them a chance, But then if we give a chance, does it take another spot, So this is this is this area where I most can... Just have the most confusion on So I I think a big point So the answer is, like, yes totally, like, it's definitely a great call.

Client 3: We don't wanna be turning away. Opportunities that are Good fits. Or maybe, like not the best fit, but we can't support and it could be business. So that's a big process changes coming in January. Like there's gonna be a big rework of the inbound process and the number one goal and focus of those changes is gonna be to, like, more efficiently service non Ic customers and, like, do it in a way that doesn't mess up people's ability to get, like, b b sas opportunities in around Robin. So for sure that is coming. But for the for the time being, Like yep, if it's not b be Saas today and over the next four weeks, like, the model we're operating under is, like, we should be pulling those from the cataract. We should be giving the person the ability to opt in, but otherwise, pulling them out And so, like, hopefully, we are able to ahead of time, recognize like, hey, this is does not fall into this bucket, if it doesn't fall into this bucket, like, probably pull from the calendar But as soon as we get to the meeting and like, actually take that meeting, it it will affect like, you d queuing it? Doesn't actually help your round robin choices anyways. So it might we end up for whatever reason taking the meeting we we should with like our best of ability try to make it work. Or at least in the sense of, like, understand if it could work. Just because, like, why like, you're not gonna get any more meetings just because, like you move something from sage zero to to q. I like it's still affecting the round Robin. Can get, like, usage based models? Would fall under like, b to b. So, like, as we start to break out non Ic versus Ic usage based models will still fall to Ic. So there's definitely a lot of moving pieces here. Big update in January will come or it'll be a little bit easier to handle these, but, you know, for the most part today, like, we should all be taking business models at fall this category and if for whatever reason, something like subs cracks that exists like this. Then I would just, like, refer back to is that and on start or not.

Client 6: All Would help to you is the the qualification in scoping slides. Like size twenty three and twenty four. The new ones we... Well, not new ones, but leveraging those more in that evaluation will help expedite this call playing red flag unit to to get it off. Faster. You know, it's like I think one thing that we can do better. Just a literally all those yellow flags in twenty size twenty three twenty four. Can literally decide for you on that third jack. To be like, this is gonna be i'm call by for sure I.

Client 4: Just to continue on Trying to get all this quickly be wanna make sure we're comprehensive there. Like, Selwyn example with, like immutable once some these it maybe be crypto. Companies like definitely don't expect you guys, like after a pretty minute just go to have like, every data new Nuance and like, every business model very mapped out fully. So they're, like do your best thing you're just discovery to get this data, but it's totally okay. If I after conducted that discovery call you set up a channel or even a fifteen minute call it's like me market whoever. George, and we try to, like, help determine based on your feedback if this is qualified, and then, like, we can maybe ask some questions back to the client. I'm like, hey, we didn't really discuss if, you know, project level modeling was, you know, a need for them, but that would be indeed to know if it's qualified or not ask them, you know, before next demo whatever or today. Before we convert it. So we know, like, where will land. So Like, what you're calling out? Like, it's totally normal like like, Leaandra how to staff company that that's also an auction platform in in a way I like auction company, but I think like a cut of, like, everything that's sold on our app, and that's, like, Okay. That is clearly out of, like, what we typically do. But by validating that is a gap. We can ask them if that you know, they need that component of their business crypto out a great around anything like crypto ledger or anything like that. They don't need it, then, hey, we could we can march forward with that understanding. So yeah yeah. Definitely tough to delineate to sometimes, like, raise the flag, like, for your call, so we can it out. And then, you know, does don't make these judgment calls, like quan call live like like, look in your your team, we can help you guys know where that line is.

Client 6: Yeah. Worth the time because it's a time suck once you start going down the route with, like, demo, follow demos and you know So Have a question on this actually a couple.

Host 1: So One, the timing on this Are you George when you was talking when you're talking about in cloth Qualifier, are you just talking about in general or are you talking about, like, hey. If it's not baby Sas, are we like, if the Sdr organized that, are they taking it off the calendar? Or is it just like flying to ae and the ae goes into it, knowing that, asking them questions, And then we're gonna decide if we support them or is it, you know, obviously telling the customer like, here are the things that we have holes on, are you... Is that okay with you, like, who's deciding if we can support? I feel like i sometimes it is. Customer, sometimes it's like us and, like, determining for them. So that's kind of like a gray area for me on this part Yeah.

Client 3: So I think caveat with all of this, that again, there's gonna be a lot of really big just coming to that process in January, but the way it should work today and like, know has been working previously is when an the inbound demo comes in, that is something that alleging goes and advance like legend is looking for, hey, is this falls Ic, meaning like, what it technology systems that they submit is a a fit. And then, like, do they fall into these criteria And for some things like, hey, if they're under ten employees, like, that should be pulled up by the calendar. By lunch the Sc, if it's you know, over eight hundred employees again same things should be pull from the calendar. And then if it's Like, clearly not b to b Sas. Also something that should be pulled from the calendar and again, like we just kinda send a breakup up email, And then if it's a questionable one, something that looks like this, it's a little bit, like, that's where it's a judgment call. And so we do try to send like that note ahead of time like, hey, what are you... Like, we only that like, what are your key pain points in what are your use cases that you want to kelly. Yep. utilize those eight four. So, we can have a little bit more information to make this judgment call. But if it's clearly outside of these definitions it should be getting pulled from the calendar. If it is a gray area, that is where like, it's hard to determine based on the website. That is a likely situation where we would leave it on the calendar because we just don't know. And then, you know, the ad on the call would be trying to make an assessment on like, Hey. A all these buckets can I should we be pursuing it? Should we not be pursuing it?

Host 1: Yeah. And I think One of the things that I've been running into is lot of these non sas companies that are, like describing themselves as as. And so with those, Would is that qualified because they look like Saas or is it not qualified because they actually aren't saas even though they're pretending to to, like, report on things and the one that I sent you was a good example because it's not even a usage model. It's a credit, almost like a credit services model. So something like that where they have a way to, like, do, like, annual analyze revenue, but it's not... So they say it's Arr, but it's not really Air.

Client 3: Yep. So I think in that... That's a good call that is like, definitely very weird in tough situation or people are, like, trying to brand his ass trying to, like, hap metrics because it's advantageous. For fundraising or whatever it is. But I think like, going back to just kinda these rules like, if this... If it's something that's like that, it's clearly not just traditional Saas. So it is something that is b to b plus something else. So that it's kind of down to the fact like is whatever else that's not gonna to be sas about it. Credit services like, whatever it is that's with that within that specific customer. Our ability to or again, inability to support that is, like, why you know, we like determine that we can't support that. We go back to the customer and say, hey, we can do x y z for you, Op account planning, whatever. But we can't do like, your this piece of your top line because not able to support that if they're like, cool. Like, that's... We need that. You know, which took part ways then bite following this. That means that this other component has hindered us from pursuing that deal, and therefore it should not be qualified.

Host 1: What if custom metrics? Like, our custom metrics, something that we're considering Okay. And qualified or custom metrics something that we're saying hey. We're not gonna commit to that. So that could be a blocker for them.

Client 3: If if the custom metric is Right So again, kinda works down to this like it's that's a pretty similar situation to, like, the dimensional piece of it. So if a b Saas and discount the same way again b to b Saas wants custom metrics, and maybe they all like product usage data per they want. I don't know, Like, ticketing data, Like, whatever it is, like those custom metrics, those like, we would just say no to, and that's like missing features. Like, that doesn't not to do with they're business model or like the way that they like do Op extra or top line? If the custom metrics... Like, we would have to create a custom metric for their Op or top line then that is a business model issue. Like that is, like business is model reason. So we should say that that is un because, like, those custom metrics are are specific to whatever this non Saas component is. Gotcha.

Host 1: So in the case that we are dealing with them like this, are we moving them long stage? Or are we keeping them in stage zero? Until we like to work we find out for her.

Client 3: Yeah. It's a good question. Again, this is not a great set up with the system big changes come in January that will address this, basically just the ability to track non Ic i. But for the time being, it would be great to try to limit the amount of retroactive D gpus So, you know, to the best of your ability and like, what no big deal if this happens? But, like, to the best of your ability, like, just leave if you're not sure, we can support again, going back to, like, Denisha and and Ou point, Like, hopefully, you do... Like, it shouldn't take more than like, two calls. Like, maybe you don't have all the information after the disco. Hopefully, like you're having a conversation with your S get any answers you need on the demo. So I go it's like Max two calls Hopefully, you're getting all the information to make your determination, but i'm tell like you're eighty percent sure maybe it's, like sixty six percent sure that we can support them, just leave them in stage zero, so we don't have to, like, deal with very many retroactive d gpus, obviously, not not great process to have people sitting in say jira of a or it demo not have take in place. And that will be addressed in January with of these kind inbound processes.

Client 3: So just quickly on these. So somebody's these like just quick call outs for some my other edge cases. Missing features like even if it's like, we can lose deals because, like, we just don't have things in the platform. That's fine. We should still qualify those, moving to close lost and just put in missing features as the reason list out, these are our product apps that still exist was i can track. And then dimensional is another example that's kind of similar to, like, the custom first one, where people can, you know... If you fall like traditional B b Saas businesses, you know, maybe they do wanna plan by geography or by product line. And if that's the case, like, we should still qualify that. Like, nothing about that business model. Like, d use the business. It is just like, how it they want a plan, which means, like that's an issue with our financial model flexibility. So to they extent that like, this is a B b Saas business, dimensional, can can be a reason why we lose a deal and qualify and, But as soon as, like, we're talking about dimensional, that is a result. Of a non D b Saas business model. So maybe it's someone wants a plan by Bye project for a services business. Then we're talking about dimensional how that is, like, stemming from the fact that this is not a b b business. So you shouldn't even really need to answer this question. Because the answer to this question is already no and so we know that, like, it's already been d queued at this step. We don't even really need to get to, like, answering this step of the question. I know over in time, I probably came out of that a little bit more use that I entered. So I hope that is how everyone else skills.

Client 3: With you.

Client 4: I think I think well... I mean, I I I'm leaving more educated than I pay the off users, but I can know.

Client 4: I think keep comes open and certainly post, you're not totally certain surface it to... I'd say George myself, Matt is probably a good audience. Just to... It's a... And maybe to get that cons going on it. And then just to reiterate a george said, like the new process that Tl i'm the process is that meetings on your calendar are good to go, they've probably been qualified up funnel with a group of folks that have a really good tight process and then you're good to go. So it's like. Yeah. Just is gets this driven an few weeks surfacing cases before booking after booking or after disco, I should to say, and then we'll make sure you just have clear like, how it all stems from it.

Client 4: Lot of cases that you guys are because we actually have resolved in a way that makes lot sense just know that... Yeah. I don't need to make these judgment calls within a disco. You can do book that meeting sell them as hard as you can get the data you need and then hud, if we turn it d prospect, you know, even plugged yeah. Out just time stuff. Yeah. I feel better about the majority panels.

Client 3: Alright. Sounds good. Alright. Yeah. Well all said done. Let us know if you any questions as i come up, But thanks ever for the time.
