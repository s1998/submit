Host 1: Hey, dan.

Client 2: Hey, Leaandra How's go. Can you hear me okay?

Host 1: Yes. I can.

Client 2: Okay. I'm I mean in the car so I'm off camera.

Client 2: No worries Denisha can't make it he got I guess I double booked him.

Host 1: So just you and I No worries.

Client 2: Worries.

Client 2: Hang on a second. Let me just backing on my driveway right here properly. So I'm I think we're pretty close to just signing off. I need to talk to my boss. I wanna see if he wants to see a demo or something. He might want to You might not. But But you know, given that we're now in December you know, what you know, are we are we looking at what are we looking at in terms of the deal on the table or what what deal gonna be on the table?

Host 1: Yeah. No. It's a good question. So I was wondering if you like, did you have a chance to, like, get any kind of sign off from your boss from Wednesday because technically because I I talk to Denisha about this, Wednesday night, knowing that it wasn't gonna come in, we did get probably get extend through the week but it's Friday afternoon. So I I kinda have to go back if it goes out side of this, So I my goal for this call was understand if on Thursday or or today, you got some kind of answer from him. It sounds like we might need a demo, i That sounds like.

Client 2: I don't don't I don't have an answer for Him yet. And that's mainly because he's is basically involved in product stuff a hundred percent of the time. So there's a couple of things that are top line for him right now.

Client 2: And and he and probably gonna talk over the weekend or early next week. And I'm gonna be down in miami index week anyway meetings. So you know, I anticipate I'm not gonna have a signature for you. I can't sign it today.

Client 2: Yeah. So unfortunately, I can't do that because day almost over.

Client 2: And I knew I'm not gonna to catch him today because done a meeting right now and they're gonna be in there for a while. So So you know, it's it's it's gonna be a December. It's gonna be a december thing. So I just need to know from you guys like, what? And again, apologize couldn't get it done for November, but like to know I'd like to understand, you know, what deal gonna be on the table.

Client 2: Mh. And, you know, I will take it from there.

Host 1: Yeah. You Do you know, like, when you could get a definite decision by, because that will help me just because at that like, I do have to go up for reap approval. And, I mean, strong like, we don't... We definitely don't wanna you know, start this partnership trip off of the right wrong foot and be like, hey, we're taking the deal off table because that would... Is not really my best interest. And, I'm gonna vouch to keep everything the same, but it would help me out a lot just to know, like, when I could commit to getting a signature from you guys by.

Client 2: Well, I mean, Assuming the same deals on the table.

Client 2: You know, assuming the same deals on the table. Think we can get it signed next week. Now you know, assuming the same deals on table. I mean, it's kind of a we're kind of in a chicken and egg situation here because...

Client 2: Yeah. You know, I don't wanna say... Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm gonna sign and then all of a sudden, the deal is different. Then I'm like, okay. Well, that's not gonna work.

Host 1: know yeah anything so I I I do have a call right after this with Denisha.

Host 1: So he just couldn't make this one so I'm gonna catch him up, but if anything, the worst case scenario is it would just go back to what we had before, and I know we didn't have a your deal before. So if anything it would go to, like, a twenty four two free months first year, and then a five percent upset. For that second year. So like the same structure, but just like, back to our normal floor and not below the floor. But assuming we can keep that deal, I it's really more because I maybe I should have done this, but I committed the deal based on the additional pricing incentive for November. And so I just need they hey if we're gonna I mean, they're gonna ask me you, like, if we're gonna send this out.

Client 2: Well i know I don't I know how that works.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: So so if you guys can do it by end next week like, I'll talk to Denisha and I'm just be like, hey. Yeah We just really gonna keep the same deal and we'll get it in by December ninth. And do everything that we need to do before them, whether it is getting your Ceo and a demo or or anything. We're happy to to make that happen. Yeah. If you guys have the time to do that.

Client 2: Yeah. And I'll see if I can get them... I'll see if I can get him on the phone later. But I'm I'm actually on my way to pick up my son right now. So I'm gonna be off the grid for a couple hours here while I think about taking a practice and stuff. So I'll I'll see if I get my boss on the phone later, but I i completely understand. And you know, like I said, i I There's there's definitely, you know, it's not like, you know, it's not we we've already talked about this you I've already talked about this. And we're an agreement that it's something we need to do. I think we just need to get I just need to get a final okay from him. Because, you know, on small deals, Oh don't mind. I just you know, I just suck, but on larger things like this, I do wanna make sure that I have you know, the file green life and them and not. There's there's not any kind of questions or anything like that.

Client 2: I don't want that to come up later, you know, saying, hey, why you do this? Without ask me whatever, you know, that's not just for me or anybody.

Host 1: So... Holy. No. I think definitely get that. And just so I'm understanding, it is your Ceo. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. I Yeah.

Host 1: So I guess if you... like, My ask from you is if we need to get them on a demo, we find some time and do that next week. My ask my management team will be the same deal till the nine.

Host 1: They said they can get put in by that and and then we can go from there.

Client 2: Yeah. And I don't I don't wanna make you guys do a demo or anything, if it's not absolutely necessary like I already showed him some stuff and she was he was definitely interested. So you know, you might wanna see what but you know, what we maybe we could do that after. Just focus I wanna focus on trying to get the deal done so that I can plan a project you know, starting in January and and you know, we get off and running there so. Sure. I just need to talk to him and get get the final okay. Because we had a bunch of things this week that know, that that we signed off on. So I wanna get his final pay on the say good to go.
