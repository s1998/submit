Client 2: You gave the real one second about memories of all the how do you call that... Like, everything falling apart after after while.

Client 2: No.

Client 3: I we thinking about it.

Client 2: Yes. But... Nothing. Okay. I'm to be stressed about the health forgotten.

Client 3: Sorry. Well, we could brainstorm from ideas. What does... She likes... She doesn't like climbing.

Client 2: No ask.

Client 3: That's fine.

Client 3: And you got her a bike last year.

Client 2: Yes. So far with present been on a need based or an opportunity basis, like, for example, the bike it just happen to be available and then you mentally ticket of. That's for the next previous occasion.

Client 2: Yeah. And there is need to some more practical stuff like sam gadgets and for example, wireless headphones stuff like that. I'm just trying to think if have to think something that's more No Not that practical. Or Yeah.

Host 1: If thing is hard, I don't know what it's.

Host 1: You and either So I have to ask him What do you what'd you get them last year?

Host 1: Me? Last year, of Gosh. I don't know. I mean, I asked for, like, the, like, the most basic possible gifts make easy everyone. And so I try to do the same thing for them. I don't remember what I got them. I think I think you got my wife a new macbook That's a great gift.

Host 1: She got me an apple watch And... Yeah. I mean, I don't know. But now we've run out like, the big things. So now I'm probably to skip bunch books for Christmas, you know?

Client 3: Yeah puppy. Because see get also default so just to gig and dog. Worse idea ever Yeah.

Host 1: I don't know about that. That'd be tough.

Client 3: Yeah. We get really tough.

Client 2: I've I've been getting a lot of clothes that I don't like or don't fit. So I just broadcast the message just give me socks. It's it's hard to go wrong with that.

Client 3: That's what I got for my mom last year. I got her, like, thirty pairs of socks.

Client 2: And that's That's practical.

Client 3: It is. And every time I go home, it's the one thing I never pack. So I always end up taking her socks and bringing the back.

Client 3: I needed to help her replenish So are easy...

Host 1: What I've been doing is getting, like, them a tickets like event or something like that.

Host 1: So it's like, a one time thing, they actually don't tend to use that though. So I think that's a bad idea Like, once time I got them a gift card for a really fancy restaurant here in Grand Rapids for my parents. Like, I don't know what to get them. You know what I mean? And, like, two years went by, and they did not even use the gift card. So, like, I think that was Yeah. You never know what to give people.

Client 3: Mh or like, tickets, like a comedy show or something.

Host 1: Right? Seems like a really simple thing. They just gotta use it.

Host 1: You do Nascar?

Host 1: Yeah. So like, three years ago, we got them tickets, like, a Nascar. And they did go to that. We started doing like the the tickets thing every year, but you know, we can't get them to go for some reason. I have no idea why. Probably because, like they're age or something.

Client 2: Yeah. So it's if it's a fixed day it's you you have to know their free at that time.

Host 1: It's like a weekend, and it's, like, a month ahead of You know what I mean? So it's like a very possible thing.

Client 2: We got my parents and tickets to to something. I think it was a theater or something like.

Client 2: And it turn out just that date they were traveling to where wherever. And then we had to change tickets, find somebody to actually use them became the whole.

Host 1: I think it's a good idea. I mean, I would like that, you know, I would go.

Client 3: I you. Yeah. Yeah. I think parents are hard.

Host 1: Yeah. They have everything. Right?

Client 3: Yeah. They have everything My parents don't like anything. So They're really tough. They're extreme, they're like, extreme minimalist. And so that kind of makes it really difficult.

Host 1: Where they from? Where where are they?

Client 3: They're in New Jersey.

Client 3: Right. My dad's a builder. And so he's, like, really they're both really into craftsmanship transmission.

Client 3: Oh, that's a good thing. Any crab show. I know. It's really interesting. But they're building a new house. We've been building it for like, two and a half years. And but it's it's also like their retirement project. It's it's more than just building a house like they've are really planning every minute detail of it and researching every material and everywhere they're getting things. So it's taking a while, but we should be moving in in January February.

Host 1: Let's soon.

Client 3: Mh. Yeah. I mean, we've been saying that we thought they were gonna move in last January. So Like, last year, I got them gifts for the house. And I think they're probably over the house right now, I I think that, like, they're They're having a hard time getting the Ceo. Actually, the certificate about occupancy so they can move in. Like, the town is like nit taking about certain parts of the steps going up in the sidewalks and they're like, we can't give you until the railing is like raise half an inch and now it's just like the tedious part where they wanna move into the house but the town is being difficult. So I I think I'm gonna stay away for house gifts and maybe do more of an experience so they can k.

Client 3: Side of it.

Host 1: Yeah. Probably... The plan said the project is coming to an end.

Client 3: Lee, you gotta meet my dad. There's no such thing as the finished project.

Client 2: I was gonna say in general, like, building the house that's never of done.

Client 3: No. It's never done. I like, he'll be like, help build the house and it'd be like, I need to build a boat to go in the house now. And, oh, now I need to build this for the house. It's like, everything there he... He's like a... He is a project person. And it's never... Things are never really done. But it's gonna be really nice. It's gonna be Like, they designed it so that they could age into the house, so it's... The downstairs is like, master bedroom, master bath, kitchen, really, like no stairs, the upstairs is the extra bedrooms in the the bathroom.

Host 1: for the grandkids. Right?

Client 3: Mh. Oh, yeah. My niece nephew you have already declared their rooms. They're really excited.

Host 1: List, if their minimalist, maybe they you can get them something like W Sa or something like that. You know what i'm talking about sounds like...

Client 3: Really word my dad uses.

Host 1: Oh, yeah.

Client 2: Nice. What was that?

Host 1: W sa I think it's like a Japanese minimalism Like their word for minimalism.

Client 3: Yeah. But it's also like, nothing is really perfect or perfectly like, things in nature are perfectly symmetrical, but they're not perfect.

Host 1: Yeah, like, perfection is imperfection kind of thing.

Client 2: U.

Host 1: I guess that's more of what it is instead of the. But I think they kinda go together.

Client 3: Mh. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, w shaker style.

Host 1: Yeah. Sounds really cool.

Client 3: Yeah. I I'll probably send pictures house on is done because it's been such a thing. The last couple years. Please they they, like, sold our our childhood had home they sold like harold home. To move into the beach house, which my dad also built the beach child's like, four years ago. And the house is... It's really like a it's like too bedroom in one bath, Like, really small. And our other house is, like, four thousand four hundred thousand square feet. Like, my childhood home was huge. And so they really really downsize. And now I think they're both just ready get out of each other's hair.

Client 3: Yeah. A nice home. Say yeah.

Host 1: Is it is on the Atlantic?

Client 3: Mh. Yeah. So they live in our beach houses is seaside Park. Which is right by, like, I'm Island beach State Park, and then that's what you call a barrier island in the island, separates the mainland from the ocean and then the bay is between the the barrier Island and Inland. So they... They're... The beach house is on the barrier Island. And then the house that their building is in inland a little bit more. But it's on both the Burning bay and the township river. Still. So there's, like, lakes and base and and the ocean. There's a time that... There's to do down there. It's really fun.

Host 1: Sounds super nice. So always get it like a beach house and be on the water for a while especially in the summer. Right? I'm sure you're down there all the time the summer.

Client 3: Honestly, I don't know why I'm here. I... It's like there's so much to do down there. It's like, sailing. My mom serves and panel words and Like, all the toys you have all the... There's kayak, there's snorkeling and scuba diving, fishing, Like spear fishing, but something I did, like, two years ago, with them, but I wonder how it is done there compared to, like, Reykjavik because it's kind the same thing, like with my parents are on a lake up here in Northern Reykjavik They Jake, they just built the house, but they're kayak they're on leg all the time.

Host 1: So it sounds like a similar scenario, but like, probably way different. You know what I mean being up here or compared down there. And obviously, There the four seasons? Yeah. There's four seasons in Jersey. So I mean, you're probably mostly out in the summer. Because, like, up here they basically just closed down the lake house. In the winter because there's nothing to do up there.

Client 3: Mh. Yeah. Sounds really similar. Very similar honored.

Client 3: Which is great. Yeah. The older I get the more, I just wanna do things outside.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 3: Like, nothing else matters.

Host 1: So it's like, get away from the laptop in the phone.

Client 3: Right? Yeah. What have you have you been exercising or getting out at all?

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, winter, so, like, less but last year, I gotta I get a peloton. Was like let's let's see how that it goes. So, like, it's actually really difficult to go on. Right, But I have been doing it. I'll like, listen to, like, a blink or something while I'll like, jog for, like, thirty minutes. So that's nice. For the winter. I do as much as possible.

Client 3: Mh.

Client 2: I've never been able to make myself exercise indoors. Never get the motivation. Going out, that's easier but during the her.

Host 1: I mean, sometimes, like, I'll have a lot of energy like after like, some calls lay in the afternoon something like that and you, like, run it out, but I can't like, go jogging out side because it's like, thirty degrees out. So we'll i'll just hop on the treadmill meal and, like, run for twenty minutes in it's really nice.

Client 3: I've been doing like, a thirty minute run at three o'clock day.

Host 1: Okay. Like is a good time for it. It's like the perfect time to work out. Right?

Client 3: Because it's too dark at five.

Client 3: I can't. Don't feel safe for any in the dark. So And then it does give me, like, a little boost of energy to finish my work when I get back.

Client 2: Yeah. Can you run when it's a color outside? Or you did it that on treadmill?

Client 3: I do it outside.

Client 3: It's it's... It's like, Still... I mean it's not that cold here yet. Not quite freezing yet. At three o'clock. So It's still tolerable. I I think that might be difficult in, like February or March.

Host 1: Still do it because you're still running. Right? So you're like, warming yourself as you go. Yeah. That's that's true.

Client 3: Yeah. It helps me focus when I get back to work because I do start feeling like a dev at that time.

Host 1: It's good to clear all your thoughts when you're run probably same thing for you simon when you're when you're climbing, maybe us runners over here. Do it differently.

Client 2: Yeah. But claiming I cannot get it in the middle of the day.

Client 3: Yeah.

Client 2: You have to find the the climbing wall and to get there and then go back.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's don't Galadriel I don't know how this free but like, it's really tough to do it in the morning, and it's really tough after work has done some, like, I all this energy, like, in mid afternoon. Perfect times. Take a break and, like, go work out fraud then go back to work. I don't know why it works like that it's just the best time.

Client 3: Yeah. It just... And helps me focus more too. Like, just getting a pulse work workout in. Helps me come back and refocus. Someone do you need a partner to a new find?

Client 2: Depends your client. If you do boulder, which is near the ground under maps, then you don't and also a lot and almost all right now have a delays. Where it's a some automatic device at the top. New attached to it. If you go up, it just takes the the rope. And if before it lowers the down slowly. So we can go even if you don't have friends.

Client 3: Oh, that's great.

Client 2: Yeah we That that's a big problem in university because I always depend to go with somebody, and and there is a good chance that somebody will cancel me.

Client 2: And never was able to put in the the target hours for of practice for a week also do rock climbing?

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Actual Rock climbing.

Client 2: Yeah. That that's the best during the weekend it's really The most refreshing is like meditation. From houston seems like dangerous at times.

Client 2: Depends what you do. There so many ways to do it without being dangerous like a talk. If you climb things that you already know, that are clear, if you have somebody more experienced with you, to put them the role before you go. That's super safe. To do. The dangerous parties is when you're leading. So there is no rope ahead of you. You have to go past clipping point. And if you happen to fall on the way, you fall until the last clipping port point and then some more. So that's a bit more dangerous here, but Yeah not the site. But also it keeps you focus the the meditation part. If you know that it's safe you're prob... You're you're not going to divert yourself most probably, but still there some meters falling. So Yeah. He helps to focus definitely.

Host 1: Yeah. Takes like, major expertise.

Client 2: Sorry?

Host 1: Takes, like, major expertise.

Client 2: Bing gone. Like, it depends what you choose. If you just something that's on the on your limit of scale. Then you have to be okay with... There's a big chance falling. But if it's something that you know you can do. And if every route has has a great on it. And the grading system is pretty good. So if I know I can climb six on my limit. And if I go for a five then chance falling curve, just original.

Host 1: I read this author third he's pretty good. He's a pretty good author, but he obviously is a rock climber himself, he always puts himself in the book, and he's like, it's like this little hobby for his, like, main characters like Rock climber, but obviously, he himself is like Climber. She it's pretty good. It's the it's only author I've ever read that has done that. I if you've heard of Tim Tim T, No.

Host 1: Yeah. He's like, a spy novel, but tons of rock climbing in it.

Client 3: Tim T, Yeah.

Host 1: Tim T. He's kind of like an indie author, but he wrote, like, the price of time and the liza spies, I think I think they're pretty good bugs. But he's always, like, you know, rock climbing for something or putting it into the books somehow.

Client 2: If he climber then it's a realistic climbing, not like in some movies. For example, impossible. I think it was a part two the outrageous time can start.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. So that's not real.

Client 2: No.

Host 1: Yeah. This is nothing like that. I don't think.

Client 3: Yeah. The first picture that comes up when you googled him is a picture of him brought company.

Host 1: Oh, really?

Client 3: Yeah.

Host 1: Oh, that's so interesting. Yeah. He's obviously ent Worth the read if you if in the books, we're definitely the read.

Client 3: Yeah. I need back get back into reading. Before I bought the house as like, very good about reading and working out. And then I bought the house and, like, every thing just kind of fell out of fill out of my routine, but now I'm, like, getting back into it.

Client 2: Do do Audiobooks give or just I usually don't do audiobooks books If thought...

Host 1: If I do like, Audio books it's like, a blink for fifteen minutes while I'm on, like, the tread but that's it. Mh. Otherwise, I'm not a fan of audio.

Client 2: No. I'm I'm a huge fan. That pretty too much only way I rate right now.

Host 1: You Yeah.

Client 2: Like wait.

Host 1: But when you do it, like, when you're when you're at own. Like, typically I think a lot of people listen to audiobooks books when they're driving.

Client 2: Right? Yeah. Thanks for. I'm have to do much driving.

Client 2: I mean A few times I've listened just like that as if I would be reading just sit on the the and listen. But it's strange. I I want to do something extra her So alongside some Like, doing the the longer and things like that. It's it's perfect or just walking somewhere. So but after four day on the computer screen, I feel tired to to wait send... The listening helps lot with that.

Client 3: Mh.

Client 2: Yeah and and also in the public transport it's calculated the proper book.

Client 3: Mh. Yeah.

Client 2: But that for some people have problems focusing if they're a book and not something condensed like I think I need...

Host 1: I need something in my hands. So it's like, of doing something I know I just haven't tried audio tons.

Host 1: So maybe maybe something that would work, but like having something in my hands, you know Yeah.

Client 3: Me too. I think. Yeah. I do it Ken. I like my kindle I'm traveling.

Client 2: I think the can switch simultaneously between audio book and and hit and then sync the progress. Never tried it. But if you after that if you're using What was the audiobook book service code?

Host 1: One they were audio this from.

Client 2: I'll. Black if you're using that i, they can see the progress.

Host 1: Sure.

Client 3: Oh, that's really interesting.

Host 1: Can you try blink?

Client 2: I think I did once, but don't have many memories from it.

Host 1: I was I was pretty skeptical, but it... It's alright. I mean, it's fifteen minutes summaries, most save non fiction book, so it's not you do fiction versus not fiction, but it it's alright. Like it's pretty subjective. You know what I mean? Because they're taking these these summaries at the reading in the room, but I think it's alright. We're also what they're trying. If you like audio bugs, because I think it's only audio.

Client 2: I've tried doing the summary on my on my own. And find super helpful for non fiction. Written on fiction book and then I want to make a summary of the highlights. And usually, I don't remember everything so I take any done summary, but then transform it to with the points that actually remembered it and and, like, And before doing that, I found that I don't remember most of the non fiction advice self help or whatever the book was about. But with the sum civilization, I absorb more. Of it Yeah. Yes. Same. I'll have to go. I have a meeting quick look to get some of his time before he leaves good Good luck with it.

Client 3: Good see you guys. Have a good Friday and have a good weekend.

Host 1: Yeah.
