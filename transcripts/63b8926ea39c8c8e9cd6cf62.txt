Host 1: So then, hey, sorry about the... Yeah, the missed call. I following that for thanks for scheduling them.

Client 2: No worries. You jumped on it pretty quickly and had the time. So I'm happy for us to chat.

Host 1: Cool.

Client 2: You you're around now your week nicely?

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, first week of January, you know, glad that's coming to a close Yeah.

Client 2: Everyone's got a pay... A whole book of call me in January that we gotta get around to exactly exactly.

Client 2: Alright. Well, then in that case, you wanna jump right into it I'll sort of finish out your week after this?

Host 1: Yeah. Let's do it. Looking forward to Looking forward to seeing we think Yeah.

Client 2: So look, I got thirty minutes on the calendar. Is that still good for you? Yep. And you can see me fine because I'm gonna be sharing my screen.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Alright. So look, you took the assessment We'll jump right into that. Second. Before we jump into that, though, were there any questions that even you were curious about that you want to make sure we specifically chat it on today.

Host 1: No.

Client 2: Now... Okay. So then what we'll do is we'll jump over. We'll go through the results of that. One thing to keep in mind, while there is no wrong and right answer, there is a best answer and, you know, at least optimal answer. And what these scores are based off of is we work with thousands and salespeople different industries, different companies different verticals. When we found a sort of a benchmark across nine core competence everything from closing to prospecting to posture even accountability and ownership with how we run our sales cycles.

Client 2: Mh. As we go through those, I'll show you how you scored it as well as some of the answers are you okay with me asking you some questions around that just so we can gain some context?

Host 1: Yeah. Let's let's do what whatever you need. Are you gonna provide, like, like a report as well. Do you to provide that? Or you just talk through this. Like, what what's what's typical here?

Client 2: Yeah. I'm gonna share my screen with you and show you the report, and then I can send it over to you if you'd like a Copy.

Host 1: Yeah. Cool. Yeah would be great.

Client 2: Alright. And coming out of today. Typically, you'll have a pretty good idea of this is something you wanna look at a little bit further. If so, we could talk about those options are. And if not, I can always just give you recommendations of maybe some literature you can look at are things you could do on your own. If that's the path you wanna go. So Let's dive on in then.

Host 1: Let's do it.

Client 2: Alright. So I pull my screen, average for what we see in the industry is about a six And you're you were pushing and even above sixty on the number if things.

Client 2: We start looking into a really good and even excellent. Those are scores like seventy seventy five. So we're looking around standard on a number of.

Host 1: So I'm typically below average from what you're seeing. That is insane.

Client 2: On a on a number of these, yes, not on everything. Now when we had spoken before, you mentioned that closing was one of the biggest things you were looking at in proving. You had mentioned about a and ten... Or a hundred and twenty opportunities a quarter coming in what percentage of those closing.

Host 1: I was just looking at the numbers here. Can you I ask that question again?

Client 2: Oh, yeah. You want you wanna take a second to sort of read through this and see what it is that that we're looking at here.

Host 1: So prospecting, closing, qualifying and they're out of a hundred. Right? So basically, I got half of them as not answering ideal or what does this score tell you?

Client 2: Yeah. I wouldn't say Out of a hundred. Like I said, great is generally someone scoring a seventy five. Average for what we see across the industry is usually to sixty. So I would think of great as being seventy five, not out of a hundred.

Host 1: But that seventy five is out of a hundred percent Yeah.

Client 2: In terms of if you got the best answer on every single question in that category.

Host 1: And so this this definition is the ideal.

Client 2: This is just what we're looking at. The definition isn't ideal it's just prospecting.

Client 2: Okay. How well you how nations you are in uncovering and and fueling conversations queuing things up, what your posture looks like, how you present yourself how your... How you're positioning information or how you perceive, you should be presenting yourself it's just this is the the the rubric of what we're measuring. And those seventy questions that you answered Different answers were weighted. Those weights are what fuel into these scores up here.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Yeah. When we had chatted last, you had said closing was the biggest thing you were working towards? Do you mentioned about a hundred and hundred and twenty opportunities coming in in a quarter, that one percentage of those are closing right now.

Host 1: Ten percent ten percent.

Client 2: What's what does the revenue goal look like for the quarter?

Host 1: What you mean what are we looking at top line?

Client 2: Yeah. What what is it that you're trying? What's the number that you're trying to hit in terms of revenue for the quarter.

Host 1: Two hundred two hundred.

Client 2: So ten k ten k deal ten percent of one twenty about twelve. So we're we're leave we're we're about eight deals away from where we wanna be each quarter. Does that sound accurate?

Host 1: So we were about fifty percent in q four So we're pretty far away from two hundred Okay.

Client 2: And were those deals where or is ten k the standard price or does it go up a little down a little It goes...

Host 1: It goes... It goes up and down.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. So What's the plan then moving into q one to raise that ten percent win rate either up to twenty percent win rate or get more deals more opportunities coming in the door. That the ten percent gets us to our number.

Host 1: Yeah. It's a good question. Probably a bit more targeted. And but we get a lot of business from inbound. Right? So I mean, if I can nudge it up with outbound, you know, that'd be a big win. So targeted outbound that for to book more deals. I booked more deals, I closed more business. That's just the bottom line.

Client 2: That's just math. Yeah. I agree with you there. So you would also mentioned with prospecting looking to refine those refine those outbound motions a little bit more. The sequences you were sending out That what percent of the of those meetings booked were un We're prospecting, it depends on industry So we do three segments Like, we do Vcs, we do el learning then we like, general Saas and you is obviously, we're we're fishing around a bit.

Host 1: There's not like a clear key buyer persona. Like, that the excuse our numbers a bit but the interest level is there So, I mean, it depends on segment.

Host 1: Okay. So your question was how much Basically, how much time are we wasting on how bound to people that are now ideal buyers. Was that basically your question?

Client 2: No. No. Not wasting at the time. Of the hundred and twenty deals coming in, what percentage them? Couldn't be a deal anyway because the just not the folks we wanna sell to.

Host 1: Because you said, more deals coming in more qualified meetings happening.

Client 2: The math just works out we get more sales within our key key demographics in our. So I'm trying to figure out how much of that is really working against us here.

Host 1: Yeah. Trying to say, I mean, I think I think probably eighty percent maybe more of the people that I'm talking to are like, a good champion or a Dm or they're gonna move it up to Dm. So I don't think the people I'm talking to... You know, it's maybe a handful of people per quarter I'm talking to that are not a good buyer.

Client 2: Okay. So we're not concerned that our targeting is all we're concerned about getting more people within that target.

Host 1: Inbound is great. That's probably why most of my calls are are really good. In when And book in a meeting I'm getting people. So when I say targeting Due to the people that come through email that convert I'm actually having a conversation with our her fine. I'm having a good conversation. I'm moving to a dm probably gonna be in a position to to close these or not. If falls through it's not because of the key buyers for some other reason, And so my my worry on the the percentage I'm converting to a booked call. Like, el have to reach out to a lot more people to get the same amount of interest then let's say, like a a Sas or a Vc. So you know, when I say targeting, I wanna send less emails to get more booked meetings.

Client 2: Okay. And what percentage of your business is coming from that el learning vertical?

Host 1: We have maybe ten percent of the pipeline, fifteen percent of the pipeline that is from e learning.

Client 2: Okay. Help me understand. If if the el learning is the most effort to get a meeting booked and a small percentage of our pipeline relatively you know, what's leading what's leading us to then? Want to hammer or so hard into that vertical.

Host 1: I want I wanted some work. I guess, more than anything else. I have some in interest, like, the deal size is nice. Like, the interest I do have on deal size is good, although it's really tough to close. Right. So they're probably more enterprise know on Vcs really tight budgets. We have a lot of Vc business. Really tight budget is typically a lower deal size, so I wanna get away from Vc even though, like, the velocity is there, and I'm hoping e learning is gonna be good to replace it. Although it's been... It's it's brand new. So I think is taken about to go the pipeline. So Yeah. That's the main question. But then you go, like, to Sas specialized networking, obviously, most of our revenue comes from there and, like, good deal flow comes. Like, if I was to optimize everything, I would I would double down on on Sas. I just want you learning to work. Right? It it's one segment I want to work. But I wanna turn off Vc because it's just not it's not gonna be significant for us to raise a series.

Client 2: So what I'm hearing is Sas is your core. And if we can refine how we reach out to these el learning folks, they're gonna be bigger deals and potentially more lucrative than Vc altogether.

Host 1: Exactly. I can never increase deal size in a vc. If I'm lucky I make it a Vc at fifteen at ten fifteen k, but, like, it's it's less than one percent that I'm getting that deal size so, like, the potential earnings or just like a flat line? Whereas, like, el learning deal size is way higher potential. I just, like, we're brand new and determining is our product to really get fit for. We're probably early because like, all the conversations I'm having, we can build this for you. We can build this for you. So that's why this sales cycle is longer I won't explore that as a segment for product market fit. We have it for Sas. We have it for Vc c, but you know, the growth potential isn't there is what I'm hoping to learning is. So sam We just gotta... We just gotta be more target and make sure I get more meetings for Sas.

Client 2: Okay. I appreciate this. This provides a lot of context around what we're seeing here. Because oftentimes when folks are exploring new markets That does negatively impact prospecting sales cycle management and closing because you're figuring out who you're prospecting how you're prospecting them. And what that top of follow conversation should look like. As we enter new markets, we're still experimenting and exploring how we manage that sales cycle, how long that sales cycle should be what folks we need to pull into that sales cycle. And then when it comes to closing, it's not until those first two have had a lot of attention that we're seeing a lot of deals start to get to and then cross that finish line. Some of these things are still being defined. What I did is I pulled out some of the answers that you gave. And I was looking for some context to understand where your mind at. Is that around these things? And why? So When we talk about demos, it wasn't the worst answer by any means and demos usually are necessary to close the deal. The optimal answer is demos exclusively relating to the pain that someone's feeling instead of showing them the ten cent tour everything we've got. Is it safe to say that at this point, you are familiar with all the pains that these e learning folks are feelings you could target a demo more specifically. After a short conversation.

Host 1: I mean, it's it's very difficult at this point. But if the the number of conversations that we because we just started conversations in q four. In December, you know, for few meetings. So it's a very it's a very short time period. No. We're not we're not all the way there on on pains for el learning. A little bit, but even when I do outbound, you know, Vcs and Saas. I can I can put stuff up on like, okay. I know these are pains I'm more like get a book a meeting el learning is like, I could be a complete miss. So that that is that's that's tough. Yeah.

Client 2: So we're still looking for those hot buttons. So that we can make these demos and presentations far more focused.

Host 1: I know that a demo has relate to the pain that that's that's really obvious. Like, you have to uncover pain and discovery and present demo that solves that solves the pains of some way. I I think that's that's so obvious. I figured there's no way can close the deal with without. Presenting a demo. Right? I mean, that... That's just the more... The more demos I do the more deals get closed. Like, I can never I can never close deal without doing a demo. It's just very It's never happened before.

Host 1: Sure. I just feel like I was going beyond the pain scenario That's part of why we have this conversation by the way.

Client 2: The numbers are starting point for a conversation. It's not for me to look at them and say, oh, you're great. You suck. I I like to hear what someone was thinking as we go through this because that adds context to these things. So When we mentioned, we're still exploring what the pains might be for these e learning peoples that we don't you know, miss at the top of the funnel... Like you said, those issues you're not having. With the other two segments Here we have the that the questions are friendly and exploring What we often see out of folks that are able to find pain is ras a lot of very targeted short targeted questions so that our prospects can open up about what their pain is. When we're running demos and discovery for el learning How much does the questioning line change from person to person?

Host 1: Very very rarely. So I mean, I Not often. I gonna depends if I have a Dm in the line. If there's a Dm on the line versus champion, I'm gonna ask, like, half the questions. Because I should already have some that information.

Client 2: Ask last questions for Dm denver Champion.

Host 1: Yeah. So the So with the champion I'm probably asking, like, ten, to eleven questions with the Dm I'm recap than asking, like, four open ended questions, then dive mean into to demo And I'm doing that based on gong data So gong does reports and so I kind of model that off of, like, what they say third high performers actually closed deals on And Gong saying that high performers are asking last questions of decision makers?

Host 1: Yeah. They're saying they're saying, like, eleven does exactly what I said this thing. Eleven to fourteen actually for for first meetings on champions and then maybe four Top eight open ended for for Dms, and they say based on their data for calls, those ones closed more.

Client 2: Are you concerned that especially in markets that you're exploring? Not asking more questions could prevent you from finding critical information that could not only affect the deal in front of you, but future deals as well.

Host 1: Yes. I feel about this time we get the Dm and if I ask him a few more questions. I should have a lot of that information from a champion. Probably more so with el learning. It's it's less likely for sure.

Client 2: Okay. So specifically one more one we're uncovering pain asking questions to move into Dms. What we do here is we we Because we said we're not asking as many questions for the demo of the dm. We do is we work heavily on active learning and what we call pain scans. Where it's not questions that we should already know, but ways of finding a additional pain that our champion may not have found before reaching the Dm and what that does is it allows the Dm to express what their priorities and their concerns are as it might relate to their higher level of business so that we as the salesperson can then tailor our presentation, not only to what the champion wanted to see to get us to this point. But also to what the Dm is looking for so that we have everybody on that meeting engaged, and we don't run the risk of missing something critical an assumption. The fatal flaw of a lot of folks that we see is not that they didn't have What the Dm was looking for? That the Dm didn't know they had it because they didn't ask the questions to find out what it was, and they just didn't show it.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying Would you say you wanna ask more questions on a Dm? It sounds like more questions in a Dm Yeah.

Client 2: And that's why you'll see the language here is very specific It's says many concise. They're really tight questions so that we're not leading the Dm to specific answers. We're allowing the Dm to say what's truly important to them. And then we use different listening techniques. Is a whole section in the training. To help them to help coax out the information we need. Without guiding the direction it goes into.

Host 1: K.

Client 2: Nothing thing is it says here whatever prospect asks for a discount, I usually give it to them. Is there a particular reason for that?

Host 1: I'm just thinking, like, every time someone asked for a discount, Let me try to think of the time I didn't give it to him. I mean, when they say when they say budget, I typically don't budge on it. Because it's a budget issue, but when they say you know, can we go down to this number I don't I don't always give them, like, the number that they want. I'm like, alright. Let me see what I what I can do. I'm typically doing something to get them across the line so More often than not, I give them some kind of discount.

Client 2: Okay. When you're getting a discount, are you asking for something else in return from them that they...

Host 1: Sure. Sure. I'm like, hey, I can do this for you, but like, I need a signature this week. Like, I mean, I... I'm I'm asking for something in return.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. How often have you been able to leverage this for things like referrals reviews, online ratings, things of that nature.

Host 1: Online rating what would they get like g two review ratings, things like that?

Host 1: So I would say Sure I can give you a discount, but, you know, if you have a really good experience in this first month, can you give us a good rating on on g two?

Client 2: Yeah. You know, could you... Could you introduce someone else and make sure you give us a rating tell us specifically what you like. Post about this and a community forum that you're in things of that nature.

Host 1: Sure. Yeah. I mean, that there could be something else that I I use, I like, that's Since that's gonna happen, like, outside of thirty days. I definitely haven't thought about that. Usually, it's sort it's something like, hey. I can give you a discount. But if this goes really well, we wanna be able to have like, a case setting user assets to to share with other people. Maybe that concludes tapping into the network, so, yeah, we have done that Okay.

Client 2: So listen. I wanna highlight some things also. Don't want you to feel like I'm just beating you up here so that you you know, so that you want training I mean, it's good.

Host 1: No. It's good know, like, you know, what the typical is compared to and like, reviewing what I put... It's always gonna have and thoughts on it, you know yeah.

Client 2: And and you have really... You have good answers in here well. I don't want you to think because during wrong, we get these from organizations where our team highest score is like a sixty two in the average is like forty thirty. And these are fortune five thousand companies folks with fifteen thirty million series a's that just came in. I mean these are not bad scores by any means. It seems like you're doing about fifty percent of the talking in the demos, that's good. Anything more than fifty percent we see as a problem, but it sounds like you're leveraging Gong, to make sure that your talk time is around that I used to use Gong.

Host 1: We use what is called sales Ai at this point, and they'll give us percentage.

Client 2: But it still gives you those numbers.

Host 1: Still gives us that number.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. And I also had down here Folks are leaving saying that they learned a lot why do you think it is that that your answer wasn't Afterwards, they view the product as a direct solution to a problem.

Host 1: Yeah. I answered that way because I think that's actually a problem. So a lot a lot of times I say, hey, I learned a lot this was something that that's good for me to take back to my team. Don't like that answer. I know it's the wrong one. So I think I I wanna reduce them telling me that they learned a lot, and instead you know, I've had all these answers actually, None of them actually said this solves a problem.

Client 2: Okay. Now we we talked a little bit earlier about, you know, we look for pain and things like that. How much of your language early in the demo is around pains that you're solving as opposed to benefits of features of the product.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, it's gotta be bit of both. Right? I mean, it's always the latter. But you know, if I uncover pains or when I uncover pains, then I can use our our product has solution which is also benefit selling. It's not... I'm not I'm not selling features. That's not what I'm selling in the demo.

Host 1: Good. Good good. Yeah. It's... It's more like when I give this demo, how well can I link it back to the pains that I uncover in Disco?

Client 2: So this it safe to say that the more pain we can find the more we can make it back and the more valuable we could position our product to today.

Host 1: Yeah. Hundred percent.

Client 2: Okay. So look, just out of time saying, you know, I'll send you this. You can see we we picked a snippet of questions that encompass your answers across the board. Does it make some sense for me to sort of share one of two routes we could go from here.

Host 1: Yeah. And when you share this So these was that you picked out are answers that you find basically concerning versus they're not the ideal answer.

Client 2: No. Not necessarily concerning. Just things that are import that I wanted to get your in your input on and gain more context around what you chose those answers?

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. There's two ways we can go here. One of which is if you're a person who says, look, I like to study and learn and do these things on my own. Could send you over a we've written... Eight sales books, a copy of triangle selling, it's our our sales methodology. They could go over to create commitments, how to find pain, how to prospect to develop your Ic and understand which personas especially in companies like el learning, where there's lots of folks who do we target? What message do we target them with and how we include the appropriate people you could do all that on your own another option is the winter circle program we talked about before. Because you mentioned you're you're targeting new Ic, one of the main sessions of that. Is Where is it? Where is it? Is no that buyer. So what we do here is we understand our competitive landscape where we win where our competitors win who we need to talk to, what are the different attributes of a key market? And what this is gonna do is make it that your messaging is relevant. To all the people that need to hear that messaging within an organization, so that we're not hit or missing. But we're at least landing to some degree with our outbound and with any direct outreach that we add in.

Client 2: As it relates to closing and finding that pain. So that you can close more specifically reasons that compel finding pain, there's a whole framework within the methodology around defining how we find pain looking for that pain asking the right questions, and then using active listening to get that info without someone feeling like they're being interrogated like we're being a s salesperson. It's all about organically finding that pain. And concise asking the questions to get that information. What are your thoughts, you know, and feel free to take a look This is the curriculum for a quarter. The curriculum are similar each quarter, but we go in detail about different areas of the sales process.

Host 1: I mean, when does this program start? Is is it like a cohort, basically, wherever everyone starts in the same date, No.

Client 2: It's ongoing. So if you were to start week three of q one, you would go all the way three and then up to week three of q two.

Host 1: I see. So you'll you'll get forever and come in.

Host 1: I I come in where you're at currently.

Client 2: Yeah. You get all the topics. Most now it's a little different each quarter, we we focus on different nuances we go deeper on certain pieces, but you're gonna get the same general pieces during each quarter. Most folks do one or two quarters at a time. Some folks stick around for about a year or so.

Host 1: Yeah. I think... I think these topics are are valuable and how long is this an hour every single week?

Client 2: Hour and a half we're done with the first forty five minutes for teaching these concepts. And then we saved the second forty five and we'll play in practice second forty five minutes is for live coaching, specific deals, specific things you ran into during the week, And like I told you, Yeah.

Client 2: As long as you don't tell other people in the room, I'm happy to book time separately. To do some of that one on one coaching that you said you were looking for.

Host 1: Okay. How many people join mastermind how many people are actually in there during that session.

Client 2: Fluctuates. I have some glasses where there's twenty people in the room. Some classes where there's three people in the room. The beauty of you having this schedule as you can pick in choose which sessions are most valuable to you.

Host 1: I see Oh, I forgot something.

Client 2: With this, you also get access to close Loop University it's our online learning academy, you're in learning, you know what that looks like. It's our online academy that covers all of these topics Not at a one zero one level, but a one zero three or one zero four level. So that when you enter these sessions, we can go deep two zero three, three zero three as opposed to keeping it base level. So we can work on advanced topics here. You have closed loop university for life.

Host 1: Okay. I mean, I think think it's valuable the way that you set it up with forty five minutes training them forty five minutes like specific coaching, and probably hear chat with other people. Is there a Slack group or anything that we're all thrown in as well or anything like that?

Client 2: Not a bad idea. I might make one of those.

Host 1: Might it might be kinda cool for, like, cohorts or something. Yeah. My my only concern is, like, I'm totally up for some like this. This is something I'm I'm looking for like, I'm I'm looking into, like, medic, and I'm looking into, like, spin selling. I'm looking into Like, Gong, their former head of sales has a pretty nice course out there. Isn't, like two hundred bucks but it doesn't have, like, the ass and there's a Slack group put that, but there isn't, like, an aspect of coaching anything like that. So this is I wanna take advantage of I'm feeling that I need a couple deals to land in January If you like to good momentum before I dive into something like this, but I... Especially, Like at at the price point it is, like, whereas, like, two bucks for like, Gong Chorus, like, it... It's kind of a no brainer, but I need some good momentum. In January to... I mean, that's just where I'm at right now. And once I have that, I I think this is like, top of the list, you know?

Client 2: So what I'm understanding is you wanna close a couple deals to get the cash something like this. Then dive into it.

Host 1: I kinda feel more confident that... Yeah, that I have momentum in January into q one, deal flow is is increasing back up again like it was in q four. Yeah. I I think that's that's part of our. Yeah.

Client 2: Let me ask you this then. What's a budget you would be... You would be comfortable with either now or in the next week or so provided you felt it was it was worth the value.

Host 1: Yeah. That's really tough. Is say the budget I would feel confident in I don't wanna love volume. So I I I don't like that answer. Because I I don't know if you're like the answer, but something that that works So you do five k every six months. Right?

Client 2: Five every six months. Or three k for a quarter. And it doesn't have to be all front, we could we can do monthly.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe month would be helpful, So what would that be so I it grand month little bit less.

Host 1: Little bit less than a grand a month. If it like a scaling at this point, like, if we're like in the mid q one deal flow is solid. I don't think that'd be an issue. Maybe there's like a scaling mechanism where we do like you know, start at five per month, and then we increase it. So you do get your two point five three k per month when it comes down to it. Who's sorry for court... Yeah. Per month, That's what I'm thinking.

Client 2: So just wanna make sure I understand. It would for example, instead of, like, Eight hundred eight hundred eight hundred eight hundred. It would go five five five twelve twelve, twelve. What whatever that ends up being, so that it reaches six grand, but it starts off cheaper and then scales upward.

Host 1: It'd be more like five eight twelve and then you know, twelve from there.

Client 2: If I could swing that, would you be in? I truthfully don't know. This is not a sales play. I'd have to ask, that's that's above my... I set the price for this. I don't do the billing so I got... I don't wanna piss off the person doing billing. But I could certainly ask for this.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, yeah. Just, like, you you said, like, If if that's something that you could do... You able to like, get started. Where are you in week one right now then?

Client 2: We too is Week one just happened. Week two is next. So next week, we'll be doing the defined I got an idea for you I'll ask. Do we do this? Why don't you just show up to week too? You and I can work specifically on seeing if we can gain some momentum for that el learning segment. Setting out that Ic p, creating some some winning zones wizards really. Let's see if we can make some headway there. I'll put my my money where my mouth is. See if I can provide you some value. And then out of that once that session is over, and I just hang around for twenty minutes and discuss what we wanna do next. That fair I think so.

Host 1: What what exactly happens in this this sweet tooth was forty five minutes, and it's just like a presentation you have and, like, Ic p's and personas as it means for outbound resumes to close, as a means to define who you're reaching out to how you're creating messaging how we speak to different personas.

Client 2: How can we define everyone we need within an Ic so we can prospect effectively.

Host 1: Yeah. I'm trying to think I'm trying to... I know we're at I time.

Client 2: Got a few extra minutes, but just if you wanna take... That would be one thirty eastern time, to three Pm. Eastern time online day?

Client 2: Tuesday at the tenth.

Host 1: Tuesday, I have I have a couple meetings I've I've been meeting it to Let me let me think if the So, like, I I think I'm at a point where gosh. Let me let me think. I think I think it's... I think it's compelling. I think like, I'm almost there for it. And you're, like, gather my thoughts, I guess. Would be great to have someone to talk to on this stuff since this is exactly what I'm working on.

Host 1: I just have a I just have I have I a meeting in that time.

Client 2: Yeah. When you say someone to talk to Are you asking for a reference?

Host 1: No. No. I mean, I think I have like a plan. Like, I'm fine with Buyer personas you know, I think I need to tweak to get conversions. Right? Like, I can grab key buyer personas. It's like, I I know exactly who we're going after. The messaging I need to to craft to get them to book more meetings, that's where I'm asking is like, walking out the things that I already know. And then once I have people in the pipeline, how do I, you know, increase that pipeline and get more business in deal size? So that's basically where meant at this point.

Client 2: These two sessions, the reason these two sessions are back to back is because that's what is defined to do. Go deeper on what it is that we know, but how we can go a little deeper on it and then use that information for that week three. To craft that messaging, create compelling pain statements so that we're not just selling with benefits we're selling with removing pain and the benefits of doing so.

Host 1: Mh Okay.

Client 2: Well, look, I'm not here to rush. I understand these these can be, you know, big decisions there is one other option. Do you have two, three minutes, I could share what that is and I'll leave you with it. We can regroup another time.

Host 1: I do. I do you got.

Client 2: We have a condensed version of this. It's called jump start. It doesn't go as deep on each and every one of these topics. But it covers everything here one month period. So it's three three hour courses, the first second and third, Thursday of every month We essentially go boom boom in those three courses, and you still get closed loop university with that. What some folks will do, I actually have a a Ceo in the Jump program right now. He's doing the he's doing jump start and then going into winter circle. So he gets a really strong understanding of the methodology and all the knowledge involved. Then we can use winter circle over the next quarter or two. To deeply reinforce and coach that information. Comes in at fifteen hundred bucks. That I can't break up into a payment plan. It's also a significantly lower price point.

Host 1: Mh. Mh. Well, it'd be it'd be fifteen for the month of the quarter.

Client 2: Fifteen for the month for the jump start program. The program is a three week program.

Client 2: Okay. But you also get closed loop university included in that which is twelve hundred bucks on its own and you have that for life, Okay.

Host 1: Would you be able to send over, like, like, any more in on on the assessment that you gave over, like, what was typical there for you.

Client 2: What do you mean?

Host 1: What's typical? Like like, this gives, like, like my overall score, but I'm curious, like, on the questions I answered plus, like, what's what's typical. Like, what's the ideal answer?

Client 2: The idea... So the the the least ideals that top answer ideals the bottom answer. I can send this over we picked out about, you know, ten, fifteen questions that we want to ask about and gain some more context you gave me a lot of great context around them. Like I said, by no means is this, like, a a horribly leak concerning score? This tells us you have a really strong your foundational mindset and how you approach sales is really strong. Now we need to refine there's opportunity to refine some of the specific selling skills and techniques that are gonna directly impact those numbers. Move that ten percent up to fifteen percent twenty percent and less on qualified leads coming through and ultimately get closer to that two hundred k a quarter revenue goal.

Host 1: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think I just this is really good to have like I wanna get... I like I wanna get deal flow coming in and this like, okay. You know, by pipelines builds I got a lot of... Like, the conversation need to back from January. It's gonna happen, but I think once the starts happening is, like deals start coming in like, Alright. Now. How do I tweak what already doing to to get the point where I want to. You know, I just Yeah.

Host 1: January.

Client 2: Can I ask one more question and then we'll we'll we'll break for today. Yeah. If deal flow doesn't pick up with what you're doing today, what are you gonna... What's gonna happen at that point, that's gonna need to be tweaked to make deal flow pickup up and to be able to prospect more effectively.

Host 1: I mean, what I was doing last quarter brought in good deals, so some expecting I'm expecting to at least do that that well if it doesn't something it's probably wrong with our inbound. Something's happened with with our inbound. So I'm not I'm not looking to learn how to bring in deal flow. Learned how to have a process that can get us a hundred k for a quarter. Right. I'm looking I'm looking to, like, what can I do differently? That'll two or three x or Arr on a quarterly basis. So know your flow is gonna come in once it starts getting there, team will start feeling better about budgets and everything else. The court will start kicking off and then, like, okay. Now I'm in a place where I can, like, stop struggling of my first couple deals. Like, deals already come in in January. Once I get some more then... Okay. Let's focus on scaling instead of let's get our first deals in doing. It's more like a mindset scenario.

Client 2: Yeah. The only reason I asked about that is there's a lot of concerning the industry right now that organic deal flow isn't gonna be in short supply and what's gonna drive a lot revenue for a lot of companies is leveraging their existing clients or existing happy clients for referrals for upsell for cross sells for partnerships, So folks that are relying heavily on the deal flow that they used in q four. Might be in for for turbulence guys. I don't know your business in... I'm not trying to, you know, fear tactics and say that's the case. There's just a lot of the talk that's been around lately.

Host 1: Because the economy...

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, eighteen thousand jobs from Amazon ten to seven eight k from Salesforce Well was it vimeo Yeah. It's a... I think even Mcdonald's is getting ready to start cutting now, I saw a report today.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Do you feel like there's always, like, a certain percentage of the of the economy that has buyers ready Right? There still are people like hiring at this point as well.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, personal opinion, when there's a boom, I think that's when marketing thrive and inbound thrive right? Because people have access but people have budgets they need to spend. And their are telling them to go and actively seek out new tools to optimize things. Then when when when the economy constrict, those same folks say, hey, how do we trim the fat on our current operations so that we can weather the storm until we're really good again. So you know, it's a balancing act of going out and getting new stuff and then getting rid of stuff we're not using.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. I gotta tell you The mastermind idea is is rates. Maybe maybe my my hesitation is on the structure. Like, if I'm gonna talk about key buyer personas I'm gonna talk about messaging is always important. I can always, like, improve that. I don't wanna go through like, a structure program where maybe I know most of it and the biggest value is having discussions on that which you are doing, which is like, what a great mastermind is about. Yeah. That... That's why initially when I ask, like, are you doing sales calls? Like one offs stuff like that. Because if I can talk about specific things that are happening rather than like a structured program that's probably maybe part of where my hesitation is coming from.

Client 2: Okay. Look guys that. And I'm happy to put this in writing for you. If there's you know, we do one forty five minute, one zero one call week out side of this. I'm happy to give you a guarantee for something like that. For one on one coaching. That's also why I think it would be beneficial for you to attend the class. I know you're busy next week. I think it might go a little deeper on presume in messaging and how we approach that, then what you might be acting because we're not teaching one on one level stuff. Right? I'm not looking for Sdr. Or first time sellers that are looking to move up to an ae or get their feet wet I'm looking for... We're we're taking folks that have strong understanding or business owners themselves and going really deep on these sales skills.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Look, we we've taken a lot of time. I'm not a big pressure you say yes, type guy. Do you mind if I ask what it is that that you wanna go and figure out other than, you know, deal flow before we make a decision yes or no on something like this?

Host 1: It's it's budget. Right? Compared to some other things that are out there that I can... I can start on One Yeah. The things I can start them right away, but not cohort based or, like, their their self paste As a ramp up And then it's just it's just like a three month commitment. I think is the biggest thing at this point with some other things out there that are self pace. I mean, Yeah. Budget always concerned.

Client 2: Would your company do something like a fifty fifty split with you on something like this, if they if you thought it be truly valuable, I would I could ask him.

Client 2: Yeah. Do you make... Well, why don't we do that for next steps? Why don't you have a chat with you know, whoever it is that you think needs to. If they wanna come and chat just talk about the same thing you talked about. I'm happy to share it directly. And then if that's the case, that would significantly ease the constraints on budget.

Host 1: Yeah. That would that would be helpful. Yeah. That would be helpful. What do you recommend I I share with him in that case? Anything besides just the conversation ship this is something that that you'd be up for.

Client 2: Here's what I would recommend. Here's well, more important one, here's what I've seen. Folks have success with in the past. Sure. I'll share with you the assessment readout. And the way we look at this is not that you're doing poorly in any of these areas. Because that's simply not the case. A score of forty is poor is that these are the areas where there's the greatest opportunity for growth that's gonna have an immediate impact. Immediately affect how we get to that two hundred k quarter Arr, And then what I'll do is I'll also share with you the winter circle curriculum, and I will highlight in the comments which of those sessions tie directly to the areas for opportunity of growth that we found in the assessment.

Client 2: Sure. That's fine really.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't show the assessment. I mean, I would never share fifty five percent with anyone that I'm working with, just whatever we even though that albert means, I'm not gonna show that with anyone.

Client 2: Understood.

Host 1: The structure is good. The first question that they're gonna ask is who who's in the group? Like, what who else is in there that is doing cool things that you can learn from beyond? Beyond the beyond curriculum. Right? So I I think I'd have to answer it who is in there.

Client 2: Yeah. We've got a number of aes we've got Sdr that are looking to become Aes, some companies, put whole cohorts of folks in there. For example, I one company called source scrub, they work with Vcs just like yourself. Their whole business development team shows up every other week for lessons coaching. I got another guy who runs his own business. He makes he's a media company for other small business owners they can effectively promote themselves So he's having to constantly adjust his selling strategies his mess things like that. Got the whole gamut of folks, but it's mainly Aes and small business owners.

Host 1: Mh. Mh. Okay. Sure. From from Sas mostly from Sas.

Host 1: Most terms and fast. Okay. Let me let me have a recession.

Client 2: Okay. Why don't I write up a bit proposal if you will, that explains the value to benefit some of the key areas and Well, what do you think... I'm sorry. Don't let me. What do you think would be most official. These are your coworkers. What do you think they're gonna wanna see that I could put in writing to help Yeah.

Host 1: I understand just need to have a conversation. Like, we started to have a conversation Let me continue the conversation. And see if that's something... So we're we're pretty series we wanna raise a series a post q one. Obviously, the he's not making anyone happy. You know what I mean especially Vc these, who are people that we have to get a series from. So it's just us, like, every single other company, my series gonna go off here and Why my siri gonna go off?

Client 2: Because you said series.

Host 1: But it's it's causing... It's causing the well, is this what we need to be spending our budget on right now And again, because there's not lot of deal flow coming in, although there are some deals that have happened. Yeah. I don't know. I I think that's just gonna be a cause for concern. So that's what I say it's like, hey. Let's let's increase some deal flow get momentum. Everyone's gonna feel a little bit better about okay. Releasing some budget on some things myself included. I I think conversation is one thing, but sued, you know, things need to happen within the company with sell us having any confidence that a series is gonna happen in Q two.

Client 2: Understood. Understood. So the the next step is the company...

Host 1: I didn't get that. Could you try again?

Client 2: So so this you to have that conversation internally.

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. Should we put some time on the calendar for mid next week so that you can have that conversation and which regroup and see where we move from there.

Host 1: Yeah. If we So I have once one. Some conversations around the week. I have a once one on Thursday, Do you wanna do Thursday?

Client 2: As long as it's after two in the afternoon because I have that jumps I'm doing the jones star training it's all in the morning.

Host 1: Yeah. Totally fine. Whenever we after two works for me.

Client 2: Yeah. Let's do two thirty and What could I get over to you? That would be helpful for you in this conversation?

Host 1: Any more details on on the sessions on the weekly sessions. Like I add the topics, which are great. If you have any additional curriculum that I could take a look at that... That's the only thing I could think that would be helpful for me.

Client 2: I'll send you that. I'll send you a copy of that and I'll also send you a link. We have a whole landing page on winter circle that goes extensively into all the different things we could cover on there. I'll send it over as well.

Host 1: Okay. Great. Yeah. That thanks in.

Client 2: Awesome. I Have a great weekend and I'll look it to Chatting.

Host 1: Appreciate it. You too. Talk to soon then. You.
