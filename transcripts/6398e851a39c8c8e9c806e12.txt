Host 1: Mikey. Great to meet you. How are you doing?

Client 2: I'm doing good. Good to meet.

Host 1: Right To me as well. Where you calling from?

Client 2: I'm in Santa Barbara California normally, but I'm in Cooper g right now.

Host 1: Great. What are you do there?

Client 2: Fiance, Family list up here go here for a couple days and gonna go up to the tahoe area to see that we can.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: I'm just. Yeah. This was pretty cool.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. I I'm I mean miami Florida. I I'm used to francisco and I just moved out here last year.

Client 2: Nice. What brought out there.

Host 1: Texas. Honestly. And I I'm moving back to f As it starts here. Is that good. Yeah.

Client 2: What what do you not like?

Host 1: It's it's just it's a parking lot. It's just a giant talking about. You know? I'm like... I mean, right now, I you won't be able to see but I have, like, crazy view of like on the ocean. They literally just saw a shop on my window. Like a hud hedge clock. Right? And, like, meta so like, that's awesome but get that twenty i'm sixteen day. Right now I need to be in a good city, with tech people bought around me and you I need that stuff.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: So.

Client 2: Yeah. It seems like there's is definitely a little bit of next to to Miami in general, but there's a lot of people come back.

Host 1: There's been a lot boomerang. How do you know you?

Host 1: Oh, You do I don't know him personally.

Client 2: He's one of the one investors in to my knowledge, and then our Ceo basically to account with him and then pointed pointed me in your direction.

Host 1: Okay. Awesome. Alright. Well, thanks not taking the time. I've been really looking forward to this conversation because i I'm not just saying that. Like, you exactly the kind of person that we're looking to get it touch with of thousand items of title in terms of background. It used to be at deal, any tells of the app that you used uc is Or. So Let me you up to speed on the context of this chat. So leo invested in us about two years ago we are pivoting to building sales. Well still caesar. So right now, we have two big but we have three big things on the stove. But really the two biggest one all the data. So like Either? Add a gong competitor.

Host 1: Sure. Like a coaching chain thing, which is the other reason I i'm excited to because I feel like kind of mechanism adjacent field like you're also like a in like, sales coaching and learning and all of that stuff.

Client 2: So Before I go in details, does that make sense of how any any questions about what we do.

Host 1: Do you currently use a dial a like meeting intelligent edge intelligence tool So we use Gong for the eight columns and sales engineers.

Client 2: We use outreach for the Bd r team. And as part of about outreach. They have a dial they have a call recording tool. It's relatively basic. Was a call recording and kinda hard to pull, like insights out of it. It's more of just, like we have granular dispositions. The Bd r can say, we're it's like what happened on the call and I can sort information based on that. that's really all I have right now. I know hour just coming up with some more of more of like a gong competitor. Do. Like, add onto to their stack, but that's what looks like for now.

Client 2: then I usually one moment.

Host 1: I didn't realize that. So Outreach is coming out with a gong company competitor there. Is that public big information?

Client 2: Let me see. The Cs just me today. Right. Share much quick.

Host 1: Yes. Oops Interesting Yeah. I'll three you crazy. It's really turning into like an ultimate salesman bundle long.

Client 2: Yeah. They're trying to do a lot for sure.

Host 1: What do you think of that? Is that is that as a payer? Is that a good i think?

Client 2: Unless you have your whole team on outreach, I don't think it really makes sense. So, like, for us, we use next max for our ae because it's significantly cheaper and our aes don't the time. We don't need to spend a hundred and fifty dollars per month. Per ae for a tool that basically pushes contact activity back to Salesforce and gives them, like basic sequencing. So if you have your whole sales team on it, like sure, you can do forecasting and mutual action plans and maybe, like, some call reporting out of the tool. That definitely makes sense. But first step there is like hey you gotta have everyone on the same tool. I don't think is necessarily the case for a lot of companies. I'll see you how they massive massive bill.

Host 1: Got it. So the reason why you don't only thirty days is really just a price Yes.

Client 2: That was kinda led by my old Cro. And he just didn't want to spend that much money. Raise when they were maybe be creating one opportunity on thor less, like doesn't make sense.

Host 1: Yeah. And love to learning and hear from you like, does that work from your viewpoint? Ahead of sales, right, at we're?

Client 2: Yeah. Leave web ups.

Host 1: So you are in child of buying the whole red.

Client 2: Yes. And relative you the wool. So I've been in super since maybe about February. And then prior to that, I was leading the Sdr work.

Host 1: And then Yes.

Client 2: Now also reports back. Up to me. After we went some some reduction force.

Host 1: Okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear. That's that's fine. But congrats on the on the rise, like I was checking out the team. Like, it's it's a also in three years it went from Seo, so that kind of write offs.

Client 2: Not Sdr. Again as the Sdr manager.

Host 1: Not.

Host 1: Not quite drastic.

Host 1: Yeah. So as... In by way, sorry, like, the the context here is like, I'm looking to learn the the industry. And try in a silly dynamic. Here At all, Like, we'll like looking for Pm and, like, frankly, my objective of this is like we're looking for these design problems. Yeah. I think the pitch is competing for you guys as well. Because you may be able to Like, on the gong bill. Right? Which I understand is cheap. But... Right, what I'm looking for is loading, basically. As a red ups manager as a wrap leader, how much do you feel about spend? Is that the compelling setting points to you?

Client 2: I didn't care about spend beginning of the year. I care about spend now.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah it's it's gonna ugly new market. Okay. How do you care that spend? Are you incentivized any way need like you even do you have your seal and your backups were?

Client 2: Then I'm basically managing most the negotiations for for our tech stock spends and given a rough target for hey. This is our burn right by now. This is what we're trying to or go try and save as much money. That wasn't the dynamic the beginning of the year that is definitely dynamic right now.

Host 1: Yeah. It's a crazy market right now. How are you gonna go about saving money.

Client 2: We consolidated some tools most of it was basically trying to get the money back from vendors when we recently signed a big contract with them for a large Sdr team. Then had a significant risk where we Like, basically, only cap maybe about a quarter of our Sdr team.

Client 2: So most of it was just like hey, we sign this contract. Can you do anything to help get this bill down for us. And then doing some looks like tech stack consolidation. Like, for example, we have zoom info we the data tool. They own forests. We considered potentially switching off Gong and using chorus instead.

Host 1: I'm. Can you repeat that?

Client 2: Yep. So Zoom and built owns, Chorus. Global according tool.

Client 2: Yeah we use An. We toss around the idea of just ditching gong and moving on to Chorus and Zoom info together. But we ended up just not doing that, specifically because Gong was very much loved in the organization. It would been a significant move. We had a pretty good deal with Gong. And the Chorus product wasn't great and their sale process was with pretty horrible.

Host 1: What wasn't great about the correct product?

Client 2: It was hard felt the ae was pretty bad and, like, wouldn't give me a transparent information I'm like, hey, This is what Gong does is what Chorus does. It's why you should switch So I didn't really take honestly tooth too much look at the tool. Ivy use chorus in the back. It worked fine for when I was ae three years ago. But it was gonna be a significant lift. I gotta ton push back in the organization of where it's like, hey, this is the most most loved tool I have, please don't take this out of my hands. Used chorus in the path. I don't wanna use it again. So I didn't wanna have a big target on my back and didn't push hard to get rid of it.

Host 1: Does anything would anything ever had replacing gong for you right now, would you be like this is the secret gap like just loves it too much.

Client 2: Probably wouldn't touch it.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Even even for like, seventy thousand savings.

Client 2: It would be tough. I'd have to have someone else the organization and really driving. That my finance team just saying, hey you have to cut spend. Much more aggressively on it that I am now.

Host 1: Wow. Okay.

Client 2: I think that's unique to our situation here. I don't think that's across the board. We also don't use Gong to both them. Like, we're using pretty basic functionality and I've got an imagine most people are that way too. We use it for call recording, analysis and picking up some general trends. Not using it at as like, a heavy coaching tool giving feedback on calls and, like, typing that information in. Honestly, if we had to get oh, like, start cutting tools, like, we could use we could use Zoom call recording. Get away with that for sure.

Host 1: Okay. but he's very ready in inflammation. I'd love to show you real quick what we can recognize can tell me if that's still you'll start. So it feel still like nah like, gong columbus ready that's where you were based price. Can you Yep.

Client 2: Get This is what we built so about.

Host 1: So the way we're thinking about it is, like, We've done it ton refills and we here what you just told me all the time. It's like people tell like, Gong is just whole Christmas tree kind like thousand features only just use the basic videos. And so we wanna be like a mold focused gong, that's also cheaper and, like, i'll way better their experience. Yep. And so right now, this is what it looks like, but we're we're building it pretty quickly. And so you know, as you can see, I think it's prettier. Right? You know, feels like the same basic details so right now we're working on, like, getting the parity on, like, the insides that trends. Yeah. That is these little that stuff. But very soon, we're also building a thing that leverages Ai such that you can dot to a sort of chatbot get any insights about any meeting or anything. You can be like, hey. What's the status of that deal? What was the biggest objection that is? How do you mean Right? And and all that stuff. So again, the bitch is More Ai on top of it. A simpler better build product cheaper, Like, way cheaper. I think gosh like I did fifty belmont per user? Think we're gonna chose like fifty people multi per user.

Host 1: Yep. Has them be depreciate with you what you think?

Client 2: Yes. I think the interesting part is the cost savings and then the interaction where you can spike, intelligently ask questions based on the transcripts.

Client 2: Those would be the part that interesting. I think this is more interesting thing for, like, an aes case. Str sdr use cases call recording is interesting, but I would never go spend a bunch of money on a tool like Gong. Or my Sdr.

Host 1: When?

Client 2: They don't call enough.

Host 1: What what did they do?

Client 2: Most of... We booked probably about seventy five percent of our meetings through. Cold email.

Host 1: Good. That sounds efficient.

Client 2: No not the most efficient thing in the world, but definitely with a smaller team. We just have more successful email.

Host 1: Interesting.

Client 2: Like so I wouldn't I wouldn't spend list price on gong, a hundred fifty dollars per month. Take get insights for my Sdr team when I can get some basic ones with outreach already.

Host 1: So that's still half of what we're building right now is this is this diagram Yes.

Host 1: Which is it's it's kind of it's very similar to go overall, but again, cheaper I think way deal data we will... Our we we hate it don't me. It's just it's just not a great product. So that's that's how works. It's like you you would have like a desktop avenue, You know, it's it's like a native thing and like, It just it's just join better automatically open linkedin of you're dialing with have like a sales also like, you can be good fly by your manager on the side. I guess if that you'll here.

Client 2: I mean we dial, but it it would be least the mindset that we're right now is we wouldn't be spending additional putting the additional money behind dialing for our team. Like, it's more of a activity push rather than, like, a tech push.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Quick question here for the or competitor. Is this parallel dialing like they do or what are you thinking here?

Host 1: It is... Yes. It would be valid dialing.

Host 1: Okay. What do you think of that?

Client 2: I think it's great when you have a large target addressable market. And a solid connect rate or, like, good day to to call op of. It definitely you need a Bad team that is very good at cold calling to be able to to get some value out of it for sure.

Host 1: Why?

Client 2: It's rapid environments. It's heavy. It's it's challenging.

Host 1: Yeah. Yep.

Client 2: It is just definitely a shift for Sdr if you don't have them already calling like, really aggressively across the board. Say team dialing, like, making Eighty a day, like, having those back to back conversations where you don't certainly have all like your notes tee up and, like, know you're calling exactly. Again, it's more of like a training thing. It's not necessarily a product issue with Rm or ap recognizing.

Host 1: Definitely.

Client 2: That makes sense. Yeah. It's... I mean, you you get a ton i can access awesome. If you have someone like that as on the phones, like they can crash up.

Host 1: Yeah. And like I said, rob we hate the implementation of the product. I think, maybe you because will know that we we can see how much better we could do. But the of the action data, I I would not be able to sell without it anymore. Yeah. Okay. So it sounds like for you that's like Na saying, like, the gong thing is more the same, but With what I showed you, like, are you still in the camp Life this is just not a headache and waiting to take all this like a ups either.

Client 2: Not at the moment, but I think my mindset said is probably a little bit unique here. Then I just... I just dealt with a ton of internal pushback.

Client 2: And then I would say if you are gonna be going after Gong market, definitely like a talk track over, like, how you're gonna import all your data and make sure they don't lose that information insights is really important. That was my biggest concern. And I got really shaky answers from the Course team when I was exploring switching off. And I didn't feel confident that.

Host 1: Interesting.

Client 2: Yes. They basically said, yes. We can do it, but no details around it any anytime there wasn't details.

Client 2: It was like, alright.

Client 2: This was a little sketchy.

Host 1: What's the ideal insult description for you?

Client 2: I wanna be able to import all my calls have all the transcripts eat up. And then if you're treating you're using insights, any way, be able to maintain that data.

Host 1: First inside this transcripts And if I told you, hey, yeah, we'll take bit we have, like, a team of folks philippines that like, will connect to your gong. Tickle data and, like, no there us week or something. like, two days. Is that what what would you think of that?

Client 2: I let's see honestly. Like, I wanna see that process. Like, show me an example of, like, you importing call and what it looks like. In your tool. Like, Chorus team couldn't couldn't show me that. And so I just I just didn't wanna I didn't wanna a mess with ruining running a bunch of our data for the last five years.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: It it was really sketchy.

Host 1: So Go ahead.

Client 2: The class thing team is a little bit interesting because they wouldn't give me a line item on course. Basically, we have this massive of spend was the member right now. And we have, like, great discounts and we definitely have like some sweetheart pricing, but we are only using, like, eight seats of three member right now or paying for like forty five seats. Pretty crazy. It's just because we signed the contract and then two months later went through a rip. And so we had all these just on unused seats. And so we're gonna basically take all of our spend that we have and gong and move it over to Zoom in info, and they we're gonna keep the contract the same. We weren't really necessarily super trans on a pricing aspect on there end saying like, hey, this is portion i'm gonna go towards your data tools as how much go towards Chorus, it was like, hey. Let's just keep the contract the same size. And so saving there is a little bit tough to calculate. But it would been like, We spent about forty k on gong right now. And our contract with even though was bath seventy five. K.

Host 1: Got it. So you would still have saved folding in cave. But it sounds like what kills the deal for you like, the just will good. So it's, like the relationship side of things.

Client 2: Yeah. They have working on it. Just wasn't very transparent was pretty confrontational and it just didn't make me feel good about whole process That makes sense.

Host 1: Yeah jens that covered with, like, a couple couple leaders pinging me saying like, hey, please don't.

Client 2: Please don't rip out gong. So I basically gave it to finance then and said, hey, this is your call. Let me know what you wanna do.

Host 1: Last thing I'd love to run by you. Again, right now super early and like, wrapping the head around print prop. Is this thing we built this called Cell Ai, so you can Let me show you basically you connect all of your stuff just like connect sales. And then this happens to your Aes when they doing any like, demos or anything.

Client 2: Right?

Host 1: Yep. But there is a thing that automatically opens next two colleagues don't need to do anything. It automatically links up to Zoom call to the Crm and the right records the right port community. Can use it to take notes. During the meeting? But then the real interesting thing is like, when it ends the goal, It uses Ai to analyze what was said during the call like you transcribe the meetings And then it automatically updates the crm employee.

Client 2: That's very cool.

Host 1: Is that is that compelling table?

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, that's definitely interesting. Like, you do have bunch of structured data and Salesforce and the opportunity, like being able to all information it's like, very, very interesting.

Host 1: And that's like two today. I I didn't demo it. But like this is what we have today. Like next steps, could build it price list. Like, these are all fields in salesforce. And it's working. And so, basically, that makes sure the channel will back crm hygiene and you'd, like, say saves done identifying the aes.

Client 2: Yeah. That's really cool. That's awesome.

Host 1: Do you have anything like that right now, of at workaround?

Client 2: Now. So we... We're basically just using we had a very basic opportunity object where we would just basically had meeting notes or just opportunity notes, and we just moved over to, like structured sales process where all of our data is based on the sales stage. Stage one, the stage two stage three with entry and exit criteria. We're moving over to basically structured data that we're reporting on. But we don't have anything that's capturing things automatically. And importing into capture putting on the object. It's all manual input.

Host 1: And all how how good you're right filling up this data?

Client 2: Sorry. Can you say one more time.

Host 1: How good all your reps at filling up that data mandate be important once So in order to move it to the next stage, you have to fill out for...

Client 2: A certain builds and besides that, I'd say there. They're okay. Good not great.

Host 1: Know you still that that the time, it's taking them to fill up the information?

Client 2: Not super concerned at the moment. I think they're okay.

Client 2: But we just just implemented this process probably about month to two months ago. So we're collecting data on it.

Client 2: What I would be a couple questions I would have here is, like, How does this work when you have ten different calls in a sales cycle and they're gonna be and you're updating all this information. Like, do you have next step appended to the previous next steps, is it overwrite, what's the what's set up there?

Host 1: I can tell you how it did today, but I love to hear how you think it should work, because that's that's kind trying to get today it will depend the notes but will override the other fields.

Client 2: Got it. I think a pending would probably be the most interesting thing.

Client 2: Yeah. Like I know typically sales organizations are probably gonna like, override a lot of this material. Like next steps you usually have like, hey, whatever like, the legit next step is. I'm always interested in seeing, like, hit three of next steps.

Client 2: They're, like, hey, What was next step this call was after this call.

Client 2: And just seeing the most recent information. Either at the top of the bottom.

Host 1: I see. And you will not in the field itself. Another phrase the field would get messy we'd, like twenty next steps Depends on how long we call, but Yeah.

Client 2: I'd say it's probably unique to the sales team.

Host 1: one thing we can do too is, like, log a call connectivity too and then just like love in the notes of the collect next step and so so forth.

Client 2: Yeah. I think having something where like, you can select to like, hey, this is information. I wanna capture our small call. This is where it's gonna be and then maybe overwrite there, like, Just having like customization on that. Would be would definitely understand.

Host 1: Yeah. So Is that worth speaking full for you? Is that like sold a bigger point?

Client 2: Not at moment. For us.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: But I haven't felt the... I haven't heard a bunch of feedback my reps or sales directors where it's like, hey, this is taking a lot of time.

Client 2: For them to fill out. Or like, hey, We have a bunch of incomplete data on the opportunity. So I think it wanna for this to be a priority on my end. They would have to be, like, hey, someone bore me on my or someone in the organization is being really loud internally about this. Or I really have a pain point where I can't get insight into deals. Which we definitely had in the past where it was like, hey. Trying to pull any information that wasn't just like a quick summary from an ae on what was going on and the deal was definitely like, I couldn't open up opportunity the object and tell you what was going. In the deal. Like what the next step was or any information about that.

Host 1: Go ahead.

Client 2: No, sorry. Go ahead.

Host 1: Well, the is again, the the beef we did will also just solve yeah like the check here. Like, you was be able to go and you book in any meeting in be like, hey what was it paid like what happened here? But why Yeah.

Client 2: Yes. Yep. Think that's definitely definitely really valuable being able to like, engage with it here and then just having structured data that I know. Like, is gonna be pulled automatically from every single call that we have I think it's definitely interesting. But in terms of, like, pain, I haven't don't experience that on my end right now with my individual role. I would say sales directors or vp vps of sales would probably have more of a pain there.

Host 1: Got it. Interesting.

Client 2: At least how how my role structure to here right now where I'm not getting in the weeds on every single deal and, like, while I'm sitting on forecast calls, that's not necessarily my role.

Host 1: So I'd say, like who's gonna feel the most pain is gonna be a ahead of scale or like a a Cro.

Client 2: Trying to get insights in the deal.

Host 1: I see. Interesting. What do you feel about this is still?

Client 2: Or from the right ops perspective? Yeah. Mean I definitely care about all those things. But again, I'm not hide necessarily to that. Like, number and like, diving in the deals on that granular of level. So again, again, like, I'd have to deal like, either a sales director or someone the sales team is just being loud about that. So I definitely do care about these things.

Client 2: Maybe quite as much as About to basically say is.

Client 2: Is?

Host 1: Yeah. Good.

Client 2: It depends there's lot different aspects my job. So like I'm managing sales operations, marketing operations and customer stuff operations, just depends on the there.

Host 1: How do you get promoted?

Client 2: No idea.

Host 1: Alright? I know what I I really enjoyed the position. Again, if you would be interested, I would love to sign you up as like a design partner. So my goal would even be to, like, get work right to use that that would be my mid goal. It feels like you case the account which makes me more interested. But I feel like we don't have a super yet that that, like, why they keep come for you guys? They're like wow. And so that's what I'm trying to get. And I feel like you Like, I I think it'd be an amazing stuff tell that what what what do you think?

Client 2: Yeah. What what did you have in mind?

Client 2: So with this It this something like It has light as as you wanted to be it'd be like a half a local months or something what we show you will and we ask you a few questions or, like, you could just light as like an email or like a Slack sometimes to time, If you all, It's like, hey, like which of these value prop and h to that's gonna stop.

Host 1: And, you know, you would get access to the Team free access to the product eventually, you know, like, when when and if you subscribe, you'd probably get, like, a crazy deal Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Happy to help for now. Do you wanna to set up a call in, like, a month or so or whatever the next step works for you? I'm I'm down to help That sounds awesome.

Host 1: Yeah. I'll I'll say shoot you an email we can put something on the calendar there.

Client 2: Sweet. Good. Anything I can help with in the meantime?

Host 1: No. That's awesome. Thank you so much vicky you have Beverly like Mike.

Client 2: Yeah. Thanks a lot.
