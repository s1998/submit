Host 1: Yeah. Well, I am mean my own lockdown hometown this week. I mean, I'm calling from Paris right which is also It's good but the weather sucks.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. I mean, I come through from time to time, my my brother is is pretty high up within one of the the big businesses there. So he works in law funds if you know a lot of fonts, obviously, Yeah.

Host 1: It leaves Little Yeah Oh, man.

Host 1: The full guy Yeah.

Client 2: He's is is hate life. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. It's it's nice. You know, again, it's a different lifestyle than here in America. To some degree, but, yeah, I enjoy going to visit for sure.

Host 1: Yeah. It's a it's a good time sure. Well, but but by they were have taken collection on our side. So My name is Kevin. This is Jebediah designing on the team We are... So we'll come called cell ai. Design again. And we are building a dire for sales teams. And so we're looking to rein touch on the market, and and you educate ourselves about the market and the competition and what you will with don't do well. And I believe I found your name online. You were leaving a review for con on G two. So... Yeah. Again, just you able to heal about you and what found good. I'm kick it up, please Can can you give us a quick control of you? What what what do you do and what does you Yeah.

Client 2: I mean, monopoly squared you know, we are a third party call center solution. Right? So, you know, domestically, we have about four hundred agents that are on the phones all day every day, we do use two different dial. You know, we we are actually introducing a a third as well. Currently as we speak, and really, that's simply for redundancy. Right? You know, if you run a a pretty large business or, you know, Bp o if will call it that. You you never really wanna put all your eggs in one bass get because, you know, if that dial breaks or something happens, I mean, you know, god forbid that the business, you know, really, you know, is in a a tight situation. So what we do use a few but can v is is one of our our biggest, you know, use cases And, you know, we've been with them for guess, you know, going on about six years But... Yeah, that's that's ultimately what we do is we're Bp o. Right? We work with businesses to, you know, answer their inbound calls, make their outbound calls do you know, basically warm transfers. Once we get the person on the phone and we maybe verify some information, then we we send it right over to the, you know, qualifying whatever it is. If it's insurance, then we send it to an insurance agent. If it's a mortgage, conversation that we send it to a loan officer if it's something else will then send it to, you know, the credit specialist or whatever whenever vertical we're in. Yep.

Host 1: So is it like support or sales or...

Client 2: So, I mean, sales and customer service, I like to say, yeah.

Client 2: Got it.

Client 2: I really use the word support. I mean, maybe, you know, here in America when I say the word support, like you know, a lot of people think about, like, you know, It or development support. Right? Like, you know, maybe doing like a a quick like, hey. My computer's is not working necessarily or hey I've want this product from you.

Client 2: I need some assisted that's not really our specialty, you know, by any means is is doing like tech support. That's not our specialty.

Host 1: That makes sense. Me move that... So what out the three d that you're using all that to use right now.

Client 2: I mean can con we use five nine as well. Yes. If you're familiar with five nine, And we've just sort of, you know, we're piloting one that again, we we know the business well, but it's called noble biz.

Host 1: Well no no. What?

Client 2: Noble beds.

Host 1: Noble bids Biz.

Client 2: Yep.

Host 1: You know, be.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: You. Yeah.

Host 1: Alright. It's supposed to make you know this one.

Host 1: Have Again.

Client 2: Right? You know, I think they're Was follow the dragon.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: How did you find out about on this all of these players here?

Client 2: Well again, I mean, we've been in the space for, you know, I guess, about twelve years and, you know, again, you know, noble biz is sort of, you know, one of the high ups actually used to work for our business and decided to to, you know, sort of roll over and and make a change. Right? You know, for his family for himself. And and so that's sort of how that's come about. But now, we've been using for a while they're they're pretty large player when it comes to contact center space. Right? I mean, their platform is is used by a lot of folks. I mean, I'd say they're you know their customer network is probably even larger than, you know, larger than can boast necessarily.

Host 1: How do is these players compare also so far Five nine and number of base?

Client 2: I mean, again, you know, there's pros and cons to all of them, but I mean, what I like about con con so is you know, they they use, you know, they do sort of the we'll call it, you know, number administration on the back end. Right? So instead of maybe in a five nine, like you know, I have sort of an employee that every day is rotating numbers to sort of, you know, stay on a spam, that sort of thing. Right? It's more of a manual process, whereas in can, you know, they're sort of doing that for us. And ensuring that numbers are are staying valid and and you know, it helps contact rates. Right? You know, and that's in this world, contact rates are critical.

Host 1: Then know, what does whether this do here to rotate the, Yeah.

Client 2: I mean, since I don't work for con directly, right, you know, I can't say... with one hundred percent certainty, but, you know, my understanding is that again, they have something built within their system on the back end that it knows, hey, I've made a hundred dials on this Did Right? So hey I need to rotate it. And and I use the number one hundred, I'm not saying that exactly what it is. I see Jebediah shaking and his head. Yes. But, you know, i use the number hundred, but, you know, and then, hey, let me use a different one. And it's a local presence. Right? So ultimate you know, hey, if you're area code two zero one, I'm gonna dial from a two zero one number of your area codes, seven zero four, I'll gonna call you for a seven zero four number. If it's this, I'm calling you from this. Right? And so they just have a bunch of those on the back end, and they're constantly rotating I don't know, like, from, you know, a a total build I can't really explain how they do that, but, you know, that sort of you know, how it work, Does that mean that the individual collar does not get to choose the phone number to use.

Host 3: It's just kind of randomly automatically assigned for the. Based on who they're calling.

Client 2: Exactly. So like, you know, if I have a list of ten people like and they're all different area codes, you know, gonna call each of them from there... distinct area account. And then. And then, you know, but the next time they get a call, it might not be from that same number from that same area. You see in. So Then so if I called you five times, you may get called for me from five different number.

Host 3: Okay. Does that get the?

Client 2: Known that if Jebediah has a missed call on his phone, and he now just season it and close it back, it knows to flow it in a appropriately. Right, Not to be cliche with with flows name, but it it knows to to flow it in properly and and where route it to.

Host 1: Okay. What make... Sorry. Did you have any questions about this Jebediah?

Host 3: No.

Host 1: With all your favorite things well, I guess, so the favorite and least favorite things about con five nine and that will be. So I guess, that's kind of six questions. Yeah.

Client 2: You know top things are, you know, their supervisor, you know, being a super pfizer and managing the people. Right? They're screens, you know, it's very clean. You know, it's easy to recognize, like, who's on a call? Like, who's there on a bathroom break? Who's, you know, dewey x y and z. Right?

Client 2: You know, start interrupt.

Host 3: Is is this con so that you're talking about...

Client 2: So can... Oh so... Yeah. Correct. So... Yeah. We're we're... now we're just focus solely our.

Client 2: So Okay so their supervisor, you know, access is very good. Right, at the top, it sort of, you know, has hey, you know, how many calls have you made today? You know, how many leads are in the hopper, like, you know, what's the abandoned rate? What you know, the you know, average wait time for an agent in between calls like, what's the average, you know, disposition time? Like, all these sort of... Will call high level stats. And then it has, like, Hey, how many agents are logged in? How many are waiting? How many are in a call how many are parts. Right? And then you have the the breakdown sort of by person. So hey, you know, this agent Denise is on Right? And has been talking for two minutes. Hey, this Andrew. Agent Petrovina is, you know, not on call and has been waiting for a minute and three seconds for his next call right? So it shows you all of this. In a very easy way. And then from there, I can whisper. That's important. Right? Like, maybe I need to be like, hey, Jebediah. Go to lunch. Right? Like, so I can whisper in, you know, and and sort of say, hey, Jebediah. This Thompson here, you know, from the management team, please, you know, go ahead and and log yourself out. I need you to go to lunch. Right? And and I can do that. Or I can barge into a call. Maybe Jebediah is like, raising his hand and saying like, hey, Oh my god. Like, I have an Irate customer on the line. I wanna, you know, somebody needs to take it, you know, care of this guy or or gal, Well then I can board right in. Right? And I could say, hey, Jebediah. My name is Thompson. I'm a manager here with X y company.

Client 2: You know, I'll be glad to assist you. So that, I'd say supervisor, that's very important right? Because that's how we make critical decisions for how many agents do we need in? How many agents should we like be sending home? You know how many calls are remaining all those things. Right? Like, that's very important. Don't talk about their they're reporting. So then not looking at live, that that I would call real time now we're digesting like, how do we perform yesterday? How do we perform last week, how do we perform last month? Their reporting is very good. You know, it's very clean cut very easy and concise to read right? They or when it comes to reporting their accessibility is key. Right? Whereas you know, now comparing it to a five nine. Five nine is a very big company that's global that, you know, again has clients within a lot of different you know, countries, what we'll call it, whereas I'd say, can boast those client bases majority Us based you know, five nine, if I need something to be changed, like, hey, guys, I want you to add this, you know, this field. Right? Like speed delete. We'll use that it as an example. Right? Like, I want you to show me what my speed delete is. Five nine, I have to send in an enhancement, you know, whatever, you know, ticket and god forbid, that's not to say that it'll be fulfilled. That's just like Hey, we see it. Thank you flow for submitting and, like, if we feel like we should... then we might entertain it and we might reach out to you. But I can tell you over the past four years, I've submitted probably eight of those and I've never gotten a callback. Right? So you know, and and I still have to do all of that manually by manipulate manipulated, you know, manipulate probably isn't the right word, but manually computing what that those values or or needs are. Where Can? I can go right to the owner, but I also, you know, have that relationship and I can hey, guys. This is critical to my business within twenty four hours, they'll make the change. Right? You know, they get their dev team right into it. But they know that when I bring it, it's gonna be something silly and stupid it's gonna be something that look globally every one of my clients probably once what Thompson once. And and so i wanna deploy this thing as soon as possible. And so that's very good. You know, and they're reporting again, it's it's very easy. Right? You can export it you can automate it. A big thing is Reporting to automate is important, especially if you work with a Bp like ourselves you know, I have a lot of different clients that are I'm dealing with a lot of different campaigns. And so I wanna send Jebediah his specific information I wanna said flow his specific information. I send Thompson his specific information so I wanna be able to automate those in like, roll data logs to those clients. So being able to email every day at seven Am or every day at eleven Pm or, you know, every week, you know, or every month, you know, there's different cadences But again, those opportunities are very good as well. Yeah.

Host 3: Got it. Cool. Yeah.

Host 1: Oh, it is. So so many... So you think that that's to take on here Tell me moment the reporting bit. Like, what kind of metrics do you like to hold on?

Client 2: I I think it's, you know, important that, you know, you do see, hey, you know, In our business, we do a lot of transfer. So it's sort of like what is the first leg? So if I call Jebediah? I hey, Jebediah, You know? How are you today? I'm trying to, you know, sort of get in hit him to buy into what I I'm sort of selling. Right? Then we put Jebediah on hold. We attempt to second leg. Right, which is to say the client. So I'm calling Jebediah because I wanna sell on insurance. Home in auto insurance. Right in America everyone has have only insurance. On the Jebediah auto insurance, Well now, maybe I matched him with say Liberty mutual and like a insurance provider. Right? So now I put Jebediah on hold I called liberty mutual. I bring them on the line. They answer. I say, Hey, Betty. This is Thompson. I have Jebediah on the line. He's interested in car insurance in the state of Florida. When you're ready, I can bring them on the line and and hand them over. Yeah. I'm ready. Thompson. Great. Boom I connect in Jebediah Now I say, hey, Jebediah. You still with me. Yeah. I'm here Thompson. Great Jebediah. I have Betty from Liberty. She's gonna be your you know, your agent and get you that free quote now. Hope you guys have a great day. I'm gonna drop from the line. I disconnect that sort of creates a third leg. Right? We'll call it. So it's important to be able to see the difference because What happens is in our business, a lot of payments are on der duration Right I'm sure you guys have heard this. Hey, on a two minute duration or a three minute duration So once we transfer, it's critical we have to know how long did that call go for after we disconnect the line? Make sense, So type critical You know, I spoke on speed lead hyper critical that if I in just a lead a lot of our partners are posting these things at real time Api.

Client 2: And we're digesting them into our dial. So they post it right now, On eastern time, twelve fifty Pm they wanna see that literally two seconds later, I'm dialing it at twelve fifty dot zero two. Right? Like you know, they wanna know that speed lead is critical because if not, somebody else dialogue on fast and they're the guy that's gonna sell.

Host 1: Right? Do you they also do deals also do any coaching for your team, like beyond beyond is like high level metrics, you get get into the of the call as well?

Client 2: Oh, for sure. Yeah. We we record every call that's important. You know, we you have to be able to to listen to the calls certainly.

Client 2: Yes. We have a full day how.

Host 1: Do you But who does that? Do you do that personally no or or who does that? And how does the we're.

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, we have a Qa department that listens to the calls, and then they do a score, we have a global scorecard for a business over the time, we we know what's important to grade on and then, you know, they they send that score cord into a portal where our agent can see what their grade is on that particular call. And then the the coach that is assigned to them can see that call as well. Right, in that grade. And then basically, based on, you know, if it's an a, they're not even gonna reach out to the agent. Right? Like, hey, you passed, your you're good. But if it's a d well, they're gonna, you know, then look at the score them yourselves are sort of alerted within the portal. They're gonna review that, and then the coach is the one that talks. To that agent and has the one on one coaching to say, Hey, Here's where you start. You didn't rebuttal. You didn't do this or that. Right? You know, I would say There is no dial out there that does a full transcription of the calls like, writes it out. You know, if you're building a dial, that could be a really good feature. I mean, that would be critical to me right now is you know, if somehow you could transcribe the call as well.

Host 1: Interesting, why why would that be good for you?

Client 2: Because then I can set parameters as to, hey, you know, here's the the rebuttal that I want them to say and I can almost, like, distinguish hey, on these calls, we did report. Right? On these calls, they didn't use the rubber. You see what I'm saying? So it's almost like a smart, you know, solution to be able to know, hey, where are we failing Like, where I can almost tell from Mike how long the transcription is, like, where are we falling off? Like, maybe that script needs to be tweaked a little bit. You follow me Right.

Host 1: The little moment that Qa department that grades your agents how many qa do you have agent? All the other the way around?

Client 2: So I mean, we try to qa a one out a thirty call.

Host 1: Got it. So you have roughly one qa pills still the agents.

Client 2: Also so like yeah, i An agent can make you know, roughly a hundred and fifty calls or like a predictive dot in an hour. Right? So our expectation is that, you know, Qa is is then, you know, trying to listen to, you know, ultimately, like, five of those.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Some of them are only twenty seconds. Right? Some of them our our longest calls in our business, typically are, like three minutes at the longest. Interesting.

Host 1: Then you know that's the the throwing in, like, the bulging. Do you use that as well personally?

Client 2: Yes. So I mean, whisper is, you know, where only the agent can hear. Right? So only the direct person that's within the dial can hear me. So if if you and Jebediah, were on a phone call because you had called Jebediah on the dial, and I actually whisper it, like, you know, if I was listening as a coach, And I heard Jebediah say something. I could almost like, feed you the rebuttal flow, like I could say, hey, fuck. Say this. Right? And like, Jebediah would not hear me, but you would hear. Try, it's almost like if you were on a blind date and you had your your airpods in and Jebediah was feeding near the good lines, to tell your girlfriend. Right?

Client 2: Ultimately, you would hear but not the customer. Whereas everyone can hear me now. Like bo in means like you know, both parties can hear. And you would only really use that if, like, they're asking for, like, manager assist.

Host 1: Right And how often do they do that?

Client 2: I'd say bo in. I'd say probably you know look, we make you know, hundreds of thousands of dials a day I'd see that that probably happens forty or fifty times a day. Right? You know and then I'd say, like, wi whispering you know, probably three to four hundred times a day.

Host 3: Sorry. How many calls are you make in a day? Overall, you know, hundreds a thousand So you know, on Somewhere between, like, a hundred and three hundred k every day.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 3: Okay. Awesome.

Host 3: And it's how many sense this whisper mode happened?

Client 2: Maybe, you know, like I said, you know, I'm not the one wish So, you know, don't quote me but I'd say probably, you know, three, four five hundred times. Right? You know, And and then, you know, maybe the board to then talk to the client, maybe forty or fifty.

Host 3: Got it. Yeah. Thank you.

Client 2: I do, you know, I i know that we set this. I Just wanna be transferred. I do only have about two three minutes, and then some others are are probably gonna join me on another Zoom call. So I do apologize sounds good.

Host 1: So that's let's then. Do you... Anything you dislike about So dislike is, you know, Probably, you know, I'd say some of the the scripted, like, the way that you lay out the scripting right?

Client 2: You know, it's it's almost like an Iv module it's like, hey, drop this in and then there's like a drawn line and then it's like here's another little bubble of like, he here's what's gonna happen next and then here's a line over to here a lot over to here. Like, don't like that setup up. Like, almost like, you know, because you almost need to know a little bit of Html code to, like be a true resourceful person. Now I do. Right. But I would say, you know, for some of my my lower level colleagues that I want to be able to make changes to the scripts they just don't have that expertise. And so it makes it challenging. So I would say the Most dumb down opportunity that you can make scripting would be best for probably the people that you would be selling into. If if you follow what I'm saying.

Host 1: Yeah. Totally.

Client 2: I'm so right.

Client 2: Well and then and then I would say Some of their Api functionality is not good. Right? Like, a big thing for us, you know, to be, you know, compliant and all that. Like, we wanna hold our data know, we need to hold our data for five years to for safety. Dry. And so some of that is a little cumbersome, whereas some some other you know, dollars like the Api is really easy. You know, but but some of their Api integrations are a bit more like I said robust and, you know, they they don't like to speak with with some systems. Yeah.

Host 1: That's question. Just I really to understand you a use case. Really... Are you mostly Handle inbound, Mostly outbound.

Client 2: Yes. I guess an example the.

Client 2: It's one o'clock we've made, you know, fifty two thousand outbound calls and inbound calls, we've got a thousand two hundred. So fifty two thousand to twelve hundred. Yeah.

Host 1: Got it. Great. Awesome tip alright.

Client 2: Well, thank you do this so much because it's a missed coal and their returning call. Yeah. No it sense.

Host 1: Okay. Well, thank you so much, let me super appreciate your time today. Yeah. You have a great one.

Client 2: Yes. Thank you guys.

Host 1: Yeah. Thank you,
