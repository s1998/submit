Client 1: Good afternoon goes.

Client 2: Hey, guys. How's it going.

Client 1: Solid can complain.

Client 2: Love to here looking fresh with that suit and time Yeah.

Client 2: I wish I looked like that right now. Otherwise might gonna two ones.

Client 3: Same here man.

Client 2: Like, you're... Yeah. Your picks looking pretty sharp as well.

Client 3: Yeah. When you're in Multi cloud networking you just talking to a bunch of techie. So like, gotta look part.

Client 2: There you go. Is Does anybody is mark or Topper, or those guys joining today, do you guys know or Yeah.

Client 3: They should. If Mark doesn't join ten five minutes, i'm pretty sure we can just drop and get back to our cold calls.

Client 2: Cool. Cool. And you luck for you guys out there today? How's it been?

Client 3: And I just got tore up by x route customer.

Client 3: Yeah. It was like, So maybe if you know, this... So he just is not having any claims issues at all. And he was like, if you're if you're from Ra, I don't want anything to do the no now now. I was like, without percent of route when I was like, order protection.

Client 2: He goes if anything like that I just don't need shipping coverage, he goes.

Client 3: I don't understand why... Because I don't have a high claims amount. And there's there been any business or fifteen years? It maybe one or two a year. He goes I don't see the value in adding a fee to my customer when we're not having any claim issues.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 3: Like those are for sure.

Client 2: It sounds like the one that Kelly mentioned in the chat the other day.

Client 3: Yeah. So it's just like he was like, I'm not having any issues, but I'm like, there some there's people are paying for shipping covers, Like, when they check out, maybe it's unknown to you, but they're still paying Ups or Fedex or something to to cover it. Right? He was like, no. Like, so I don't see the value in adding you know, an extra two dollars or one dollar and ninety eight cents.

Client 3: I wonder what his order volume was.

Client 2: Because, like, if they're usually if there's only one or two client... I feel like there's only one or two claims a year, then they can't be doing that high of volume normally, I would think Yeah.

Client 3: Exactly. Right. So So that may just not a great fit, but then again.

Client 3: Yeah Sometimes, there's like, claims that could be coming up with customers, but then they're just not reaching out to the store.

Client 2: That's the only thing that I've said to that is like, there could be some navy diet. Are going undiscovered but it's a tough one for sure. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Well, Yeah. Yeah. He said his piece, and hung that.

Client 2: Fair enough.

Client 3: Yeah. Exactly. Because like, i all next.

Client 4: Guys. Talking about some of the the route leads i send up. We're just distraught.

Client 3: Yeah. Just the guy, he had used the route, but he just didn't see the value in it because he's not having any shipping coverage issues. So he just didn't see the value in adding you know the nine eight cents or two dollars to each attachments each package that's going out. You just I don't see the value in that because I don't have any claim issues. So I was like true. I mean, i guess, it's gonna have in any claims. Issues, then really nothing we can do here. And I tried talking about revenue share, but get it his big concern is... He just doesn't wanna charge his customers any extra money. For shipping coverage. I was like alright Yeah.

Client 4: That... I mean, there there are a lot of smaller probably we don't even have the claim volume to justify doing insurance and they do it just for the revenue share. But that's always gonna be dependent on the person their business model, you know has not yeah maybe out a product where it's like, more profitable to just get those conversions than to risk Like losing all for, you know, that two dollars.

Client 4: Insurance. So And then I spoke with another prospect and she was like, yeah.

Client 3: Like, you know, we do It's like winter gear. So she's like, you know during the summer it's slow. She goes sometimes we have zero a month, but she goes in in our busy month under during the winter, which is right now. I'm might okay. What was she gonna say? Now she goes about twenty my. Twenty packages a month. I'm like, oh, yeah.

Client 3: This is like, I...

Client 2: I tell staying up.

Client 3: Yeah. No she was like... Oh, yeah. Like I'd love to meet with you guys. Yeah. It's send over an email. And. I was like I'm not gonna to follow ups. Sorry. Like, there's just there's no revenue there for us. So Yeah. I say alright. Onto the next. But man it's just what it is. You know?

Client 4: So that's like Are you connected with people that are actually like still using around?

Client 3: Yeah. One guy. I was like, we've got that covered. I was like, any chance are using route and you just gone up. But it's like some people it... It's just the personality of the, you of yeah.

Client 3: The prospect we're speaking, with that's all it is, you know. Some people are like oh, yeah, we use ra their more than open to overs share their their experience with Route. And those are the ones that she could talk to and, you know, get to see the value here at Op and, you know, get a meeting with them. And, you know, have our Aes you know, change their mind and have them switch to Op o, but sometimes, you know, people are just sometimes they're just having a bad day, Maybe you didn't have this cup coffee. You. So he's he's he's gonna take it out on mute. It's no hard feeling. It's just a the talent to shake it off and then tends to go on to the next.

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. That's why mean, at the end of the day, it's really like Like the numbers came. Because I think So I think I was I was doing some yesterday. And I think the run rate for us is that Yes. You know, who an Sdr here based on, like the metrics the last few months does a hundred dollars a day. probably get about twenty meetings booked and then have fifteen of them show up. So it's just like you know, for all the nose, just that much closer to another yes. The think just thing is to make sure we're still getting good answer rates. Eventually for our customers and someone will Say guess. No those all actually probably convert higher.

Client 3: Me too. I I agree that I think it's a higher conversion rate just because they're familiar with the space. So that's our job to present that value, but Yeah. Yeah. Just a little bit of a rough day today.

Client 4: Got it. Are you guys about each chance still calling into any of those floor leads i I think those.

Client 3: Okay. Yeah. Called a couple today. No answers, but I noticed that on my list. I know that I saw flo on a couple of them.

Client 4: Yeah. We got pretty large on it. Quality nice and how to join I kinda excited about that. So what I'm probably gonna do you guys don't really have to doing things here is go into the some of these calls. Call sequences. The just prioritize them? So that if it is, like, a forest or a route customer those will. Those will be the next highest priorities here after After those, like Folks so you know, Open any email three times in a room.

Client 3: Okay. Okay. Cool What about on Andrew and and Kelly how are you guys ended up talking to me folks the route list.

Client 4: I know Kelly you still... I've get a out leftover for nothing then the listed Anastasia company can continue up on seven some tasks that build up lawyer out.

Client 1: For sure. I'm catching up on the south right now. So like, with the new route only or people have experience? Customers. I haven't really made a debt in. So I'm gonna start moving over on that. So because me if just up no zone those open slash.

Client 4: Test, those are always gonna be the best ones because there...

Client 1: Okay.

Client 4: So you don't need to switch up here your flow, like, all all going on the back end and change the party list. So if you're just organizing your calls by priority, then just keep this keeps sticking to that animation show.

Client 1: Look at my priority and also about, like, some because I'm only doing like Ps right l.

Client 1: So Just trying over Yeah I'm just giving you an idea of what I'm doing.

Client 4: Okay. Yeah. That's what. I mean, obviously, times on optimization was also like, the most important thing because you know, people people East Coast like, they're calling at the end of the day sometimes the best took time to get up all of markets to go get them. Right up, sir. That's happening.

Client 1: For sure, like, earlier in the morning, just like sacrificing like, like a day to just do it in the morning, like like, seven or something. I like a good block being able to speak to them on their time.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean, as also as team grows, you probably won't Oh well not be, like, front of minus than you need to do since we have northeast east coast perhaps like I do get Kelly, for example, more leads somebody me is best to the best probably get. And there's still like, ton of like, California is probably the biggest stayed out there for just for commerce experience like bit more than not good you guys just on california to be honest.

Client 1: For sure one hundred percent. That's what I'm saying too of, like, for what I've booked. They primarily only been, like like Ps. We had Ps account. So I was like, oh, can only imagine, like, what I haven't been... What I haven't contacted yet to try to dig out something like that es to tabs just because of, like, for what I've booked it's all been all West coast account. So I'll try to just, like, spread it out and make sure that I give everything in fair chance know.

Client 4: Yeah. Yeah yeah. Definitely there It it is nice though And the Commerce just There is a lot more business on the on the West Coast. Compared to, like, when call into manufacturing companies, and everybody's like in the nebraska. And every like, you're not gonna you're talking it get a lot of meetings don't. Do at least a couple of calls like a right point.

Client 1: For sure. And then Do we have, like a loose pricing sheet to some people?

Client 4: You know, there's a lot of factors that go. Definitely wouldn't wanna send anyone of pricing sheet without a conversation.

Client 4: Okay. There's a lot of factors that go into it, but people want information I mean, at the end of the day, they're not gonna charge anything. It's just but, like, when they ask pricing. It's It's just like but they're their customers take on the charge, but if they wanted to know that exact fee. I guess the best answer would be charles talking people. You know, there's a few different factors that go into it like you know what you're what your It'll is your order value. You know, potentially and a couple other things and just telling me that one is quote, but like, you'll connect them with the... That's why you're looking to connect them with the Yep. The account executive to get that information.

Client 1: Yeah. With this particular case, this guy, like, he will... He... He was sent generic email Then like, he I agree that he agree that after looked at the email, you would agree to follow up with like a call for, like, next week for next Tuesday.

Client 1: But then, like, between that time, he was, like, hey. Can you give me like something for pricing and like, what you said was like that was like at the top of my head. I was like, well, it's really a case by case basis a I can't. Like just thinking you about hard respond him, but I'll just say, because I don't wanna you, that's really something for you to speak with the monica bell.

Client 4: Yeah. Either was free. Right? You'd like, Yeah.

Client 1: For sure.

Client 1: Like Yeah.

Client 4: But are I Fortunately, we're not running for that pricing question. As much here as when we actually so you have a product. That cost money, what i deal. That. Can be annoying where they're like, I don't been talk and make a be pricing fitness just basically trying to to Yeah Another thing like I've done in the past is if I don't know any answer to a question, and they're being pretty adamant about it.

Client 5: Like, they asked me the question maybe a couple times or they're just just asking a question that I can't answer. I'll just be like, Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just a beating maker. Actually, So so can get on that with you, what time do you have available next week for a quick you know, Ten minutes thing. We'll take up to much of your time Just ten minutes. Well, you can answer question. And then they're like, yeah.

Client 4: Yeah. Actually, that is something that use to see employees where and that as a call, it's a little harder.

Client 4: About, like but, you know, oh, do you have, like, But I can get you pricing me candidates minutes and, like, an steering flag, Like but, like, how he's assisting next to each other? If you if you see someone on mind that you can take them like, when wait or just so like, hey, you take a quick? But called style price That that is that is option. And another is, like, if they're really really pressing on it, you can Potentially and you know, can like yep. Like, when when I started here and I was doing some call calling, I would get still like, kinda test messaging i definitely got a good amount of people that were like, I'm interested. I'm not target And I would just pass them to Danny and he would follow with them directly and put the meeting with them. Well, I'm just saying because our goal is to book meetings So...

Client 5: Yeah. I mean, we're gonna try to push them in a meeting. You know, Yeah.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean... And you guys sometimes there's situation where someone is asking you really like, a question you tell know the answer to. And We don't really have a complex enough technical products it to come up as often optimism it might in other scenarios, but there could be a situation where they want it. Like, hey, tommy, you know, tell me you're, like, the names of three other food manufacturers that you work with. I need to see that in in a in a message before I leave a meeting or or something kinda just so they're like, making you work harder of necessarily. Cool so aside from that How are you guys doing with it's still writing, so getting, like the people that you booked. In January two Sorry booked in December two kinda to the meetings that we're set up january.

Client 1: I'm about to find out next week. I have three that were booked in December for January. So we'll see how that goes? So I'm just I'm just going to be free ramped with my outreach and make sure that I follow with them some so that there's no, like, no shows that I can prevent. Of course you can't prevent all no, but for the ones that like try of control, I'm just try to do that.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean, it's long as long as like can more. You know trying to send a confirmation in a very information to day before and morning out let's as much as you can hear. As well as, you know, setting expectations really for the days, you know, like, hey. That's good chances might right now.

Client 1: Oh, for sure, I definitely always i'm realistic about, like, a meeting type fits like he they're interested, but they might not be a good account. I'm like, hey, it's something or it's just like just like being like, realistic for both of our time of like what it's gonna be just because you never know. Everything should be treated fairly, but then it's just like you can... You can't really tell them until these speak with that person see. There's yesterday if there, you know? So Yes.

Client 4: Cool, and then so how did Have you guys kind been doing with hitting the the daily door? For at before i guess. And are thinking that you said you were, like, looking to get for you. You ended up getting yeah.

Client 1: I to one. So I was trying to book three. So definitely said not meet that goal. But I'm still gonna strive for today. Though I even though I missed it by a lot. So wanna push for it I got something up there. So I need to just turn up the energy a little bit and get Well it's two more.

Client 4: Yeah. Mentioned the it shouldn't give it's easy ahead and it's kinda kinda so case like the purpose.

Client 1: What like if you end it's like good, but it's like probably could've have done more. That's what trying get that mentality and like he gets you where like go. Just see a little bit more. Nice.

Client 4: Okay. What about kelly what about you?

Client 5: I got two yesterday. Today I'm already at one. So Nice.

Client 5: Hopefully get to four Today what what was on?

Client 4: Any kinda of unique unique ones there like, as far as I'm taking the beating aside from this like, you know, what we have to The typical pitch.

Client 5: Basic stub. Shown. The too crazy.

Client 4: I think it's just the connection rate, you know is the the problem normally, I would get over five every day, But, like, just the connection rate here is a little lower So just means you to make more calls.

Client 5: I really wanna get to do like a hundred and twenty calls today. I'm already at forty. So I'm just, like slow today. Again, I'm I'm down with the sickness. You know, Are you I think so that's who you guys can having.

Client 4: So.

Client 5: Oh, I'm just saying I'm sick. I'm not saying everybody in general.

Client 4: No. We set up insurance like.

Client 5: Yeah. I mean, it's kinda been that way since it started though. Everything's it's harder to get people on the phone.

Client 4: You mean the the speakers.

Client 3: She's saying in general just from the whole company to this company, but it just because a whole different industry or selling to whole different people.

Client 3: I you can't control, like, connection rates. It's just they pick up where they don't.

Client 5: Yeah. But that's why I highly recommend the double tap. I used to double tap and I'd get more people, but It's hard to double tap here because we don't have control over the the stuff but kinda given up on that because there's no solution.

Client 4: You can still do a double tap if wanted.

Client 4: Yeah you are talking about just calling twice.

Client 3: Is that what you needed by double tap?

Client 5: Yeah. Like, I usually called twice in a day. And you get more results that way, but I don't know how to... Because every time I try to set a new task, it doesn't work or just kinda given up. I don't get it. So I'm not doing it I don't know. Maybe that's a bad...

Client 5: Unless somebody's, like, call me back, then I'll put them on my Google calendar because then it will tell me to call them back.

Client 4: Mean there are a couple ways that could be automated or done. You want me I can I can show you there I wanna one. Because I like the double the double tapping thing can be a smaller. Done that too just in the sense of having a list of, like, leads it aren't necessarily the campaign, but I have them on my, like, a a hot task list.

Client 5: Guess, what I could do is just call a certain number across specs and then just recall them, like, halfway through the day, circle back. But I think they disappear once you talk to. Yeah. Give here.

Client 4: I mean, Given up give up.

Client 4: There's like, if if it's something you wanna try it or but that you find used small those space to two. I or were just the process might be a little different than what it is.

Client 5: Yeah. It's just so complex because normally, you know, you set like, when you're in the call on the actual call screen, it says, follow up. You click the thing and then bam. It just pops up in your calls. But this is like, you have to do this and this and that and listen this and this just to set up thing just over complicated Okay.

Client 4: Well, yeah. Let's we could we can walk through. Roger That's just enough of my warning for today though.

Client 4: That's alright. No. I mean, technology can always be annoying when it's Okay. I mean, that that's the point of technology as I think too spend saw sometimes. Sent on what about your end On connection rates?

Client 4: Noticed on you got...

Client 4: I think the deal ago yesterday was, like, just to get like one or two... I think it was two mains day I wanted to.

Client 3: Yeah. Nothing has changed in last I mean, it's never gonna change. It's only to say in goals. I mean, it's it's always going to be try to get three meetings every day, but, you know, some days are tougher than others. But I mean, the goal stays the same it's never changing. Unless, like, quote change, then and then the... Then we have to get up in meetings. But Yeah. Definitely trying to get around three a day. Been a little difficult, but Yeah. Goal is always the same. It's always still over cheap.

Client 4: But, yeah. It looks like You're you had a pretty good connection right today is time. A month good like, having on the wrong people Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I I did I had a really good connection right today. I've had good conversations and I just take the positives from them, and I just try to learn from it. You know, if there's anything I don't know, I tell Give him a callback back or sometimes she's beneficial just to hear what kind of problems they're having or what problems they're not having and know, every day, we just get one percent better.

Client 4: Yeah. Talking to people is Yeah. Really really still the best case scenario a lot of times. There are a lot of scenarios are people just one to pick up. So we're getting. Yes. Definitely to our back. Okay. Well, I wanna keep you guys kinda too long if there was anything else like major I did go through unless anyone else have, like, any roadblocks they're talking my questions they get.

Client 3: Nope. I'm I'm okay. Okay.

Client 2: I with you guys?

Client 4: Yeah. I'll all you guys and get back to it. Be a nice nice job somewhere far like this month is definitely taking out Are you feeling better James?

Client 2: It's a bit of a work in progress. But just trying to add a little bit slowly each day. And just building up, but still not really doing the the volume that I wanna be at, but that's. What's?

Client 5: Did you get the blue blockers?

Client 2: Not yet. No. I just didn't been trying to to close my eyes when it gets bad, but I think it needs to kind of adjust anyways, but I'll consider maybe doing that. And seeing if it see if it helps.

Client 5: Yeah. They have blue blockers and red blockers. Glasses.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 4: Yeah. People keep that in mind for sure.

Client 4: Yeah. That's good. That's it's a good point because they're Like the computer screen is too bright or too low. Just what, I remember having a confession like I can start my someone what the thirty seconds. Cool. Alright. Well, oli that's gonna get get back to cannot. Talk to you lead by there later on unfair Alright have a good day.
