In January. So basically, only two two weeks more. If we we... Yep. But anyways, I think from Christmas and new year eve most of us will be on need so that's that's okay. I think it's a good time to meet you guys. Especially our key partners and and vendors. So back to the the background. So i I think you you you may have some ideas of what happens in the past not only two years during the Covid. The pandemic, but also the social and seen in Hong kong in twenty nineteen. Right? So basically, the whole travel industry in hong kong lost whole three years. It it was tough. And especially to con it it was even more challenging because I think you should be aware of the news that connects and announced that we were going to scale down. In June. So it was a tough decision by the Previous. But then I I think also a good opportunities for... Yeah for everyone. To review and we build everything. So actually... So in October, I think our October party just correct me if I wrong or or yep. Confused. The three d equip merged we have the travel. So Trouble, of course, you you you have better ideas, maybe a more better than me. I very very long history and very eight to the T for the corporate clients.

Client 6: So... Yeah. From from the license number, you know how long history we have. So it... It's... We have a good reputation in the market. Just that because of the Covid and all stuff that's why we... We had to scale down. They're with the really group support and we are back to the markets again. So so I think you you want to know more about what what is pretty good. And what are they doing?

Client 2: So So yeah.

Client 6: In the nutshell, so Really grip it wars start up So I I I think it it was because I think the scale and and the manpower the the stop size is quite back at a moment, and we are growing. So three group is it it was a startup up based in Hong Kong. And i'm so office it was a it is an It company. And very dedicated into the travel industry. So a apology, I think maybe I I just passed this back to you it seems more suitable for you to talk about what you were offering, especially in the product side and the service side. Okay?

Client 7: Yeah. Sure. So happy to for that. So as Enrique have said, our company has been mean, how that? We we established in two thousand fifteen. I'm I'm trying to grab you guys are a quick slice so that you can have a look We are you don't.

Client 7: Yeah. So while i'm I I I I continue searching that right slides. So anyway, so So we as a start, we start in twenty nine fifteen, So obviously, we are very focused on Ai chatbot which is more on doing smart recommendations to some of the travel business.

Client 7: We work with a lot of airlines as well as sound as well as okay some of the tourism board aviation. So allow me to share my screen now so that you can see a bit a history who we are.

Client 2: Yep.

Client 7: K.

Client 7: Able to share my screen Unfortunately, Yeah.

Client 2: Let me just sorry.

Client 7: I have to just seven. No. Nice. I mean, I can continue. With my speech.

Client 2: Okay. Try now. Sorry too.

Client 7: Okay. Oh, So no.

Client 7: I know but the okay.

Client 2: You know could you please try again now? Okay. Just Okay.

Client 7: No. Accounts.

Client 7: Okay. So here we go. So Okay. About it. So so we... I sprint group, we have been presence in more than ten countries Particularly, we have office and Hong kong. So Hong kong is our headquartered and then Singapore so which is where another key offices that we have. Obviously, Shanghai as well as Dubai, London, and we are opening up our offices in Japan and Australia right now. So So, basically, we... As as a a seven years old out of we are growing our global expansion right now. Obviously, in twenty nineteen, we did have a downturn tone we were we were done downsizing due to the the the Covid as I think everyone is... I mean, most of the companies in the world. But I think last two years, we are doing pretty good. We turn back with a great growth, particularly we growth our manpower from a thirty so people back to eighty and then this year, we are back off to, like, over two hundred. Excluding counting all team. So obviously, the the team is very focused as I've just mentioned, we are very focused starting with our Ai chatbot solution as an It company. And then moving forward, we are actually focusing on a lot of like, play solutions that offers to various verticals. So if you have a chance to look into our web side, basically, we are offering smart solutions. And then recently, we have a very global extensive collaboration with Samsung and Google in promoting their so called second generation Service sls. Which we call Rcs. The rich rich communication services. So where we can actually do a lot of i mean, innovative stuff are through the Sms messages. Including... I mean, chat solutions, check commerce, where we are bringing a lot of values to our enterprise customer. So probably you will ask why an It company acquired Yeah.

Client 7: So so Connect us basically have a very strong T background as you know, they have a lot of good and global customer. So many of them are enterprise customers, which you can find a lot of, like overlapping and and synergy that we will be able to to see. So this is also why we are making a good effort in doing this acquisition. And basically, we have completed that in November this year. So we are right now moving up and trying to resume all the entire business. So I think Enrique and the team is right now busy getting other recruitment particularly towards the a and I think there's a lot of people are looking for for job opportunity. So we're trying to rebuild a team right now from the side, while freight Group is making a full support with with these folks. So and at the same time, we are trying to transform connects us from just a purely T into a digitized at T company. So this is more of a bit of a background. So any any particular questions from you guys?

Host 1: No. I think I helped give us Confused to why the it company was tell me or how you'd be supporting so i wanted to make sure we were sharing the right information Yes.

Host 1: I think this is probably built a lot of synergy in in the future, obviously, because we do have a lot of customers not just limited to mean, just now I talk about airlines aviation as well as some of the tourism board.

Client 7: Obviously a lot of the partners in the market which is coming from the the travel agent side as well. So... Yeah. So this is also why we are bringing so many people into this this meeting. Hopefully, we can learn a bit more about your company as well as I mean, what exactly the system and data you are providing so that we can learn more Selwyn.

Client 2: That's that's wonderful. Keith do you wanna say me all or do you already no.

Host 1: I think to get it. You need to the interest of time and go ahead and jump right into So you what what it is we do? And how we can help? And then allow a little bit of time after work for some questions and follow So again, thank you also for joining.

Client 2: I know everyone's very busy taking time off and getting on this meeting, I do appreciate everyone of you being on the call. Thank you for that. Just a very quick background. My name is Sanjay For those who joined play. I'm the founder and Ceo of Biometrics, I started this business back in between thirteen of twenty twelve. And I've been in the trial industry for more than twenty five years. Had a lot more head. Yeah. When I started, look less now but, you know, I have on through all the ups and downs and the the acceleration and the, you know, dilemma we all face to the industry for period of time. So I... I'm gonna show you the system I don't want this to be a monologue there are so many people here. Everyone has a different aspect. I would really encourage questions in you know, guys jump in and ask whatever questions you want take this take us through your side of it as well. Problem here.

Client 7: Yeah. Yeah. Probably, I I should have introduced a team as well. I mean, basic leave the team here, I have people from It team So our Cio when ben is here, Pony, which Here, we have filed financed here Jason. Obviously, we have the team with Enrique as general manager and also my tech team, which is most of those program manager which are supporting the entire business this. So... Yeah. So that's... I i apologize for.

Client 2: I'm missing that I was gonna ask for you head up the team No problem From myself, I actually for side, Actually be...

Client 7: I mean, transition project managers are working with the entire team. While I'm actually are leading the customer success group within free group. So we are helping our customers from communicating all the tech development.

Client 2: So So basically, that's the background.

Client 2: Okay. And and sorry, just for Enrique. So Enrique you're coming on with logo. You you come join from the trade title or access like onto to connect yeah.

Client 6: I I'm the Con s. Will?

Client 2: So would you be the key person interacting with the airlines And Yep.

Client 2: Having the airline contracts and management surveillance.

Client 6: Obviously, I will these all the attracting all the stuff, but we will have be a supplier management team on both very soon. So... Yeah. So... But that... Yeah. Yeah. I I I I will also see or or the or the contract itself.

Client 2: Okay. Perfect. So I was gonna break up the presentation into three parts. One I was gonna talk about airline contracts which I think is a key element to, you know, what connects does and how we can help you of focus on maximizing your margins and making sure you hit your targets in see your revenue income from Airline contracts. The second problem was, how can we quickly get more income coming through from the As side air revenue side using our solution, And then the ability for you to have the index sort of feel whatever you want very quickly the speed and access through our solution. So these were the three things I was gonna focus on But if you feel there it's any the else that I should really be talking about or something in did that you guys wanna sort of look at then let me know. Yeah. Is that a case for me to sort of focus on these three and kicking off.

Client 6: Yep. Sounds good. Thank you.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. So I'll I'll share my screen will very quickly in terms of what what happened with Con we had a long term relationship with Kin panel. I think we... Connected in customers of asked for several years now. And obviously they pre dynamic customers and they continue to we, of course been completely in travel men with the same in challenges, but because our solution and our relationship with our customers having for a long term, they start with us and supported us some very grateful to the nest before was sticking by with us, and we've come through in we sort now looking at the growth coming through from this year and and in next year. I'll be that the connectors of couple of times before pandemic. But I haven't really proud to he's for couple years now. As I think most of us have been stuck. But I look forward to sort of traveling again from next year. So let me start with the system before I go into the system, the first thing I wanted this sort focus was on on what what value you can derive from them. So I wanna focus on for example, the biggest set of income generator from the s which is the airline incentives. How do we deal with that? So when we talk about Airline incentives is goes from Hong Kong you have Cath Pacific, which is the big, you know, carry home carrier. But with your other... I'm forming a big busy several international airlines competing and show China is a big much which I is gonna hold an employees opening absolutely, but over the next few months as you see the traffic volumes with buildings so I mean, Europe's open in the Us is open. So as the volume been, there are three main things. One is what airline and contracts you have in place. Right? How can you make sure that those airline contracts car gonna achieve the best level of outcome for you in terms of you not missing those revenue figures making sure you hit the incentive tiers, which airlines do you not have contracts with so you can go back and contract with those carriers. And then how about the ability to shift margins back you have some technical products to making sure that you preference certain carriers and make sure you get more income out of it So everything every aspect of our solution has been built around maximizing margins for for C's and and travel agencies we not you very very well. We understand this speak. So the first thing we did was focus on how k airlines measure the revenue and the challenge that comes And If there eight month airline background here. Bear me for two, and just quickly summing up. I think Enrique, you can help me i'm getting too much into the depth of it. But one of the big challenges everybody has is that airlines usually use they call slow revenue to measure performance from the from the T. Right? So with the phone revenue, you might issue a ticket for two thousand dollars that is issued, let's say in in July, the travel happens Hold done in September return in October, and then the reading is counted for pro values in september and the return. You have ticket values in your financial systems. But that doesn't equate to how airlines measure flow revenue and how they actually look at your performance on incentive side. The other challenges that? Is if you have called shared flights, for example, you know, if you had Single payer airlines, lu terms and single singapore airlines, hands off the passenger to Lu and Frankfurt who carries on to New york and lu influenza, Again, the revenue is reduced from single singapore airlines because they will only measure the passengers they have carrie in that destination. So these little challenges if you can add all the complex these airlines and added to the contracts for incentives. Which make it really really challenging to track and measure exactly Right? The only challenge that you have, and everybody's in that board. Right? Is the problem about data getting reported in time. So airlines come back with the report. Let's see the better airlines at least take six weeks sometimes even more. Even though it's a monthly report, it's three to four so sometimes five, six months behind, means how do you hit your target if you have an incentive tier, that goes on from one percent to five percent, you're sitting at three percent how do you know if you've dropped to two or one? How can you maximize your five percent to get the max out of that tier agreement. Right? So those are the challenges we want to reach address in real time and our solution because we take the same source data and process that information, able to give you a very, very accurate very close to the final numbers that the report based on form, in the t that you set. So you can access it in two levels. So I'll change share one which is the reporting service that offer. We have we have a team that that actually does the services on on our customer's behalf, and I'll show you what that looks like. I'm just gonna use one airline that's always in the needs this case not necessarily for the right reasons but there is for example, Qatar is this is a this is example of what they do This is a very complex contract. So whilst ours are services team, they load all the... The whole airline and contract and they create a monthly reporting pack for all your and contracts and reported like this. So this one contract might have several multiple sub in there Now depends on the carrier depends in the market. Some are straightforward some up complex. I'm sort of using one, which is a little bit more complicated, but then just this shows you how much depth there is so just to give you me an idea, there is a quarterly contract based on, for example, the same time. Or this around the world target that they've got. These different types of destinations that may have. So what our solution does is it's able to give you information in a graphical format? So this is just a summary of what the numbers are put quarter? What are the difference of inclusions and exclusions where you have you know, Which i excluded or you, there's cardiomyopathy market carrier ticket carrier, type of Jeremy, and you can sort of see that this is sort of creating information based on those conditions only where it has exclusions or inclusions set up that you can actually track and it gives you the numbers of revenue and the estimate that is coming through based on the tier and it goes to a whole bunch of depth including you know, your cumulative revenue and every element of that contract is broken into into individual targets and these are then loaded into the system right back. So when you get this reporting back every month, And again, that's a reporting service that you can sort of choose to subscribe to them made our team will load on the contracts and send you all this information a great level of depth. Right? The other option is, of course to go in and use the system itself. So I'm gonna So of jump into the actual system and share that with you for now. Let me just Just share that. Hopefully, you guys can see my screen again. Yep. Okay. So basically, it's a cloud based system you can access it from anyway, twenty four seven you put in your team address and password and you log in, And if... I mean at the moment, you'll... You know, if you only one patients will show you one, but if you multiple locations, the system will be able to show you any point of sale location where you we should take it sick in future if you're sort of having expansion plans, you can go it and have a look at that. So this is a demo system of login. The solution gives you high level view of you know, dashboards where it sort of shows you your ticket revenue, your number of passengers, flown menu flown segments. And there's a whole bunch of you know, different menus and details they can sort of dig into here I won't go into too much step because there... This will take another R. Let me jump into something again that that let's focus on which brings you value, which is the contract module. Right? So in the contract model you can sort of set up different airline contract and choose to look at which, you know, pull out different targets and have a look at that. Now this, for example, is showing you target that is set up for c. And this this is the target levels that you said. And then Every week, we're processing the data every ticket, every coupon you see be pro And then based on the conditions of the incentive contract, it will show you the estimates. That are coming to in here. And when the airline reports to numbers, you can sort of actually flip plug that in as well. And you can see the And reported numbers as well. So the value that you can see here, is very quickly before even the airline comes back on reports so you able to have very exact accurate measurements of those airline contracts. You can add in comments and keep a history of things in here at one. And and the ability for you to you not just graphically, but also having that information on a format and you can download all that information as needed very easily from the system. So, you know, the system is preset to give you that information based on targets These are the different tier levels you can know. And the system at any point of time tells you For example, this is color coded here this line that you're sitting in that level of tea. And you can sort of see the differences that you have time and focus on way need to be every report every graph, you can sort of click this button and explore this in two weeks excel. And save that and it further you. Now before I go more debt At this point, do you have any questions? Is that too fast to stop? Any feedback?

Client 6: Just one question. So normally, how long do you refresh the data? So say, for example if we want to know that be November data then when will it be operator for you the system?

Client 2: So then... It depends on the data source. We usually using the Bs hot files. These are the... I mean, when we get the files at on a either weekly basis usually on a weekly basis, but it's between depends on the settlement cycle. Right? So we we get that between seven to forty days delay in terms of when the cycle finished in terms of.

Client 2: So we it within twenty four hours. So it's maybe seven to fourteen day delay between bigger issues.

Client 6: Okay. Okay. Yep. Thank you.

Client 2: So if we use that if we use G data, it's much faster. Just few days old. So we process every week. The information. If you add different markets, we can sort of track when that comes through.

Client 6: Alright.

Client 2: So first question I have is what is your preference? Do you that you your team load longer the contracts yourselves. And would you prefer us doing it on your behalf. What is the preference from your team?

Client 6: I think to me, of course Asap sap. It depends on how tickets it. So... Yeah. I I I... We we need to look at that things together. Maybe we can confirm later.

Client 6: Okay.

Client 2: Yep. Sure. So In... Like I, there's two options we can load it for you and keith can talk more about their or your team can and we were training videos for on the modules so they can do a self based training and they they know how to do it, and we have a support team that can help. So this is on the target side on and loading the target to very quickly pretty straightforward and easy you know, you can go in and look at different target levels, and then you you sort of have a wizard that opens up and you just keep answering questions that helps you set up that value.
