Client 2: Hi. Can you hear me?

Host 1: I can hear you. You doing?

Client 2: good. How you doing I'm good Hey.

Host 1: So do you have only fifteen minutes left then and on the chat.

Client 2: Yes, I do, but I think we can actually be quite fast. Because I kind of... have to postpone our like, discussion on on Orbit, not actually postpone upon our discussion, but give you an update on on our timeline internally.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Let me know.

Client 2: Yeah. So the thing is... So we looked at different tools at the moment, which is related to communities so One is related to buttons. One is you and one is one of our portfolio companies that are doing like It's called anyone they're more on on a call connecting people on calls end. And we will try to work with them in the first place and set up something that is related to our slack community, to connect within on calls on expert calls, and we will look at orbit in the next step. So this is what I discussed internally wanted to go for the free version first also because it's one of our portfolio companies.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. So you're looking for anyone. What are they... I've you heard of them. Obviously, they're new but they're a portfolio company, so makes sense yeah Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. They're they're super early stage. So what they do basically is... So you offer your expertise on the anyone community, so you sign up. Put in whatever you're an expert put in, and then you offer a different kinds of interactions. One is, like offering a time of an hour where people can just dial in with you for five minutes. Another one is, like community calls and little bit like club. But more as a call then as a as a podcast to to access. And last one is I think something around, like, you offer basically like, sit for your expert sessions.

Host 1: Nice. It looks cool. I'm there... They have a nice Url as well. Yeah. So that's that's cool. Okay. So you're gonna you're gonna use them to start off.

Client 2: Sorry. Just a second. Okay. Sorry. I just to pay our feeling medical. Yeah.

Host 1: So... Yeah, You're gonna start off with them But orbit is still something that you all want to take steps sign. What is your time i'm looking like? And and what do you see as the biggest concerns for finalizing something with Orbit, So the thing is as you can imagine, we don't want over tools stack ourselves.

Client 2: So we will try to So working with anyone is something we actually to set up with them. So they're super early stage. They don't have a product fully fledged that fits our needs. We will try to kind of iterate with them a little bit. I guess that will take place in January. And we will see which sense we can... try to implement whatever we want to do with you. Which is more like using that for offline interactions as well. With anyone and if we cannot do it or if we see that the product development together with them is to I'd say just takes up too much time. We would definitely go for orbit. So the other event thing is is out, I'd say Bios gonna have. Okay So this is the honest feedback what I can give you Yeah.

Host 1: Appreciate it. Full transparency always a good way to go. Is is orbit if anyone doesn't work out then orbit or no matter what orbit is on the table in addition to anyone.

Client 2: That depends on what we can develop together with anyone.

Host 1: Okay So what makes sense from here as as a next step, should I so we, like, re regroup in January, like, what what makes sense for us.

Client 2: I think what would make most sense is to set up a call, maybe in... I mean, depends on a little bit, like, think I will know the third week of January.

Client 2: So first week will be getting back to work and discussing with David, second week is our off site. And then the week from the sixteenth to the twentieth. I will know And I mean, in general, I mean, if you're interested in no matter what the result is to to discuss.

Client 2: Could just set up a call. Otherwise, I can also give you written feedback Yeah.

Host 1: Know. I'd I'd love to set up a call no matter what to see, you know, was going with anyone and and where, like, the the pros and cons we just put something intent in the calendar then?

Client 2: Yeah. Perfect that would be amazing You wanna say, like, Monday, Tuesday, sixteenth or the seventeenth.

Client 2: Yes. The seventeenth is a little bit No. It's not packed. But I'm free between ten and two pm And Monday is more flexible I can do the afternoon. For example Let's see here.

Host 1: So let's say she said, what in the afternoon on Monday? Like, how late on Monday in there? Yeah.

Client 2: Open open end whatever works for you.

Host 1: Was say, four four four thirty Pm on Monday.

Client 2: Yes. Perfect.

Host 1: Alright. So that'll be let's say four thirty if that works.

Client 2: Yep.

Host 1: Alright. I'll put in there. Nice. Okay. And then... Yeah, anything else that comes up you know, just let me know. Is there anything, you know, if that works out with anyone that doesn't work out with them, is it where Okay. You're ready to move forward with Orbit, or are there any other standing items or questions that you have.

Client 2: No. The thing is, I think you mentioned that in the beginning of the year, you will have a new, like, being able to engage in the and the tool without actually being on that already. I would course then do that. Would like to do that as well.

Host 1: Yes, certainly. Let me also just check that you're in the in the system. So you wanna be included in the community and you are. So you should receive our next engagement in January, they opt in.

Client 2: If you don't okay i don't know if you don't.

Host 1: But it looks like you will. Something comes up or you don't get in January. We'll connect on the sixteenth i'll make sure that you're somehow in there.

Client 2: Okay. Is that is there a date for when it's going to start? So I No if I'm missing it, That's a really good question.

Host 1: Let me confirm that with our Cs team because they send that out there, and then I'll just I'll just send you the date to make sure that if for some reason I receive it, that it comes up in your you'll be included.

Client 2: Yep Okay.

Host 1: I think Anthem is in there a couple other Eu based Dc. So might be, you know, I'll get that day for you Yeah.

Client 2: And I was actually discussing with... I don't know. Who was it? I yeah. It was Ms msn. And they don't use you yet, but they said if they weren't that's small, they would love to partner up with you. So I'm still very much convinced of the product. That's not issue. It's just Okay.

Host 1: Alright. Well, good luck with anyone anyway. I mean, as a portfolio company. I I'm sure you're rooting for their success. So, you know, either way, looking forward to chatting with from.

Client 2: If we don't use them will.

Host 1: Right. Right. Yeah well... Hey. Maybe there's also, you know, chances as they develop the product that it makes sense to use both or something or this will makes sense for you all they developed their own thing, but Yeah. Settings to explore that either way. Okay.
