Client 2: Hey lee, How's it going?

Host 1: Dan.

Client 2: It's going here I wasn't able to get into this meeting I made a new one, but you got in just fine. So I i guess it ended up working out.

Host 1: Yeah. Weird.

Client 2: Alright. Hey where are you calling from?

Host 1: I'm in Reykjavik.

Client 2: When raise there or you transplant there?

Host 1: No. I've born raised.

Client 2: Yes, you like it enough to stay.

Host 1: I just moved back. I was I lived in California for for a small one the New york, I just came back actually last year. Was there? Lot more green up here, but, hey. You know, So you've gone coast to coast then.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Awesome. Well I'm a big believer. I I moved recently and then came home if you like where you live go live somewhere else, if you still like it go back. It'll still be there.

Host 1: Exactly. Where were you based?

Client 2: So I'm in New Jersey about fifteen minutes, twenty minutes just outside of Philly.

Host 1: Got it.

Client 2: Okay. And then I went down in North Carolina for a year city called Asheville, It was cool, not really my speed. Girlfriend and I decided to come back. She had family up here, you know, I.

Host 1: North North Carolina, I hear hear good things about North Carolina, but it wasn't... What was your your thing with it.

Client 2: Yeah. So Asheville is just this like, very There's like nobody local. Right? It's all transplant small over this town in the middle of nowhere, about four hours from Tennessee and we visited beautiful nature, awesome public parks, eighty five breweries and one town restaurants seemed like a cool place to be. So we spent a year there.

Host 1: But it just wasn't... It wasn't your thing. In the end.

Client 2: I'm in New Jersey and man. I like to move fast. I like things that stay open late. And it just the south was just much slower everything closed at a Pm yeah. So Other day was going. They spent ten minutes, you know, tell. It's like, no. No. I just know. How are you?

Client 2: What's my speed.

Host 1: Probably probably a product of the city. Right? Jersey is probably just a bit more fast space because there's more requirements to do... I mean, good feedback on North Carolina.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Bad. It was gorgeous place, lots through lots of beer if you like that, definitely a place worth it's visiting Anyway.

Client 2: Make sure I'm being respectful of your time today. You wanna dive right in?

Host 1: Yeah. What's... I I can cross your email. Just curious to learn what you have going on. Right? So let me let me know. What you need Yeah.

Client 2: So might be helpful for you if I just give you a thirty second synopsis of what is closed loop? And then we could take it from there.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: So close we work with sales leaders in individual contributors or sales training management and consulting firm, working with sales leaders and individual contributors who are concerned that maybe they're not closing as many deals as they should be look at a more whole pipeline, especially as the economy contract a little bit and they're looking to up level their skills or systems in place to hit revenue goals more repeatedly and predictably. With that in mind, and and based on what I've brought you in from the email, can you help me understand a little more what it was you were hoping? We could accomplish So your email talked about.

Host 1: You work with companies to increase their Arr. So that certainly would be at interest. So Yeah. I I'm an a pretty much leading styles and strategies stuff like that for twelve person startup. It's a bit more of an enterprise sales Arr are our biggest thing. So do know anything we can to to increase it is see... What exactly you all are are doing that could potentially help us out Yeah.

Client 2: When you say leading sales, are you... Do you have a team below you? Or you the the loan seller?

Host 1: It's it's mean the Ceo right now. That are that are doing sales.

Client 2: And did the Ceo to ask you to find something for both of you Or did you did you just reach out for yourself?

Host 1: I just reached out to to get some information Okay.

Client 2: Well then let's just focus on you for today, And if this is something you think may be relevant to bring it's her. Right?

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: That's right. Bring her in the future, I'll let you make back all.

Client 2: So Look, obviously, no big decisions to make today. Typically coming out of this when we talk to an individual contributor, if they like the types of things we do and maybe it looks like there's an opportunity to work together. One the first step is we we offer a sales assessment. Beginning of the year, I'd love to help you get some momentum. I'm happy to sort comp that to you. We usually charge a little bit for it. But what the sales of Assessment does is it gives a read out of where your skills are across nine different categories. Based on the hundreds, thousands of folks we've trained in the past. And then coming out of that we could say, hey look, So one or two minor things you gotta adjust could read one or two books and fix this yourself or if there are some other areas that could be impacted. Could reflect maybe how we could help with that as well. You might have we park five minutes the end. Decide if that's something that you wanna do.

Host 1: Sure.

Client 2: Okay. So you mentioned a more enterprise sales affecting Arr. Usually, when I hear that, from a sales rep. They're concerned with long deal cycles and losing momentum throughout. Is that something that you're seeing?

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I think that's something that everybody sees with a certain percentage of their pipeline. Right? So if I can convert, more of my pipeline in the closed deals, you know, ideal scenario.

Client 2: Okay. Is is there a particular stage where things tend to fall out of the pipeline more than others?

Host 1: Give me an example of a stage.

Client 2: So initial discovery call. Demo proposal review, legal or you implementation, final closing I think it I think it operates in the basic funnel.

Host 1: Right? I mean, less people make it to the final stages. So if I can increase the amount of people that want to get to proposal after a demo. And then the second part is, if I can get you know, more people to sign an agreement after they have in a proposal. Those to be the two biggest windows, I think we could improve conversion.

Client 2: Okay. So late late stages Yeah.

Client 2: Alright. And you mentioned a more enterprise sale. About how long is the sales cycle?

Host 1: Right now we're sixty days.

Client 2: Sixty days?

Host 1: Yeah. In in late stage and current prospects is definitely good for conversion. You know, top of funnel all also be good if we get more call set up that be that's probably best way to go to land more deals right now by keeping conversions same and then getting improve conversions later on, that would be another thing. So I don't know if you guys do top of funnel as well. In addition to converting pipeline.

Client 2: Absolutely. We just work with the company they wrapped up their training in October. They went from booking about four meetings a month They booked four meetings in the month of September, and they booked thirty five meetings in the ten weeks following training. So Are you doing all the top of funnel, the prospecting full cycle selling everything.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Okay. Yep. Yep. Alright. So what is your what is your prospecting day to day or your prospecting system look like right now?

Host 1: Right now You know, we have sequences can add a hundred prospects today. That's typically what I like to do. Hundred prospects every single day. The only problem with that, It's not it's not as targeted as I wanted to be so I wanna get more I get defined a better buyer persona to shorten in the sales cycle get more second meetings quicker. So, like, I'm my first call, to set up as many second meetings with Dms as possible. Typically goes okay, but if I can get more Dms quicker, that's an ideal scenario. But Yeah. Adding in hundred prospects per day, you know, if I can keep my conversion rates my win rate the same, you know, we could it more of a a close rate for the quarter. Yeah. That's basically it. But I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of areas to improve to actually get more meetings booked.

Client 2: Yeah. And are you cold calling in conjunction with that?

Host 1: I'm not cold calling. If I do calling, it's basically the prospect set of express interest that that are ghost or something I can get them back in line. So that that does tend to work. I'm not doing any, like, direct cold calling.

Client 2: Oftentimes i hear folks aren't cold going. It's generally because they've got pipeline that they feel they don't need to. Is that what you're at?

Host 1: I mean, I think we could always add more pipeline. So I guess, no. That's not right meant.

Client 2: Okay. Is there... Is there a particular reason that you're not going?

Host 1: Time for results. I feel is not is not there.

Client 2: And about I'm sure you could probably see where I'm going with this. So I appreciate you your can and the questions. About how many, you know, about how many meetings per week or per month however you wanna to slice it are you getting from these sequences?

Host 1: About how many books meetings?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Let's quick look at that stat. So in q four, Is about three percent would convert Sorry. Three percent would convert into a meeting. So we do about three five hundred emails and a hundred and twenty booked calls in q four for me.

Client 2: Okay. Is that enough you know, based on your win percentages is a hundred and twenty booked calls enough to hit hit revenue targets?

Host 1: A hundred and twenty booked calls with our current win rate No. On a quarterly basis, no. We'd probably wanna We'd probably wanna triple that.

Client 2: Triple that. Wow. Okay. So you obviously as leading sales and sales development, And how active... Just last question, then I'll sort of share share with you a little more. How active is the Ceo in terms of prospecting and taking calls and things like that and selling She's working more referrals.

Host 1: She got she did book. Twenty k in q four. So not not tons, but she is involved enough for she's pulling in some deals and maybe some partnership deals.

Client 2: Okay. So you obviously have a ton on your plate. You it sounds like correct if from wrong, you're sort of defining the sales process as well as leading it doing full cycle. And it sounds like a good bit of marketing in there as well. A lot of that top of funnel stuff is is one part of marketing as much as it is one part selling with the sequences, And there's a lot of oftentimes speaking with folks have a lot going on. There's a lot of different levers they could potentially pull. We could do this to close late stage conversions. We could do this to keep our conversions the same, increase deal size. We could do this to increase top of funnel given our current conversion rate more Arr. What happens is when folks don't know which lever to pull, they could oftentimes change something actually working really well.

Client 2: The idea of the assessment is to find the the the easiest opportunity to impact that's gonna have the highest result. You target that first. This one thing if we fix it is gonna have the greatest result. Then we go on the next thing. And we fix this next. Is out the second greatest result. So on and so forth, without breaking what's already working today. When I say something like that, does that sort of resonate where you've got a ton of different things you can try, but not sure which one to start with.

Host 1: In terms of, like, closing tactics, whether it's...

Client 2: Well, no no, just the entire sales cycle, whether it's changing our sequences to get more leads.

Client 2: Love tactics. Creating momentum in sales cycles shortening the sales cycles.

Client 2: Right.

Host 1: Yeah.

Host 1: Increasing. I think we need neglect the most time consuming ones worm, which is sequences So we can improve our sequencing, like, tweak every single month or every single quarter, which we're not even doing. Could probably have be a pretty big impact on the amount of deals amount of meetings that booked without even increasing our prospecting. So it just gets neglected So, you know, basically, yeah.

Client 2: Well, You don't what asking. It sounds like you already know that this is a this is a big thing. You said it's a little time consuming, but what's kept you from from honing in on that sequencing then.

Host 1: I'm working on it now. Because it's a bit of a downtime after the... After the holidays, but things are trying to ramp up. I mean, My days are filled with ko. My days are filled with follow ups. My days are filled with, like, other meetings and stuff like that. So again, it's it's just time that requires me to to neglect it, I guess.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: And and we do have enough incoming in deal flow it's not like a super urgent thing, But I feel like it's gonna be coming urgent things so I need to prioritize it now.

Client 2: Got it. Are you looking at bringing on any help for yourself? Either I mean, we i'd love to bring on someone else probably not gonna happen this quarter.

Client 2: Okay. So this is this falls on your shoulders then.

Host 1: Yeah. For sure through q one.

Client 2: Okay. Well, look, what are your thoughts around if I could copy this as assessment if you could... It takes about twenty minutes, seventy questions we could we could get together later this week, and I could give you a readout of Hey, based here's what we found, here are some areas you could go and tweak maybe it is. That telephone funnel, we could talk about what we do in terms of sequencing, messaging, defining Ic a little more closely. Maybe it's something somewhere else in the sales funnel that we could target, and all of that would be geared to increasing Arr. Is that's something you'd be open to?

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, is you need... There's any downside to that besides twenty minutes?

Client 2: I need twenty minutes of your time and you to show up and chat with me again so I could share what we found.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, that that sounds like something that would be valuable.

Client 2: Okay. Sure. So what I'll do then is when we get out of here, I'll send you the link for that. What does what does your Friday look like?

Host 1: Friday should be generally okay. Afternoon maybe.

Client 2: Afternoon, I could do After three Pm eastern, that'll be after two Pm your time. Sure.

Host 1: Eastern.

Client 2: Oh, you're eastern. Okay. So we may. How we do three thirty then.

Host 1: Reykjavik is eastern in Chicago is is central. Yeah. Three thirty works.

Client 2: You're right. You're at. Well, geography was never my strong suit.

Host 1: Oh good.

Host 1: Yeah. Works, if you wanna send over calendar invite? I'll I'll try to get this done. And we can meet up then. What what's the end goal? With with closed loop. I mean, what... you know, should the assessment go rights and there's value. What's what's your next step here? What are do you what are we trying to it could be one of two things.

Client 2: If this assessment comes back, real strong, and I don't see a lot of opportunity for us to help. I'll say, hey, You were right, Tweak this one or two thing, maybe here's a book you could read to work on these one or two skills. You don't need us. The other thing and and this is typically what I'm working with an individual contributor. We have something called winter circle. Winter circle is goes either quarterly It's a leading retail where every week we meet for an hour a half we go over different selling techniques, skills, concepts, everything from top of funnel prospecting closing defining Ic p's even self coaching.

Client 2: So if you do end up hiring someone you'll be able to self coach and coach them. And that's something that allowed individual contributors have gotten a ton of value from.

Host 1: Got it. So Was there a cost to the Winter circle like a mini mastermind?

Client 2: Yeah. It is an mastermind. It's it's cost. We do either It's it's far less expensive than our big our big sales team deals. It sits at about three k for a quarter five k for half of the year. And with that, you also get access to closed Loop university which is our online knowledge base comes with all of our online courses as well.

Client 2: As you get the pair those together and get personal coaching with it.

Host 1: So if it's five k every six months, you get this mastermind group and that goes how many times for six months.

Client 2: We meet once a week for six months.

Host 1: Really Yeah.

Host 1: That in that... Does that in in addition to coaching or is that basically the coaching.

Client 2: That is the coaching But I'll let you in usually when I work with smaller companies, if there are people that request it, I'll plan like twenty, thirty minute coaching meetings outside of that where me and a few individuals will meet one on one, will meet and I'll go over active deals specific questions, things like that. My only request is if we do that, just don't tell other people in the room that I'm doing that with you. Because then everyone asks for it.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. Are you you're a sales coaching training yourself then.

Client 2: Yeah. I a full cycle exact ae just like yourself.

Host 1: Add add closed loop. So you're gonna doing a bit of both essentially. Yeah. I guess he had to be both in his Right?

Client 2: You have to. Well, think about it. Would you want someone who doesn't do teaching you out prospect.

Host 1: Yeah. Right. No. That it makes it makes sense. I mean, I I didn't know if you were also doing, like, coaching addition to, like, bring it on people for the mastermind, let's say.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. So i i I I lead when Circle what I'll do what's called Jump starr, which is like winter circle, but condensed. We do that with full team. So if you said had five aes that need training, would get you in jump star. That's something different that interesting.

Host 1: I I see sort at train you.

Client 2: Oh, I still coach for them.

Host 1: Yet.

Client 2: Right? Yeah.

Host 1: Alright. Cool how did you find it?

Client 2: I'm talking to somebody. Yeah. I actually invested... I think do you know guys and girls over.

Host 1: I know one lead trainer over there Jordan but that's it.

Client 2: Yeah. I was spoken with Jordan once your twice. Yeah. So I was an investor in it. And when I i was talking with the Ceo, he was telling me something was like, Why are you doing things that way that makes no sense? You're major really hard on yourself He was like, well, what do you mean? Doing x y and z, Why don't we do A blah blah? I invested in them, and then they were like, well, you do training, which you wanna take a little on the side and and train our cohorts. So what we do is we train them and then we give them closed loop books, so they take our marketing material and got out the door.

Host 1: Interesting. Okay. Well, you know, Yeah. Train really is interesting What you're doing sounds cool. I mean, five k for six months. It seems like there's a bit of value there. I, depending on these things typically go. Like, I I was looking for more of maybe, like a a direct sales coaching scenario. But, you know, J one Like, you you could share about how these but how does winter circle goes or like, what it is. I've done a couple of these I've done a couple of these things like on circle with like, other sales, professionals and things like that. I, you know, it's it's a bit of a lower cost I didn't I didn't stick around. So I'm just wondering Yeah. The main the big difference there. Like, you know what's the What do you mean by saying more of a...

Client 2: Just just help me out and more of a direct coaching as opposed to a mastermind because the master might come with the direct coaching built in.

Host 1: In terms it's like a group coaching. Right?

Client 2: It's group sessions. So in the ninety minute session, The first forty five minutes is teaching and building upon skills techniques, concepts, all that stuff. And then the second half is live coaching of the techniques that we just learned as well as hey, dan. I've got a deal and I'm working with this prospect who has you know, pain that we solve for and they've looped in their manager, but we're trying to figure where to get budget, you know, what do we do here and we use that as coaching opportunities?

Host 1: Yeah. So I would say that that's probably the biggest thing. Like, even if we, like, out top of funnel. All that be interesting to talk about. We talked about hey, there's five deals I have. I'm in talk to the Dm. I'm in talks with the U, You know, let's push this over the line. That that specifically what I'm looking for. So is that the type of conversations in the Circle, like, basically, late stage buying process to close deals.

Client 2: Yes. And let me show you something real quick. Just just this aids oftentimes helpful. This actually needs to be slightly updated But this is the curriculum by corner of what we're going over. So the things from establishing report, how we loop in new new contacts, new executives, the people we need in the deal. Finding pain. What are we solving for that's gonna help close the deal overcoming resistance uncovering resources early that it helps with closing later on. And then these week four sessions are actually gonna be broken off. These are gonna be self coaching ways that you can self coach, and I'm gonna have a second bi meeting for managers. So you can see the whole curriculum here. You can attend whichever sessions you think are most impactful for you?

Client 2: Not. Again the ones you don't want to, that's entirely up to you. And then come with specific questions that we can work on in these sessions or in private sessions if that's something you'd be open to. But I mean, I don't wanna put the car in front of the horse here. Look. We could do this assessment and it could come back. And then maybe one or two minor things that you need to tweak or we might discover, hey, this something that's really worth working on and here are the sessions that would work on it. I mean, What do you think about that?

Host 1: In terms of picking and choosing the sessions that would work, Is that what your is there talking about?

Client 2: I mean, doing the assessment see what we come back or deciding where to go.

Host 1: I mean, I don't I don't think there's any downside I'd just, you know, do an assessment and see, you know, this if this makes sense. Right? I mean, because when it it comes down to it. Yeah. Based on where I'm at and what we need and then, you know, we go into q one with this winter search Curriculum. Is it really gonna actually help me? I'm sure it will in a lot of ways, but I think the assessment is essentially gonna help you determine the right fit.

Client 2: Let me ask you this. What's your average deal size?

Host 1: Ten Ten okay?

Client 2: Theoretically then if this would help you close one more deal, it's already double the cost of it to begin with.

Host 1: Right. Well, if my company paying for it, Yes. I'm gonna pay for it, then it would be a lot more deals. It'd you five deals. Right?

Client 2: Be about five deals. Well, I mean, give a sixty day sales cycle we would have plenty that we could see start to finish throughout a course of a quarter or two quarters. I mean, you could do it one quarter at a time see how you feel after that.

Host 1: Yeah. Right. Okay. So you do you can do, like, on a quarterly basis.

Client 2: Yeah. I just give a little discount for folks to do two quarters.

Host 1: Okay. Cool. I know I know we're about at time here. Yeah. wanna send over the assessments, happy to take some next steps on that and that's a lot of stuff I'm looking for. You know, it's it's really the year. Glad we're able to connect on it. You're you're putting this together.

Client 2: Yeah. So just confirm three thirty Friday the sixth. These assessment will take about twenty minutes. I'll kick that over to you. The next ten fifteen minutes we'll chat.

Host 1: Okay. You want these assessment done before that meeting. Correct?

Client 2: Yeah. Because we'll meet at that meeting to do a readout show you what the results are and then peel out some of your answers and sort of give a little context. Just you know, I'm gonna be asking you questions. Because I'm gonna say, hey, you know, this is the score we got. Is this something you're doing often. Is there a reason for this? You I I still need more insight. I can't assume to know everything about you. That would form and wrong of me to deal.

Host 1: For sure. Yeah. No. That sounds good.

Client 2: Alright. Well, hey. Good connecting you man. We'll out on Friday.

Host 1: Alright. Appreciate it in. Too.
