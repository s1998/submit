Client 2: wait.

Host 1: What's Alex?

Client 2: Hey, Topper. Are you man?

Host 1: I am doing a well better, sorry. I'm late. I had to update my Zoom.

Client 2: That's that's how I get you.

Host 1: And slide every time you turn around.

Client 2: Seems got an update. Yeah. No worries. It's all good. I appreciate you jumping on. You have you got the honor of being one of my first first official demos at.

Host 1: So If nothing else, I'm gonna need your your feedback after the call for sure.

Host 1: Did you just get did you just get promoted? Or is it a new role?

Client 2: Or... I... Yeah. I I literally started here last week.

Client 2: I see Yeah we're we're a small startup movement at the speed of light as I'm sure you're familiar with over their team flow two, but No. Wendy and my last gig, I was at Catalyst and when they had reach out to me and I I saw a demo of team flow before I Catalyst is that company that I always see that dude posting from what's his name.

Client 2: One. Mark and Kevin, yeah. Kevin, Kevin is yeah There's like, a kevin Kevin Dude who is like, the Ceo, and then someone dude from, like, outreach.

Client 2: I feel like they're always crossing blue stuff like the.

Client 2: Yeah. They have walmart, I mean, mark's from from you said he's got a massive following a lot of people know, but Yeah. They're both trying to crush the social game. They're they're good deeds.

Host 1: How can we ended up leaving there?

Client 2: I think it was more about this opportunity than than anything else Mark came in as a Cro and like, he's gonna wanna do things his way anyway. I sure he's gonna wanna bring a lot of his his outreach people in. But I had one of our our Vcs, A guy named Frodo Capri work for them, and he kinda hit me up out of the balloon. And I've worked at a few of Frodo's companies he's been involved with in the past. So yeah. It's just kinda ser. Just gonna work out.

Host 1: Well, it seems like well you guys got got going on here's dope. I haven't really seen anything like it and thought about a lot of this stuff just kind of on my own time.

Host 1: Sure. So definitely curious to just learn a little bit more about what you guys have got. And, you know, to the extent that works would love to try it out.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's that's the perfect outcome. Right? Like, we have twenty four minutes here, so we're not gonna get into the the crazy nitty gritty, but I feel like A good outcome is. We do trials. So if if you when a a couple team members wanna try it out for for a month or whenever that up being you know, great. Like, we can set up success outcome criteria, and all that kind of stuff. But ultimately, yeah, like it makes sense we get you guys in a trial for sure.

Client 2: I appreciate you took a look at it. So you have an idea of what we're talking about it. Simplest way that I explain it to people as I'm trying to do this that a networking event last Thursday trying to do it. My day three is, like, six sense for social media. Everybody's familiar with six cents and intent data. But the reality is there's a world of conversations and interactions happening. On social media that standard intent data just doesn't capture.

Host 1: Well dude obviously, like, I I've never really under understood why Well, maybe I... Maybe it's because they're selling more, like, enterprise type people, but yeah. I've I've always thought at least, especially since, like the emergence of Linkedin, that, like, social intent is the best indicator of anyone buying something. I don't know it feels like the data that six senses is putting together is just like they're they're taking a lot of guesses whereas it feels like people are of actively talking about things on social media and if you can touch someone at the right time their buyers or any based they're posting about. Like, it seems like a way better route to accomplishing the same thing.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. And then that's that's a good way to put it. And I think part of it too is, like, in some with some of the large organizations like our hunch is, hey, if you already have six cents, layering on top something like t. To say, we know these are the companies that are potentially visiting us. Okay. Let's see what's actually going on conversational, i'm linkedin Right.

Client 2: And that's the trend i get.

Host 1: It's... So with six cents, I mean, maybe you know a little bit more about than I do, but, like, they I don't know. It feels like they're looking at do i even like describe. Like, I know they look at, like, web visitors and then you kinda... But you kinda have to, like, upload your target accounts in a six, and then it tracks it from there. And and it feels like it's not finding anything that you're not already thinking about. If that makes sense, like, I I don't know.

Host 1: That's the best way that I can explain it. But I feel like with this type of thing if it does, What I think it does, it's like you know, finding finding intent without having to, like, know where might exist first. I don't know.

Host 1: Anyways, yeah No.

Client 2: It's fine. No. This is this is great. No. I appreciate you. Participating that just let me pitch at. It's like the breakdown that I kinda make is, like, I'm gonna talk to people who know what their Tam is. They haven't it really identified and they want some ammo to go after that. Trend is great for that. The flip side of that, the other bucket is Hey. Our tam could apply to any number of folks. Anyone with a remote sales team. Right, Sdr team. That's us. That's wide how do we narrow down that whiteness to find people who are actively talking about things that we can solve for. So that's the other piece that rendered does really well. And I think that's probably what you're kind of alluding to is is like, hey. This does apply to so many things. How we actually find and participate in active conversations.

Client 2: Krishna.

Host 1: So care you.

Host 1: No do thing. I'm just super curious to learn a little bit more about, like, what what socials are you guys looking at?

Client 2: Like, so we actually like, is it like, a keyword type of thing where we're, like, just fine people or like, saying these things.

Host 1: That's just kinda what I'm curious a bit more about.

Client 2: Yeah Yeah. So I'll I'll jump into this because I hate when people say demos and they don't actually show anything. Go here. So this is kinda what trend looks like. It's pretty simple to use. I'd like I've been in here for the past week and a half, and I've already done a bunch of stuff.

Host 1: Getting still work for me.

Client 2: Oh no way.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Oh, no. I didn't I looked into like, oh, let's say like the a cool post. I'm like, oh, there you go. Yeah. So you're on the money. Right? Like, there's a couple of ways that we can monitor and kind of listen to the world of social media. Doing that across linkedin, across Twitter across Instagram across Tiktok right now. Those the four. That we're plugging into we're scraping public information. Right? So we're not going into your Topper your twitter feed to look at, like, all the stuff that you're posting to see all of your connections whatever. We're just purely looking at what's available to scroll through on Linkedin, Twitter, etcetera. That's the first thing. Right? So there's no terms of service issues or anything like that. It's all public contact. Fine. Keyword search. That's what I did here in this Sdr prospecting test. And what I did in this remote test was Right. I'm just gonna plug in remote remote work and see what comes out.

Host 1: Has mostly Okay. Got it. That... So that's what I'm wondering, like, do keywords hashtags.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. That's... Yeah. That's the big thing because not everyone. Hashtags.

Host 1: And even something that might not be relevant to, like the content and the post that you're selling into.

Host 1: Okay. Yep. Yeah. Makes sense.

Client 2: So the idea here is, like, I would be able to set these surges up. We call them topic channels. And that'll be important later when I talked to you about how we like, price things and how this all works, but essentially, topic channels are searches based on criteria So I'm gonna set one up for remote work. I find that. Hey, maybe this is seeing a lot of stuff that isn't super relevant? Well, now I'm gonna exclude some stuff. I'm gonna suppress all the stuff that doesn't really fit what I'm looking for. And you can tailor it that way. But even just scrolling some of this to your point, like, queuing into conversations that are happening you might not know about great. Like this is that use case this is looking across all of those different social media networks to see what fits with what you're looking for. I'm like, I might scroll across this, and I see i'll fig my like they weren't really on my radar, but I know now that they have a remote team of account execs i'm gonna target them. I might actually look at their job posting and see like, is there anything in here I can it's gonna bold too. It's not just directional which account, but also what is some ammo that I could use to possibly crack into this account, to make it relevant.

Client 2: Cool.

Host 1: Yeah. This is great. So this is normally how it looks. Right? Like, you create a you create a channel that's basically pulling in post based on keywords and things like that, and then you can just scroll through a feed posts that are relevant based on the keywords or how that you enter?

Client 2: And then you can basically... I mean the search shows and then...

Host 1: Yeah. Then and but then from there, you kinda like you're like, okay, this a good lead. Now I'm gonna go, you know, kinda download this lead from, like, linkedin or Zoom info or wherever you can find an put it into a cadence or is there something you guys do here to help with, like, contact data information, that kind of thing.

Client 2: Yeah. We're we're working on that kind of stuff, like the the connectivity between tools. That's kinda like the next year to drop is like our Salesforce integration and all those things.

Client 2: For now, the way the priority forgot. I guess you could say it us is like, we can do things like Csv import So if you had a list of the contacts that you specifically wanted to monitor super that.

Host 1: Yeah. It's that's super important. I I was just curious, like, what's maybe I haven't down the pipe. I could see it being valuable, but, like, you know, just for sure it's gonna be something we tackle in the very future.

Host 1: Just the idea of, like, being able to find hot leads based on keywords and things it's a good start. I think it's a good wedge.

Host 1: Yeah, no. I think the data component makes sense at at some point. Yeah. This is cool. So What else you have to show me?

Client 2: Yeah. I mean, this is basically how it works. Right? Like, all I did is click new search. Can add a bunch of search terms in here. Now this is just keyword. Right? You can some hashtags if you want. Run that search, It's going to run for know, an hour a couple hours few hours maybe a day depending on how complex it is. And then it'll shoot out these results just like this. I think the the cool part too is, like, and I was about to post... I'm not a big linkedin poster, but I'm about start about today. Like doing social selling, Like, I don't know to what extent you guys social cell, by any definition today. But being able to just quickly come in here and interact with post two.

Host 1: Like hey no from.

Client 2: Okay. That's fine Anthony. Maybe left on good terms.

Host 1: That we're good.

Client 2: Version.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: Maybe I come in here and I'm like, great.

Host 1: Now.

Host 1: We actually encourage the anthony to post something the no east we're we're big on social selling.

Host 1: So I think that's why this resonates with me. So the... What are the issues that I might imagine it's like, it seems like, you know, the people that you're pulling in here are probably people that very vocal on linkedin, but, like, what percentage of people are really that vocal about buying things across different social media like do you ever personally or have you run into the issue yet of like, trying to you know, kind of create a a new search or a campaign that's started like keywords and like you're just not a lot there.

Client 2: Yeah. Occasionally. For sure. I mean, it depends on what your obviously what your search criteria are. But What I would say is the reason that I was excited to talk to you all is because I feel like the topics that are important to you are very prevalent. On Linkedin, and it's not just like I want to buy a remote Salesforce, like I different a virtual sales tool. What can you guys recommend? Like, that's not... You're not gonna get those gift wrapped obviously. It's like, hey, I have this opinion on remote work. I think it's great. I there the challenges like great. Yeah. Like, totally debt where were coming from. Here's what we've seen on the team floor.

Client 2: Yeah. How you're building that social cloud. Right? So like, Yes. If you do it too specifically, if you're using two few criteria whatever it is, yeah. You're run into that occasionally, but that's kinda where I think. Mh. In my mind would be kind of a good partner for us because there is a privacy for those types of conversations.

Host 1: And good for you for thinking about that And because I I that I think will make her break you're Gt motion here. Just like finding companies that are selling things that are talked about I think the the flip side too is, like, was like a ton of devops ops conversations going on on Tiktok.

Client 2: But i would have no idea that that would ever be the case, but like we ran some tests and it's true.

Client 2: Right? So there's also that element of we don't know we don't know.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah yeah. Without it doubt. Cool. Well, I I like it, man. I love said play around with it. And I know you reached out to Lend first. Basically would just like to, you know, be able to use this with her.

Host 1: Sure. I don't know what your guys standard trial period is, but At least just like enough time to build some campaigns or lists mess out of some keywords, see what the volume looks like. Try reaching out to some people with the context, see how effective the response rates are compared to what we're doing right now and try to, you know, create some kind of business case to do easy say because I could I could totally see the value. It's just a matter of you know, digging in and then try it out a little bit.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. Totally. So let's do this if I can make a suggestion, Let me set you all up with a trial. You'll get a handful of topic channels. That's how we're that's how we're priced. Like, that's how we operate is the number of those independent searches that you wanna run And is that based on, like, Like, is it just like a fixed price for each or is it based on, like, Api calls from, like, pulling in certain post and information are like, what what exactly how exactly work just spend bundles of number of topic channels that you want.

Client 2: And so like suppose that...

Host 1: I I mean, there's probably tiers, but, like, starting out for channel like, what does that cost?

Client 2: We started like, twenty bucks a topic channel. like the baseline you get the the baseline what we're working with is you'd get twenty topic channels, that would be forty eight hundred bucks for the year.

Host 1: Got it. Okay.

Client 2: That's unlimited users. So can get everybody in there who wants to be a user, you can share topic channels with each other and all that.

Host 1: It's not like...

Host 1: And twenty topic channels is your minimum now. Am i understanding that correctly.

Client 2: That's the floor for now. Yep.

Host 1: I could see a world where we may only want, like, five to ten because our our Ic is, like, so refined at this point.

Client 2: Yeah. And let's let's talk about that. Right? Like, we're where we're open to discuss Santa I'm not gonna make any promises on this call, but Yeah.

Host 1: No.

Client 2: For sure.

Host 1: So i good definitely talk her.

Host 1: Figure out what I need. On the trial and let, you know. How you guys been around by the way. I know you guys are pretty new, but just curious.

Client 2: Yeah. Couple of years. Right? Like, we spent the last couple.

Client 2: We've actually been selling it. For probably maybe since like last the how month is it? December? Over the summer, they really ramped up. Like, I'm the first salesperson they've had and hired We had kind of a P motion that we're running for a little bit and now they wanna get aggressive and get me in here and to start sling in software.

Host 1: So you're like the the founding ae kinda.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Yep. Right.

Client 2: I Yeah.

Host 1: Was...

Client 2: And there's an Sdr manager for a while. So kind.

Client 2: What about one of the Ic that we wanna tackle I.

Host 1: So. Well, that's that's exciting. I'm sure To go well for you guys. It's definitely an interesting concept. And where where you you based up?

Client 2: We're all over. There's a few of us. Most of us are in new England. I'm in in Massachusetts, our Ceo's, Massachusetts or head of products in new Hampshire. So then we we're kinda dispersed after that.

Host 1: Yeah. And do you know, do you know how many customers you guys have, like, today?

Client 2: That's a good question. I actually don't know offhand. But I can find out a number. If that's interesting to you. Some might probably no holds.

Host 1: Got. It's all good.

Client 2: I know you do.

Host 1: Cool. Well, I think that's Most of the questions that I have yeah. If you could just help me get set up with some kind of trial, I think think it's yeah.

Client 2: Pretty easy.

Host 1: So can hit you what as they come, but think it should be pretty sure.

Client 2: I wanna do that. My my other suggestion was like, we can I can get my head of product on a call too. If you wanna like, hammer it out together for thirty minutes and just make sure the channels are set up the right way. Or if you guys have ideas better yet and you wanna send me a list of words and everything else we can get that set out.

Client 2: Totally up to you.

Host 1: I think I might just take a stab, like, I have some extra time early this week to play around with this little bit.

Host 1: So probably just, like try and build some stuff, but I I'm sure I'll have a lot of questions. So I might just hit you like, over email with those or if you don't mind, like, assign together for maybe fifteen minutes or so if I have a bunch of them I think i'll probably be the most like, efficient way to go about it.

Client 2: Yeah. That's that's cool with me.

Host 1: And sorry. I one more time. How long will we what we have to play around with the...

Client 2: thirty day trial.

Host 1: Cool.

Client 2: Yep. Cool so thirty days from when I get that so probably later today. I'll be able to fire off the going to your right after call.

Host 1: Wanna shoot myself in the foot with this. But when I started at team flow, we had a thirty day trial and I ended that shrinking it to seven because people drag their feet a lot.

Client 2: I know well, that's I was gonna happen.

Host 1: Simplicity. So no. Like, Yeah. I really appreciate... Don't don't do of me, but Now I'm I'll be able to, like, figure out within a couple weeks, but like, when you offer a really long trial, people tend to drag their feet at first and they feel like they have forever and they don't really do like anything. The more you can shorten the trial, especially like with the level of simplicity of your product. Like, you you realize value quickly. Right? Like, color gonna like, few days.

Host 1: I'm gonna be like, oh, and I could get in touch with someone that I, like fine through your thing. And that to me is like like, immediate success. So I don't know I feel like people can do that within a few days. I would consider sorting or trial a lot. I think, like, when you're doing things from a P g standpoint, you wanna, like, feel like people have enough time to, like, figure things out and try it out, but the reality like, thirty days is just too much time for anyone to, like, you know, try anything out it's gonna take, like, a few days especially with the nature of your product. I think it's like pretty straightforward and need easy to understand. So I don't know just... This is from my my own experience.

Host 1: Yeah. Similar.

Host 1: Yeah. No. But I like the simple the simple price great.

Host 1: And the flexibility. Definitely need a trial because it's new, but, yeah, Just consider sorting get. Once we did that, we saw i I think we reduce our sales cycle from, like ninety days to, like, twenty.

Client 2: And oh wow.

Host 1: And we... Our conversion rates went up significantly. And And we're obviously a lot more hands on. Right? Like, we weren't just like, people them to a product. And if you if you're just putting people into the product, like, I haven't logged it on my own and tried it out but more content you can deliver people from, like, an an app onboarding experience, make life a lot easier from a salesperson because then you're just, like, picking out hot leads and not having to, like educate everyone.

Host 1: But again, your product is, like, pretty straightforward. So the and fees probably isn't huge ours is it was like, a lot more challenging because it's, like it started out as a really complex product that we've like slim it down a lot. Kinda simplifying things. But yeah. Just, you know, device from my own experience.

Client 2: Yeah. No. No. I I agree with you. And and I think part of part of me is like, all people just be able to see this and just buy it, Like we're not not like, it's not your website six cents and all that.

Client 2: But Yeah Wait.

Host 1: What is your website again trend out? What ai Is it t n t e n d e r d.

Host 1: Was Okay.

Client 2: So now just the R person.

Host 1: That's cool. Good for you. Okay. Where if I sign up, what is it like we do If you sign it...

Client 2: Yeah, you can you can sign up right from there if you wanna.

Host 1: Trying. Yep. Oh, I was just like i your sign up for. Because, like, we also learned a lot about sign up flows when we first started to We basically... So i it doesn't matter. I'll just give you my anecdote. We started out with, like, thirty day trial like we said, and people could sign up with only their, like, you know, Gmail, accounts and no other, like information about their company their role etcetera. A lot of it... Maybe it was our products. Like, maybe don't take my advice here, but a lot of those people like dead, immediately, and I can never get in touch with them we ended up like, p a lot of shit and saying, like, you have to talk to sales before you like get into the product.

Host 1: Again, I don't know like, if your guys product is converting on its own already, but if it's not maybe beef up to sign up a little bit.

Client 2: I don't know. Where where... Yep. And that's the exact thing that we're talking about internally right now. That's that's the the direction we're going because we were kinda hitting that same dead end of none of these people are talking to us after they That's we're...

Client 2: Yeah. It's the same thing yeah when Yeah.

Host 1: It's it was tough. I was, like, my first, like, sixty days that team flow just like emailing people's gmail and not getting any response. I was like fuck this dude like the first day that I came in I was like joining the trial we're we're making our end app onboarding experience better and we're asking for more information and my Ceo was like, no.

Host 1: Like, we can't lose leads, like these people can be customers. I'm like, no one's fucking converting dude I gotta my had on for, like, forty.

Host 1: So You can you can tell your leadership that if they don't wanna but as.

Host 1: It was night and they do, like i'm I'm telling you like, luckily we who are serious and actually wanna buy are going to submit their information no matter what...

Host 1: That's all you need for know.

Client 2: Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Now they're... I'm it's validating else that we're already starting.

Host 1: Like me I'm not awesome.

Host 1: I'm not someone that would have flinch if you ask for multiple pieces of information for me. Right? Because Like, I actually want to use potentially by the product. Everyone else is just trying to get information or researching things. I don't know I don't know. I feel very strongly about this kind of stuff. But what you.

Client 2: I I'm gonna glad we're in our head in the the right direction. Because it is all the challenges that where ran into like, a couple months ago before I started i first started talking to them chat. No makes all sense.

Client 2: That did All I was gonna say is, like, let's if you're cool putting something on the calendar like, a week and a half, like, maybe end next week, so you've had chance play with it. We can just read reconnect before it gets This this the last month of yours? Month or, like are you quarterly monthly are you guys gonna be?

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: You busy this honest?

Host 1: This is our end of quarter and my holidays are kinda fucked.

Host 1: So We can meet back up on, like, the sixteen... Fifteen or sixteenth, no. Like maybe around this time.

Host 1: Yeah.

Host 1: We can adjust. All accept it if it works if not, we can move it. But that sounds good me I think two weeks will be like good for us to dig in if I have questions before then I'll reach out to you.

Host 1: And sorry last thing. Should I just like sign up on the website to have Wendy sign up herself too basically, like, have your own accounts, but you can share topic channels with each other.

Host 1: How can you guys don't have, like, a continue with Google option.

Client 2: We we I believe are working on it.

Client 2: Right...

Host 1: Yeah. I I think that be better than facing what's in the hopper too.

Host 1: Just because my Facebook email is, like, my a messenger email that I created when i was ten I had don't anymore.

Client 2: It's... We actually had Facebook as one of think we did in the early days. We had Facebook as one of our social media that were were monitoring, but their their whole algorithm and everything is.

Client 2: You get some possible.

Client 2: It's impossible to get I think that's like I that is that we still have that as in a login option.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. For sure. I appreciate the conversation. Will I'll send you some instructions just so like, you know, what the deal is, you have my contact info, but Yeah. We'll sync up late next week.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. But that that, Brother. I appreciate you. We'll talk soon.

Client 2: Right.

Host 1:
