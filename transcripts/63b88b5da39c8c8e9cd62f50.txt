Host 2: Is that you? It's not book that app, your video meeting companion. With Ai and automations. Is that you?

Host 2: No No. No. No. No. It's called spoke dot app. If you look like it is missing.

Client 3: Never heard of it.

Host 2: Yeah Yeah. Alright. Well, since that's for taking the the time when are you cutting from?

Client 3: Southern California.

Host 2: Great. Awesome. How long have you been with best Ever?

Client 3: Oh, goodness. Gosh. I don't even know. July, I think So six months? Six months seven a month.

Host 2: Pretty sure.

Host 2: Congratulations I'm learning it's a great company and and po that is an amazing business. It's she's one of my closest friend. I think I think I think you're in good company.

Client 3: Yes. No. I enjoy her. We have a great team.

Host 2: Yes. Absolutely. Great. Well, Meta is fatima team on the all side, That you build also great team. Zac Enrique cutting also from southern California and from Canada, and right now, I am calling on Europe. But I'm usually basing my mostly So the context contextual for this conversation is we are starting to work on the new products that's called a Cell ai it's a conversational intelligence team that helps sales teams close more deals. Basically by helping you improve your sales I coach them and making can show that they pitching the right way and and insulin and so forth. Before I I kick it up and and show you what we're working on the left to hear all about hu, Can you walk me through? When did you do at best And what's the curing size the go to market and sales team best ever.

Client 3: So I do all the sales lead generation for our best So like, we I ten trade shows with a por, and then I handle all of the sales follow up in a Crm system. We're using Pipe drive right now. And basically, just communication with the clients from the time that they become a qualified lead all the way until they become a customer. So... And then as far as our team, I think there's five or six people onboard revenue generation is very very small. We've kind of pivoted on the product. We were doing more U But before and I have discovered that there's need more a bigger need for Amazon videos to be used on the Amazon site either on the listing or as a sponsored ad. Amazon's really strict about their content, So we're just trying to capitalize on that and get that right.

Host 2: Yep. That's it's funny. I'm I'm I'm quite I with best of bills Journey. And that's one thing I appreciate with the values actually is able to, like, sing on her feet and change direction is building actually quite quite quickly. So I I know that it's a... We're making, like, pretty big changes in directions all sales right now. I know that it's always fun in the team to to to to to have these changes. It can be a bit destabilizing stabilizing. I think it's the right thing to do as a spell. I. I I appreciate it there's little. So did you you said the team of, like, five zero six What what is that composed? Like how how many aes or old deals do do you have right now?

Client 3: So I'm the only salesperson person, instead up por. And then Julia does all of the leads for the content generation. So she contacts if we're using New, you know, reviews. She sends all the product to the review where she kinda coordinates all that. And then the rest is the engineers. Engineering the app, engineering the Ai, creating helping create the content with the Ai if that's in fact what they want because the U videos are obviously very straightforward. It's a review by one of our creators, whereas the Ai content for Amazon basically goes and scrape the Url. And it comes back and put together a video, and then we have videographer that will work and design the the video. So I think there's one graphic designer video designer and then the rest is engineers.

Host 2: Got it.

Host 2: Okay. So in this case, then love for you to tell me whether you feel like there is still a fit with what we're working on because Okay.

Host 2: Sure. Let me show you what working on. Can you see my screen?

Client 3: Yep.

Host 2: So There you go. So this is this is Cell Ai. So the way it works is that you sign up and then you connect your Crm, we don't support pipe drive yet now we only need to support salesforce and soon have hubspot. You connect calendar so that we can join in your meetings. We have our own assistant instead joining your meetings. And then the way it works is that you can... You we record all of your sales calls And we send them to your team. We expose them to your team. Right? So here, you can see for example, these all the the calls that made him has been having. And I can I can watch the recording of these calls so for, there is this call right here. Can what's the recording can watch the summary, the transcript so we generates this Ai generated summary here. We expose a few different metrics to help you become a better sales built How much time you spend duck how much time you wait before speaking tell the the the the the person is done talking. Do you wanna log a right now I've kind of for example that's pretty bad.

Host 2: And then when you when your team is is is posting their calls, you can actually post comments here. So suppose to, like, receive an objection about pricing. You can be like, a like Hey, you see is the right way to handle this objection let's test.

Host 2: Right? And as you boost this, that your team can then reply and have conversations about it and stalling so so we to be able to, like, bring together. Snippets library of, like, best in practices like, hey, like, everybody do this do that. Like these all like, examples of right ways to handle the objections and. Again, you know, typically, it's more used to by teams for coaching the teams, it can be used by your yourself for self coaching as well for like reviewing your calls and for... Info like, looking at the conversation metrics and so forth. But I I would understand if, you know, having no greedy team right now speak up, We understand if you start it wouldn't didn't be fit for you.

Client 3: Right? Because it's just important I right now on the calls.

Host 2: Yeah.

Client 3: But I could see down the line. Absolutely. This would be great technology.

Host 2: Yep. I'm happy to you right now. We're not solving for just yet. I yeah. I wouldn't tell you for given the size of your team. So I'm happy to bother you now and and get your feedback with About. But, yeah, I think I think our target is going to be able to slightly be a bigger end.

Client 3: Definitely.

Host 2: Great. So Okay. So then let me send you the link in the chat. Can you share your screen and I'll send you the link to board right here.

Client 3: Me when you can see it.

Host 2: I can see it Okay. So this is like you can continue.

Client 3: I can hit continue.

Host 2: Yeah. Yeah. You can continue yeah. This is the stage where I could connect Calendar deals, like, we can see the Zoom links and join your meetings. Yeah. You click on advanced What do you want me to click on next?

Host 2: Oh, sorry. Click on the go to That's safe. It's actually really I'd unsafe is Google. Like in process of being approved to by Google.

Client 3: Know otherwise my Internet is like super slow.

Host 2: I don't know.

Host 2: Sorry. Yeah. You can click on I'll do this data. We don't support you'll Crm right now. You can connect your Slack so that we can notify you when comments or proceed on your things and stuff that You can click on I'll do this later if you never have Teams meetings.

Client 3: Yeah. No.

Host 2: Yeah. You can just type a cool as email here. Are all the teammates.

Client 3: Oh, Oh, there you go.

Host 2: So this is the buffer you download the app so that we can this is called the sidecar car. So it's going to open up automatically when you have your meetings. And going to help you take notes during your meetings and then, like, a update you'll crm employee you. Tell your meetings. And you're done. So after... After this is done downloading. You can install it. It's really basically, we're are going to have the bot that joins your meetings automatically, and that records them and and this is why you're going to find your recordings after the wheels.

Client 3: Awesome.

Client 3: Right? So where are you in here where are you in europe right now in Venice Oh, nice.

Host 2: Or if S was bent good Yeah.

Host 4: Yeah Well, I have been in this south of my house for three years.

Client 3: And when I go up yesterday morning, there was a big puddle water next to my fireplace. So I have an idea that the rain was going sideways because... I think it went in through the ea and then came down.

Client 3: Like in the corner of my roof. So I have roof coming today My don't think it's a problem, but I think the rain was literally coming sideways that was literally coming in through. Because you know, in California, we have tile roofs. So there's like, a little blank space. So I think it was coming in that way, which is crazy because it was pretty heavy rain two nights ago.

Host 2: Is insane. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm considering moving back to funny. I'm not looking for to this kind thing. Yeah.

Client 3: Okay. Great. So now I can just open it up and I'm good.
