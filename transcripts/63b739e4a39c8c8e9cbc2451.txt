Host 1: Hello?

Client 2: Christina, hello, Can can you hear me okay?

Host 1: Yeah. You're great. Can you hear me?

Client 2: I got your loud and clear. You bet.

Client 2: For coming some time today.

Host 1: Yeah. So I'm just gonna let you know you may or may not know this, you know, California is under a lot of water. So my power is gone in and out. So if If we lose each other, i will go on my phone, but my power just got restored yesterday. And so and see what happens.

Client 2: No. No worries at all. I completely understand we've got... We've got quite a contingent of folks in the Bay Area as well. So I was just on a call with a couple of them. So the struggles are real. Right?

Host 1: Are February, Californian and so we're kinda wimp about the stuff but...

Host 1: Oh yeah. It's been nice. It's been a lot of... It's been a lot of rain for sure, but we need it, so we can't really complain too much. So Yeah.

Client 2: That is the that's the silver lining in that they say.

Client 2: Right?

Client 2: Well, good. Well, I know we have a short time together today. So first, thank you so much for your time. I know you're you're probably busy at I feel like I'm in still kind of in this holiday fog that I'm trying to unpack from a little bit. So I'm not sure if you if you share that sentiment, but I do appreciate your time with me here today Yeah.

Host 1: I wanted to meet you and talk... Talk a little bit more.

Client 2: Great. Well, hey look, I I like to sort of just I view this sort of as a first touch point to try to get know you a little bit better and then give you an opportunity to to to hunt around and and poke around at what we're doing here at flyer. And and any other questions that you might have. But I've had a chance as you can imagine to look at your resume and your your profile on Linkedin, which I tend to use quite a bit. And one of the things I'd love to do is you've got you've got a really impressive and diverse background in in a lot of different roles. So maybe if we could, could I just sort of have you kinda walk me through in your own words, your professional journey thus far and And along the way, what what are the sort of things you picked up that you think are relevant to what you know of as the... As the role we're trying to fill here at flyer.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, as as you saw, I mean, I've been a travel tech for twenty plus years. You know, started like a lot of people in the bay area, you know, the doc com, friends working at Yahoo and ebay and all those great things and really wanted it to to be part of it. Two Ipo, two acquisitions, everything from a four person start up in in a three hundred square foot space to, you know, five hundred plus employees But I I really think what my story is, it's really about building and scaling.

Host 1: I have done it consistently throughout my career. Whether it's been predominantly on the sales and kind of account management or client success side, or most recently moving more into the operation side and actually leading tech teams, which is completely different than I've ever done.

Host 1: And I'll tell you intentionally that why I made that move because I think you probably... You'd look at my resume my linkedin dan like, okay. Why is she applying for this role and, you know, Why is it choose Ceo? And I and I get asked that a lot. Number one, at this point in my career, don't wanna be a Ceo.

Client 2: I know what I'm I know what I'm get at.

Host 1: And I love building and scaling products and teams. That's where my passion is, that's what I'm really, really good at. And so you know, within the each company, I worked out whether it's travel zoo or kayak or Vacation, what's always been critically important to me is that I'm gonna be able to go in and contribute with my experience and whether that's overall for the company or for a specific team, that's important for me and that's what I enjoy doing and building tea and creating future leaders, like it warms my heart, and I know it's very sap be when I see people like, someone just got promoted at open table, and she was Out college and she was my intern. And now she's running... You know, now she she's a vp at open table. That's just it's really personally rewarding. And I really enjoy that. That component of it. But it's it's from me these organizations, they're always filling a need or solving a problem in the market. That's really paramount to any of work in like, is there a problem does something need to be fixed? Or is there something missing? And so I've been very intentional about where I go to make sure that that meets my criteria, and I don't have an ego having worked at startups like, take the trash out. I'll do the dishes. I don't care. Whenever.

Client 2: Yeah Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. Kind of have that kind of attitude. And I've always really enjoyed kind of the ever changing embracing the growth, I think I didn't take a job a couple of years ago Amazon, and Amazon's an amazing company. I knew being in a box was not for me and and my dna and who I was. And so you can see throughout my career. It's mostly kind of been building and scaling aid and when I moved most recently into the operation side, it was because it was skills that I really didn't have. Like, I had it at a surface level. But I thought this is really gonna challenge me to do something completely boring. Yes, it's still travel, and I'm very familiar with it. But, you know, building products, writing requirements, leading tech teams totally different from what I've ever done, but I was up for the challenge. And I've really enjoyed it because I think it's really allowed me that I can speak more technical. I can go ahead and have those conversations and not be like, I don't know. You have gonna asked the sales engineer. I don't really know who the answer to those questions like, I feel I have a. For that. And also how to engage with product and engineering people But I will say, I miss building and scaling and growing and working with partners I've really enjoyed my time, but I realized that this is where I actually wanna be and why I actually applied flyer was because I wanna move back into those type of of roles. It's where my passion is. I've enjoyed it, but right or product requirements stocks, is not something I wanna do long term. It just... I'm good at it. I don't really enjoy it.

Client 2: And so.

Host 1: I started to kind of look at new opportunities and I'm talking with people because I just wanna move back into that that type of role and where at now, they're just... There isn't an... There isn't a fit. And I think with the Flyer, what caught my attention was revenue management is broken. I mean, I will tell you a short story. So I kind of base at Vacation. We manage a portfolio of twenty plus resorts At the time, I came on, I was babysitting city like say baby city because I had no revenue management experience. And we had nine properties, so i think nine one hour meetings at minimum and it would be three analysts, myself. My operations person the Gm, and then we had white glove service from our revenue management software solution that we use. So anywhere from, like, seven to nine people on a call talking about rates and availability. I'm like, And then the analysts would have one set where he thinks the average daily rates are, but then the revenue management a software solution people said, no. it should be like this. And I'm like this is insane. This is so perfect. Like, why is it this more automated? Why are there so many people? And I just... I... And they're like, well, this is a way always it what? And I'm like, well, that's the scariest thing anyone can say to me is because that's the way we've always done it.

Client 2: Right.

Client 2: Right.

Host 1: My experience of working with, like, airlines and their legacy systems and everything and trying to bolt on revenue management it's just really antiquated and broken and I liked... What flyer was doing and just trying to kind of change that and empower these analysts to make better decisions and not be living in kind of spreadsheets. Yeah. I'm sure there's still some spreadsheets, but I just... I lived it and it's not it's not fun, and it's not scalable and there's too much room for human error. I mean so many times I would have a Gm call they're like, we didn't sell out this week. And what's going on and then I look, Someone fat finger what the rate should I mean, it's like, wow. And as you know, it's perishable inventory. Once, you know, once the thing taken off, you can't can't fill those seeds. And so it's lost revenue, it's lost opportunity and it's just Yep.

Host 1: And was a challenge. So when I saw the opportunity of kind of leading the you know, plant success team, and the problem you're trying to solve it really piqued my interest to really learn learn more because I know a lot of the other kind of competitors, so to speak, they're pretty antiquated. I don't know all the ins and outs on the concept set, but between sa and Ama and some of the others. Like, they're not known for patients. And I'm not knocking them. It's just they're very large organizations and they move increasingly slow. For sure. Basically on my.

Client 2: So in your background here you've done like you said you done sales you've done account management you've done. It looks like commercial ops. You've done you're now doing sort of call it operations just to be you know, to be generic enough. You reflect on all of those things and all those experiences, what was your favorite? Role that you that you had. Like, if you could teleport back in time and just live that that dream job. What was it?

Host 1: I think my time and Kayak was really... It was the most fun. It was a lot of work and it was hard, but what I really enjoyed was really building things out from scratch. Writing those playbook books and growing the organization and especially when we moved globally. I really enjoyed that. Like, moving into new countries kayak was, like, starting over. Right? And thinking about how people do business in those countries and hiring and product positioning and changes we need to make I really enjoyed that because for me, I love to learn. And to push myself and so it gave me new opportunities every time we went into a different country, things real slightly sometimes different I really enjoyed that. I had had a lot a lot of fun doing that. And so if I could teleport, I would love to do that. Again, it was it was it was a lot of fun for sure. I learned a lot, which you know, it's is always important to me that I'd be learning things.

Client 2: And then help me understand the at Kayak, the account management type activity where those were were those what I think of those is like, o Ta or who were who were those accounts that you had responsibility over So...

Host 1: Yeah. So the the Ot a's the airlines the car rental companies the hotel shades, tourism boards, it was mostly... It was mostly suppliers and the Ot a's. Okay. So, you know, our renewal rate I mean, I didn't even track renewal at kayak because I didn't need to because we were able to get the partnerships going It was really about scaling and growing because it it's was like, hey, you know, this partner doing everything that with us. And by the way, can you grow it by another twenty percent year on year and it's like, okay.

Host 1: And then he's also Like, don't make... you know, go ahead and grow this ot by twenty percent but just make sure the percentage of the revenue pie doesn't doesn't grow too much that we're putting all our eggs in wood basket because if they pull out whatever reason, we're not gonna be in a good financial position. It's like...

Host 1: Alright. Let's please responsible playbook on how we're going to accomplish this.

Host 1: But we were. And so a lot of what I did I kayak was really on on the growth and account management side. I had on average, probably four account managers for every sales person because it was really growing those partnerships. What which was critical to our success. It was, you know, hiring the right people making sure we had our playbook and our plans in place and being able to kind of execute and I always like to say, like, I wanted my team to know their business as well if not better than the people there. Because you got to know the ins and outs and the and know as many people as possible to create the stickiness in the partnership that they see it as a real partnership and we can grow and it's not a set and forget it because you you can't do that in this business for sure. And as you know, I mean, some of these big suppliers moved really slow. Right? You, they And it's it's definitely, you know, the steady pace of going after those partnerships and spending the time.

Host 1: Really return dividends and just making sure I had the right people as i'm and working those relationships and always training and engaging on finding ways to be relevant with the partners because you have your dis disengaged partners. You have your power users. I mean, you get all varieties and how do you go about continuing to grow those partnerships in different ways. But my account management team was responsible for predominantly all of the upsell. Not the contract renewal. That was still the salesperson, and they were still somewhat involved, but mostly all of the the growth came from the account management team.

Client 2: So help me understand the you know, it's as we look across any sort of B to b and even Saas companies my in my experience, and you you probably have a similar perspective as well. You know, the the words account management and customer success sort of vary right from from business to business pretty immensely. So For us, our model is you know, just to give you glimpse of the environment that we're we're trying to be successful in. Let's for the purpose of this discussion, let's just assume airlines but know that the verticals that we're pursuing and things like rental car, cruise ship rail are remarkably similar the one exception is hotels and hospitality. So... But for that, it's... fairly hyper focused market know there's there's over seven hundred and fifty active airlines on the planet today, of which we wanna do business with maybe maybe six hundred of them. Right? And what we're talking about here are agreements so enterprise Saas agreements that are typically five year terms and of anywhere between at the floor, two million and at the ceiling twenty million dollars per year in recurring revenue.

Client 2: So the we're we're doing very, very low volume, but high value activity with a very small pond. Right to to fish in here. So for us, the model we're building and it's it's mostly due to my my sort of general philosophy, and I think we're proving it to be the correct one, but the jury still out. Is we have hunters and farmers. Right? So we have a... We have a field sales team that's very, very focused on on entering the doors creating executive relationships, qualifying working through discovery, and getting to an getting to a commitment point. N during that pre sales process, the vision is is that we bring in customer success. I view these folks not as by No means junior, I don't view them as, you know, forty year experienced either, but these are folks that that will intend to live within the account. And for me, that means maybe one maybe two accounts in region based on where the installed base lives. And those folks will have sort of responsibility for driving to product acceptance and adoption to spotting opportunities for for upsell cross sell for leading strategic business reviews for having their ear to the ground inside of the customer... The customer's business to to be able to work with our internal teams in the event that they spot a risk or an opportunity they'll have the relationships to go talk to the senior decision makers you know, at any point and and earn that meeting and earn that share of time from them. And then ultimately, that all leads to what should be a really relative a straightforward renewal process. So in in that model, Right? What is your experience been across your background that's sort of similar to that. And what did you learn and what could you apply coming in to help us build that framework, process people tools. To support our ambition.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, i I think what you touched on, is is a lot of what I i did is setting up when you talk about the travel space, there is a finite number of troubles suppliers go after. Right? It's it's we're not companies I've worked. Not Doc we can go over all of these different Most of where It worked it's very been very hyper travel focused and and relevancy in in travel and so I set up my team's very similar where I kind of looked at it like, know the salesperson is, you know, doing the qualifying, negotiating the contracts, but my account managers, whether I was at travel zoom, kayak, dripping, wherever I kind set up that same infrastructure where the account managers we're very aware of what was going on.

Host 1: They already had pre assigned accounts whether they were actively working with us or not. And they were working as a team as a pod so that the salesperson drove that they were aware of what was being agreed to so that they felt confidently that they can execute on it. And so we kind of establish those teams in advance so that when the contract was signed, and now we have to go to implementation and ongoing up selling. That's kind of when the account manager would take you kind of lead those discussions our salesperson a waste kind of now in the passenger seat. They kind of reversed roles but we really that kind of pod infrastructure and to your point, I also set up where there was only a finite night number of accounts that each account manager would manage and in some instances, as you pointed out, like, for, let's, say, it's media group, it's massive. I mean, I just is I had a team just dedicated to them. They didn't do any... They didn't manage any other responsible for any other accounts. And so depending on the value of those accounts, I structured that and my my team was, you know, based on their experience level, Obviously, you're gonna have a little bit more senior and I don't need to your point people with forty years of experience, leading the, you know, the the larger partnerships. And for me, a larger partnership isn't... It wasn't necessarily always high dollar value sometimes, although it it was often, it could also be because I've worked in the Meta space. And within Meta, it's all about speed and comprehensive. So even though Southwest airlines pain very much. They were critically important to our sense. And so I had a very senior person in my account management team managing now partnership and making sure that you were growing it and and doing all of that. So I set up my team's very similar to what you were saying in that There's only a finite amount. And so where the growth leads the company's are gonna be is within the growth of those those relationships and not the burden churn of okay. Well, we can go into these industries and go after this new business. It wasn't high volume. Because, again, only so many partners to kinda go after. So it was really about farming those relationships and making sure they were utilizing and leveraging every product that made sense. For them. And so we would create these project plans internally of, okay, this is what United is doing with us what else could they be doing? This is what we're working towards know, do we have the right relationships? How are they engaging, you know, are we getting those weekly meetings if that's what was Say, you know, how often are they logging in and using the tools? I mean, I I had a lot of different measurements of client engagement and success. And most of the contracts were... Yeah, as you pointed out similar where they were anywhere somewhere six months, but most were a year to five years in length.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: So very similar story. And having done that multiple times and scale that and also made adjustments to the team over time. Right? So as new products and changes in the industry and and how we position things and who we put in in the right roles, you know? Because as you're scaling teams as you probably know I'm always thinking about the kind of the four r's, Right, which is like, do you have the right people in the right rules? Maybe today, Lucy is great in this role, but in a year, she might not be the right person because maybe we made changes within the product or the organization or what have you? It's always you know, especially client success, account management. That can be high churn. Right? So you've always gotta to be actively recruiting retain, obviously, identifying great talent retaining that talent making sure they're being pushed you know, and then remediation, unfortunately, I think that's the reality our worlds is, you know, if someone is not carrying their weight being able to identify that quickly and if it can't be rem, then making some some decision. And sometimes it always comes back to when you're in growth, Are they just not in the right role? And I've seen that time. Where it's like... Yeah. Maybe we need to put them in a different position to to be more successful. So very common.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Very common.

Host 1: Similar story to what how you've kind of structured it because I think like you've seen. It's it's not a true Sas and the fact that there's can be thousands and thousands of of clients. It's really about that core base of opportunities and making sure you're you're farming that and and growing those to the levels that they need to be to be full not only for them, but for obviously for flyer as well.

Client 2: Sure. Hey, hey. On that thread, the let's Dive into one of those r's there particularly the recruitment one because I think it is you know, the person that comes in into this role is going to have an immediate need to to hire a team of individuals based on our installed base. So we are a little bit behind the power curve in that area. Talk to me a bit about about how you how you go about the recruiting process, what you look for what are some red flags that kinda warn you but in your experience bringing on new talent into a startup company like ours. I'd love to just sorta of understand your approach to it and how you've been successful.

Host 1: Yeah. Sure. So I mean, when I think about when I was, like, building teams from scratch, Right? Or at a gotten h I personally believe in doing a lot of the recruiting myself. I feel like when I'm building a team marina team, I kind of know what I want and I I've not really had a lot of recruiters. Like, internal recruiters, like, a kayak did all my own hiring, I did my own analytic did everything myself. So i'm I'm not It... It's it's inherently in me to always be looking on Linkedin. I would always talking to partners like who you best reps? Who are you working with who do you like? Because if they're telling me oh, you know, you know, Matt over at Google is amazing, You know, maybe I'm gonna reach to matt and talk about an opportunities It's always about the networking. And I think an account management client services, like referrals are really big. Because oftentimes, you know, they know you you have people on the team that no other people that might be a great for the role, they can can kinda share with them the expectations and kind of what it's like to work in the organization, and let's be honest people, Aren't gonna people if they don't think they're gonna be success be the right candidates. Even sometimes it doesn't work out. But what I look for is And what I've seen in startups is I actually don't look for people who come from the big brands. I've been at Google for the most part, I know used as as an example or you know, at Amazon because I think they're oftentimes used to a different structure sure. And it's not to say they can't be successful, but I'm looking for kind of young, really smart, quick learners who've maybe been at of company two or three years, maybe looking for another opportunity where they can take on more responsibility because I think get any start up. Right? There's always lots of.

Host 1: Quality and they embrace change. And so I'm always just looking for really energetic work. I also tend to have hired a lot of athletes. So former college athletes, whether it's soccer basketball I have found that they know about teamwork, they know about rigorous prioritization. They're quick learners. And I found a lot of success in hiring athletes. So that's actually something that I look for because I think just their experience and being a student athlete is not easy and I have two kids who play college athletics, so I know what they've done and how they been able to to be successful. And so I'm constantly just kind of leveraging my network, looking for people who are, you know, can be quick learners, I can typically get on a call until within five minutes whether or not I think they'll be a good fit for the team. And for me a lot of it is about you know, synergy and chemistry, how they articulate themselves you know, asking questions that maybe are tied to the interview just to kind of see how they'll respond. But I'm constantly interviewing and kind of networking and that's been some of the success that that I've seen. Looking for, you know, younger smart people who were career growth, leveraging network, and obviously internal employees I look at people who have done have interesting backgrounds too. I don't necessarily want someone who's been in customer success for fifteen years. I want some ideas because I think that's where you elevate teams is people come from different experiences and backgrounds, and they're like, we did it this way. Have you ever thought about that? Was like, well, no. That's actually a really good idea. So this just an example example of of different different things that that I look for and kind of building on the teams and always great energy. Right? No one wants to, you know, go into a client meeting and you know, I want people to have good energies so when they go into client meetings, you know, clients oh my gosh. These people are here. We love them. They're just they're so fun to be around. They have lots energy and ideas and That's really important, I think in in a client success, account management role for sure.

Client 2: That's great. And and if I were to reach out to an individual like that that's that's worked with you or for you in pass. What would they tell me about your leadership style?

Host 1: I think they would say that I am a very approachable and empathetic leader, look, life happens. I mean... And I want everyone on my team to always feel comfortable to come to me to talk about anything and everything. And I have found in my experience that you kinda get into the hood with people when it's not that four one on one. So I'm a big believer when you can do it and up Zoom. It's a little more challenging, but going up coffee going out to lunch. I couldn't, you know, and really getting to know them as people And so I I think they would say that I am that person who leads by example, I do not micro. I I can't when I've work for startups. Like, I have to trust the people that I hire. That they're gonna have the tools that they're they need to be successful. And if they need help they're okay to raise their hands. And I always start with every person that I've ever hired that reported into to me I always start with... What do you wanna get out of this? Like, What's your passion what's your career? Let's put plan together and work for it because most people don't wanna necessarily be in client success for twenty years years. Right? They have ambitions maybe to do other things I want them to feel comfortable to talk to me now about that and be like, Great. You wanna go into marketing, let's get you really good here and working. And then I can you know, speak with marketing, maybe if a role opens, you know, we can talk about it because it's all about retaining great people. Whether they go to another team or not, I think for the health and culture of a company that that is just a test of the leadership, but then also up the company. Kayak I had the most pooped team in the organization and people would... Don't get really upset. I'm like, no. I consider it. A compliment and we're just returning grateful. So i... It's not gonna bother me and In fact, that's a better transition plan than someone who believes and goes somewhere else. And so I think they they would talk a lot about that that I'm pretty humble. I'm a hard worker. I get life happens. Lead through example, I'm not gonna to micro you and I will fight for my team. I think when you're a leader in this type of role, a lot of it is the internal selling. You know, and talking with people making sure they have everything that they need to be six successful. And I always tell people on my team. I'm like, I don't know everything if I did I be solve a much bigger role problems I don't know everything.

Host 1: If I did, you know, I'm just I'm humble like that. So think when you say things like that, people always feel a lot more comfortable just to to talk into question things. And I always I I loved debate you know, I love it when young people or just out of college wanna debate me about something night I find it really engaging in rewarding. And so I think that's what they would say a lot about me.

Client 2: That's great. And if I were to pry a little bit more and say, hey, what could what good Christina have done to be a better leader or coach or mentor for you. What what response would you expect I would receive?

Host 1: So i I think one of the areas and this is something I've been working recently is, you know, I as a as a leader, I think I could have spent a little bit more time on looking at different tools and analytics tools and things for my team to make their job faster better cheaper person to speak for lack or better description. I I think that was one area that I was kind of lacking on some of my leadership. Up until I would say now. I had teams of, you know, analysts and I always help them because I didn't have the the high level of skill set to help them troubleshoot. Less so on some of the other areas, but I've learned Sequel. I never thought I would. I actually think it's a skill set. Everyone needs to have in today's world. And I've been able to kind of overcome some of those deficiencies recently. I mean, if you'd ask me two years ago, would I know how to rent queries raise out of databases, I would said you're crazy. I'm never gonna learn that, but I did.

Host 1: Because I I saw it as some deficiencies where there were times where I couldn't help some of my team members because I just didn't have skill set.

Host 1: And I was very honest about it. I was like, I can't help you, but I'll find someone who can. But Now I'm I'm getting better, and I can run some queries and and do some other things and trying to to get better at it for sure.

Client 2: That's amazing. Yeah. I think keeping up with technology is it is really challenging. Right? As a leader. And then knowing which technology actually is going to materially impact the day to day work activity is even, I think even even compounds that problem statement. But that that's a good answer.

Client 2: You learn for sure.

Host 1: No. It's just gonna segue. It's just... There's so many tools out there. It's like what do you use? What's gonna be impactful? Like, you know, it it's it it it's overwhelming for sure Yeah.

Client 2: And, you know, it's it exists and particularly in the role we're talking about. Right? Like, I you'll I get at least an email a week talking about some sort of customer success tool or framework that I should be buying and putting the use. So it not only... Not only is it complicated enough, but it's it's also a red ocean of technology that that is gonna make all of our lives easier. So that's that's a cult scenario to work through. But it's one that frankly we're gonna have to work through here. As well. Yeah as we make as we place some bets on the right tool set to to to manage our accounts in the most effective manner.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I talked to... I talked to, you know, my daughters and and it sales she works at O. And I'm I'm always that. I'm like, what tools do you use? And she's like, fifteen to twenty tools and I use, like, two. She's a? Two seconds to complete ways, and like, i we told your manager that just like, no. And I'm like, you should. She just give them some because just assume everyone's using it and everything else, you know And so it it'll you said a a red ocean, and it's just trying to figure out what make sense and you always have to be, like, thinking about it because what made sense six months ago or may not makes sense through moments.

Host 1: That's the other true.

Client 2: And what you may have, you know, what you may have placed to bet on earlier, you may have pivot away from and just to acknowledge that it it wasn't right.

Client 2: Right? That's the hard part.

Host 1: But...

Client 2: Hey you you I only have one more for you. I think you've you've answered it, but I wanna I wanna bring it back to the to the forefront. You you sort of answered in your introduction. Like, if you could If you could sort of design and create your next journey and your next role what would it include and why? Like, what next for you professionally that's really gonna gonna satisfy our scratch your itch.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, I love travel and even though I've dabble in the idea of going outside of it. I I just wanna stay in trouble. I think travel is just good for the soul. And there's just it's so rewarding for individuals. And so I I want to stay in travel. For me, it goes back to kinda what I said, you know, is the company fixing a problem, you know, or filling the need in the market it is is really important to me and kind of where I go. Also to be, you know, to be candid, it's who i report into whether it's a Ceo or the head of a growth, or the customer manager like, I need to I want to work with someone who's gonna see me as a colleague and we're gonna wanna win together. We're gonna wanna do great things and it's really that partnership and less of a you know, he reports into this person and we can't communicate that...

Host 1: That's really important because I I made a decision done even on my resume I took a job, and it was good money good company, but I went against my better judgment that I didn't have good chemistry with the person I was reporting into. And I took the rule anyway and within eight weeks, my husband said I have to quit because he can't deal with me anymore. Because I was just so miserable. I mean, his his tail management boiler room, like, oh, Kevin went on vacation.

Host 1: So now I'm gonna move his accounts to someone else to show him not to go on vacation. I'm like, that's not what you do. That is Yeah.

Host 1: It was pretty balanced. It's really important to me that I have really good. Like, chemistry with the people that I'm working with. That's really paramount. And then I think, you know, on what I'm doing, I as I touched on really, I love growing and scaling. I love building in helping grow future leaders that's what I'm good at. That's what I enjoy doing. And so I wanna go more in the kind of client assessor sales role where we shine really enjoyed is on the growth side to be honest with you. So do we take this partnership and take it to the next level? That's where I seen my own success that's what I find personally rewarding. I I do enjoy going after new business and getting that win, but I like the long tail. That's where I've seen the most success for me personally, and that's what I find really rewarding and being able to really help businesses grow. Is is important to me. You know. So I I look for the long term partnerships for sure. So you know, whether that's a two person startup or a thousand person company I'm okay with that and because I worked in every stages, but that's kind of what I'm I'm really looking for. I don't worry about titles to be honest with you because, you know, a c level executive title that a two person company is very different than fifteen thousand person company.

Client 2: Right?

Host 1: It's all relative. Let's be honest here. So I don't get too caught up titles. It's just more about the impact who I'm working with. And really believing and what we're doing is is important to me and It sounds easy, but been interviewing talking to people. It's just sometimes it doesn't align across the board. And so I'm not gonna, like, move into a new role unless those starve the line for me personally.

Client 2: Yeah. Got it. Well, hey, we're almost short on time, but I'd love to to give you enough ask any questions you might have in this early stage here is we're we're starting to try and fill this role.

Host 1: Yeah. No. I mean, I'd love to kind of hear a little bit about you why you join kind of what you're seeing in the market. I'm just kinda getting your your take on things. That's kind of a first start.

Client 2: Yeah. I and look frankly you nailed a lot of it earlier in our conversation. You know, I have spent my almost most of my career working in aviation specifically. But mostly with technology as well. And the frankly, when I heard about Flyer when I was when I was reached out to to talk about starting the commercial organization for the company. I didn't didn't believe the value proposition. I did believe that the the revenue management process and set of technology will, you know, with dates back to the days of paper tickets and there's a whole bunch of opportunity there. I also looked at it as a market that was highly entrenched Right? That it was it would be really hard to un incumbents unless unless a lot of of stars aligned. And through my due diligence, which meant I had previous relationships with folks at airlines that I could trust that actually were we're experiencing and using the software that flyer was building. I was just completely blown away. And what it meant to me was an opportunity to continue on this intersection of sort of aviation and travel and technology that's actually you know, purely through technology alone making such a meaningful impact to business outcomes. Which is what you dream of if you have an opportunity to build you know, a marketing sales customer support function around. So that's primarily my story. I joined the company just right around two years ago is the very first commercial person. And we've now grown it to it's not a huge demand side team that we're we're well over thirty people and we're probably going to to add a significant amount this year, mostly in this customer success area because we've we've now got a robust install base that that needs to be needs to be managed more more strategically.

Host 1: Right. And kind of coming into this this role, like, what do you see is, like, the steepest learning curve and what would be your advice on me getting up to speed more quickly.

Client 2: Yeah. It's a it's an insightful question that for me, I underestimated the amount of true domain expertise that was necessary to sort of obtain to overcome customer scrutiny, right? And and obtain sort of a respected partner voice at the table with those folks. So I I think that's really, really important that we spend some time whoever jumps into this role, getting comfortable and and at least basic proficiency here because it... Because then they're gonna be able to to surround themselves and the teams, build out the teams that also can pass that sort of litmus test with customers. But that's what it was for me. So I would expect that it's that it's something that we'll wanna we'll want to over index on in terms of focus. Whoever comes on board in this role.

Host 1: Yeah. That makes that makes a lot of sense for for sure. I... My understanding from Ta what dustin is that this is kind of a a new role in a in a in a filling position as well, like, what have you learned? So was there someone previously in the role? Or someone's currently in the role or are you just as growth has happened, you've kind of figured out, like, what what's required in order to, you know, fulfill those those partnerships and and scale the business. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Client 2: Yeah. I think it's more the latter. We we did not make huge investments in account management in that in the first year because we we had enough sort of supplemental lift across the organization. And a lot of our customers were in a very early implementation phase. So it the focus was really on. Service delivery teams, professional services, And the we did have we we started with a framework of sort of a global customer success organization but we've we've as we've gone through now, dozens of implementations of our services. It became very clear to me last year that we need to have a more high touch model that what we thought was going to be the case for getting getting our customers up and operating and adopting was not reality. And so the... As as that became more and more clear and the data around that became more and more clear. I pivoted immediately to saying, alright. We we really are going to have to build a a much higher touch customer success organization and then any of us had anticipated And that's what led to sort of creating this model of regional leaders that will be responsible for the accounts within the region and more specifically the the the strategy for managing those accounts from from a people perspective. But they'll share a common set of tools and processes as well as they'll share all of the sort of dotted line resources of across the business. Owning the customer from a local present sort of perspective. So that's really where where it's been. It's... So we did have a vision run customer success. It was completely ref period at the end of last year, and now we're executing on that new vision.

Host 1: Okay. No. That makes that that makes sense. Especially like you said, know you get started with something, You think it should be organized as certain way and structured, And then once you put it into actual reality and things you need to make adjustments. And I always think it's always important you know, the team to understand. They're going to be changes and embrace it and know of course.

Host 1: Course. Any of those expectations for sure. I mindful up your time too. I can ask questions all day long.

Client 2: So do not. Go ahead. Yeah. I I can... I can probably do one more here and then I can we can wrap up.

Host 1: Outside of just the domain experience, that you think is necessary and that we kind of learn coming into it. What surprised you about flyer that you weren't kind of expecting? Like, from a company perspective of a culture perspective, what what were what were you surprised You know, I I I have a couple of startups ups in my background So the but there's always something right there you go holy cow.

Client 2: Okay. I think I think for me the the surprise has been the pace. So I expected a fast moving organization. But, you know, I reflect on last year and you know, we started selling one product it moved to selling over four products across multiple functions in the same of the same sort of what we would call sort economic buying center in an airline but different functions. We made two acquisitions that expanded that even further and dramatically changed the our go to market strategy and our positioning and our narrative. So all of that happened and no kidding in eight eight months time. So the pace was not I was expecting things to move fast. I wasn't expecting them to move that fast right? And so that meant that our the team building the team and how to have a massively high tolerance for ambiguity we had to be really scrappy we had to recognize that we're that it if something was needed to support whether it's a sales pursuit or a customer business review, it likely had to be built probably wasn't digging into a into a library, right, to do these things. So that that I don't think you can ever be prepared for fully. But it it was probably the biggest that the pace at which we move is incredibly fast. The fastest I've ever seen.

Host 1: Yeah. No. I saw all the recent acquisitions and acquisitions can be you know just incorporating everything when i can keep the company completely on its own entity or you incorporated and roles and responsibilities and techno... Yeah. In Hr it's insane.

Client 2: It's absolutely insane. Yeah. Well, hey, Christina. So we're I think our process here we've got a few candidates that we're doing there doing the screening for initially from there, we'll we'll move to, you know, a small subset to to introduce to the broader team here. So I think we should be through that at some point next week. And I should be able to we'll we'll make sure that we keep you updated. But that would be the next step. You know, contemplating that I can get through all of the initial all of these initial conversations. In the course the next few days.

Host 1: Okay. No. That sounds great. And if there's... you know, anything in my experience or anything we us that you wanna expand on or have questions, you know, feel free to reach out to me. I'm happy to jump on a call or answer via email, text whatever communication style you like. I'm happy to do.

Client 2: So. You bet. And likewise, you've got my contact information so don't hesitate to reach out.

Host 1: Well, do. I appreciate your time. It's been a pleasure and hopefully I will speak soon.

Client 2: Yes. And good luck with this weather. Hopefully, you guys can get through it quickly.

Host 1: We will we will. And So always good.

Client 2: Alright. Let's hope it stays on hope it stays on.
