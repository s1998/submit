Client 2: double tap sales strategy. Not I call. Okay. Cool. That's guys. Like like I said, we little bit trimmer on content because we've been just a woman you guys all types of new stuff lately. And we're clearly an execution mode. So we'll we'll jump in probably chance to end up a little bit early. So... But go to go into track call that which you know we've been past due on for a week or two. So numbers update. So let top left hand size bookings on the the month. Again, single about that's was just awesome and and definitely pulled our gold back with within reach. We definitely have the pipe to a eclipse something around four hundred what puts us around the best month ever, and then we still our structural in place know we're all marching towards a at a very aggressive goal of six hundred, so we can flag out in our fuzzy custom sweatpants pants, But still very well you know, far away at this point, but We have the pipe. I mean, it's been pretty clear It's I mean, monday was, like, a day of a lot of nose and pessimism and then the last two days had a lot good stuff around. So Yeah. Just wanted to flag top left the inside there bookings and then top right on the quarter shut leads for taking the top spot in that connect contest with with Selwyn, and then right, and nick as well battling for third place here. So if for we're add bookings on the quarter we're at nine twenty three right now, Like I said, it it seems kinda like a brainer her clips. The best quarter of remark, But as we know we you wanna kinda blow that out of the water. So all hands on deck of course, for miguel next two weeks here. I did pull in the stage conversion from one to two. Just focusing on the trailing couple of months here. mind stuff the most recent week, which will be a little bit low naturally. But still good to see kinda where we're at here. We were seeing kinda of subtle improvement When me like last three months maybe the last two. Three I'm see it. When look at that data but just at a high level there, we are seeing cell improvements here We're seen on a win rate basis as well. Versus last quarter or so the efforts are are gonna take effect and appreciate you guys I'll hands on deck. Some of these trainings we've done and obviously, the ones that were we'll talk about today that we're we're doing next a god's question latest numbers?

Client 2: Cool. wanted to flag a few things on on new pricing. So even since our last conversation. We've seen to out a bit more direction And maybe not what the pricing is specifically look like, but more so on how we're going to like, how this will take effect. So I do wanna flag a couple of things I'm actually gonna skip my first point and go to my second, which we'll set us up better, which is that supposed to say read packaging. So see has go start rep at. So they're not going to... It appears you know, very, very likely of newer contracts are aggressive and allow do this. They're Not been tell a customer, hey, you lost all this functionality you're now in pro and, like, you know, you're you've been hosted by Mosaic, pay us more money. I think we're at obviously out the project got take. I get some calls on that. So just now like, we're not like, doing this every customer, you know, a January first. But at renewal, we're gonna start to see where be pick one of certain packages will likely be kind of an ad hoc discussion on each account. Just to know, like, hey, if are using certain functionality, if not, we upsell to them. So might seem a little bit awkward, but it is kind of a natural point of maturation for org that are going on package route. We kind see where we can squeeze, you know, value of our customers build and up upsell inventory and then go ahead and attack from there. So they will be selling add ons in the new year. So things like metric builder if clients maybe using aren't, stuff like that. Obviously we're talking with prospects about that functionality and they needed to get a deal done this period and they want that included. Obviously have speaking to that. But I do wanna flag, like, let's not promise the world if we don't need to. But, if you have a buyer who isn't it too interested inquiry builder database connections or you know, hasn't been stuck on a limited user it's like, No need to firm that up and documented and reinforce that like, oh, you're grandfather into all these things. Like, do that when appropriate to close a deal at, you know, high Ac, but Please don't feel like you you do this. And and I would say, like, please caution yourself against ever just giving them like, grandfather for life across all future like, present customers request that carved up like some delicate language to make sure they're guaranteed, but it matters most, but Yeah. This signing out this year. Hey, you're locked on the price model for this year. What you're not left in for is perpetuity and a release we have you get free. Obviously, that's not how this will take effect. So you need any language for any clients who are stuck on this and like need some language added, please let me know. But did just wanna flag like, this is extremely important for the business. Honestly, I think it's probably biggest initiative for the business the next, like, six months is how do we start to expand on our existing customers. So that starts with us not setting off expectations and promising the world for folks and if we didn't need it. So I'll pause there. I realized, like, this was our I mean i had to condensed like five minutes as far as, like, what we need to do and there's still a ton to fix here as far as like what the pricing model is gonna be what are add on all that. Any questions, sir?

Host 1: For ones that we have talked about it too... So we, like make a note. Like, I don't wanna put in the contract, but we like make a note. Somewhere that way see us knows, at least That'd be helpful.

Client 2: Definitely and as part of your hand, communicating that level of detail would be would be awesome. Also too like they're gonna do it through our review. before they start reaching out to clients. Like they'll they'll do their due diligence so supply top by account. Got a strategy for each. So if the prospect is, you know, asking Cs to activate query order for them or do some work there? It would be very unlikely that your cs us just tries to upsell them. But, yeah in you can do on the expectation would be great. And, yeah. If they can live off contract. Even better, Cool. Anything else here guys Awesome. Yeah. Maybe sure just flag it to me. And we can we can talk put them together it's kind of a Nuance space. Cool Awesome, guys. Yeah. Again, huge initiative for us so helps us set not prompts here. Step up date. I think my slides are out of work from when I intended, but as good update, Nick, locked in, Leaandra right there, Selwyn right there.

Host 1: I got mine Denisha. I'm I have really?

Client 2: Where was the first? Sorry. I was off my there that was refreshed like, twelve five or something like.

Host 1: With Sig has five hundred dollars of implementation.

Client 2: That's right. I'm looking at the bookings report. So we that five hundred on setup. Okay. We did say setup up was included. So good stuff there. But okay. I think for the call. Was, I did that twenty four five and I was let like, gosh, I wonder how that took effect Well, cool. I'll do the slide look process send it back out, but good stuff there. Okay. Selwyn jumping back in. And Rabindranath has it deals as well to get this. I know we have at least Rabindranath there in that So i'll be cool we through the table here. And again, guys, this has been awesome for the business sell larger deals, something will continue to do next year.

Client 3: I heard if we all got it. It was an extra three k each bus.

Client 2: You hear that for me. I don't think I up from George. You guys there. Always find new ways to squeeze extra steps out of us. I always say your comp plans, the the best if you could ever imagine. Cool Awesome. Have a... Yeah. I nick that's true, but evan won't hit it. So I about that Alright. Cool. You know. Awesome. So some scoping stuff. So First of all, the attention here on this has been great guys. It's like, I really appreciate how thoughtful you've all it in. Obviously, like, there's it's a time of year when like, deal velocity matters so much And I think we've done a good job of balancing in that and data he's been understanding to it. Just a flag to use edge channel because there has been some one off com's going around had to flag to both expect you think Scope is gonna be a block for end year, please leave me in. Like, We want this to be a healthy validation step for both sides, but it should not hold up a deal. So please just let me know if that's the case and we can by way maybe tackle sync or just sent expectations with a prospect without maybe the data team needed to be on the call potentially again, loop me in would you ever get to anything like that But just good wanna flag it. We'll have pop up right before signature potentially on some of these deals or when where you send out your ski we realized there was a new nuance, we maybe sidestep out that needs to be addressed. So seeing some of that and we're something that a good game reached us to get scope, but if you identify this and it, you know, we're running out of run, Please let me know, and we can find a way to make sure that that's not holding back potential deals. But please stick to the process again. So now if you're at flag that in Salesforce that you've scoped out with you know necessary parties, my last team meeting updates you guys has all the links here, but Yeah. Please just continue to get us just going, but remember that we gotta get deals across. So me in that when necessary there. Cool question on scoping and the areas of back dictation which and learnings think a learning is nets build for Arr is very tricky, potentially.

Client 2: Yep. Yep. That is the case. Yeah. The reason for that is just it's just set a customizable kinda empty shell that, like, speaking to what field they have and what data they have and, like, it customized, like, literally with code customize something in their instance, It becomes very typical difficult to kinda I crack that open, but that is a is a fair call out. I think as we learned this month, been doing anything and that's it's it's very difficult. George for your knowledge. We have our four customer who's spent north of a hundred k on that's of implementation. So Yeah Necessarily really screw the poo for from oz this quarter, but Yeah. Good let, there. Anything else guys? Cool. Awesome. Discovery decks. So obviously, you be hard certifications are next week during one on one. If you happen that I wanna one with me yet this week, which I believe is just Selwyn at this point. We'll we'll talk about this. But essentially, Geology g will be looped in. It may not be able to tent, But if he's there don't be surprised. We're gonna conduct to end to end we're gonna do a certification process that was laid out. sounds like a lot of questions here from on lines, but jump. Did you have any call? Just want to flag and reiterate both the competitive focus that we have and the disco deck and just general pain discovery framework. I'd i add that is a third criteria. Gonna really our point of emphasis when Joan i looking at Gong leading into January and enter entering the early January period before we roll new things. So I just do wanna flag that Please add the team. If you guys are getting good, that be feedback on the deck. We've already had good be feedback come in, which has been in awesome and that's we're obviously honing on the message. But, yeah, just from their reminder, that'll happen next week. I'll get into what next week looks like we are gonna for calendar of our team meeting and our friday training naturally. So really, closing deals and in that thirty minute session and preparing for it, that's all you guys have to be focused on. Just call out, and wanna tried in a wild do this morning, Have cup with me either or feedback running I'd say for the deck maybe try to between it.

Client 4: I tried to run... I've run through it a couple times and It had good feedback but it it takes it from being less I don't know. It was kind of like less with a conversation that was presenting again. They're were like, okay. Cool. Now like, let's see the product.

Client 4: So, yeah, like, parsing it out, maybe a little bit more. I don't know. Maybe just some work on it. But... yeah, that... That's just what I both times I showed it. They're were, like, oh, this looks great. Like that would, like, show the thing.

Client 2: Gotcha. Okay. That's interesting to be back. Yeah. Let's let's carve that up, Selwyn. I I watch your first half out with it. That a second thing yet, but I know this and we can kinda clarify that. I did mention two a lot of people in one ones that We're being obviously very prescriptive and when we lay out this process but understanding that we'll need to flex this as certain products back twist arm, you know, again, seeing a demo or other things like that. So We'll talk about optional, definitely more so I wanna on Selwyn, but The goal is start process just kinda what that, you know, Yep process when executed. And maybe with prospect playing ball looks like, but then obviously understand that, yeah, we'll have flex for different prospect expectations. But, yeah. I appreciate the call there as definitely interesting, Maybe it's compelled to of Demos next. That's the that I thought about. So we'll try that. Cool. Sounds good. Awesome do have the product train tomorrow guys. So that training that we have held for sales is being conducted. We do wanna update on some products. We haven't had one of these sessions in a bit and obviously been a ton release and some reinforcement here, I think is is needed especially in the context of like, capacity. I know there's been product montage and all that. And some the road map webinars, but now i everyone with do ten. So wanna have I'll jump on training tomorrow. Do you wanna quickly like that looks like Yeah.

Client 5: It's just gonna be the the current product release, but probably gonna focus on a met builder to be honest or the whole time because it's like the world are oyster there. But what does that mean? Like, how do we pitch it and sell it and, like, actually showing some examples, I think will be beneficial. And then we'll also touch on, you know, different shifting timelines. There's a couple things that are got rep the last couple of weeks in terms of data integration. So walk at that. What does it look like, but really open Q and a for you guys. So definitely bring thinking cap tomorrow and any questions you may have. Brian Mart tell also be joining as well. Cool.

Client 2: Yeah. Is you guys in the past are definitely helpful and I appreciate the call that we're thinking about timelines person step relevant for the next couple of weeks share. But, cool. Looking forward that. Yeah. I think it's always good to get on the product. I mean, even during the webinar hour just yesterday, definitely a lot of things about head playing stuff. So lots of lots been released years. please I want make sure to attend there here available. Cool. Want to flag one many demo. So next one December twentieth this briefly last meeting. But please go ahead and drive attendance towards it. Think it's again again, it's like, custom demos preferred for sure, but anyone maybe not fit now or maybe wasn't interested, but this is a... You know, to get them fry the tool that with last friction, please. Go ahead and submit that information around. We're kind of related to this is the product lease webinar. So I attended this one yesterday I kind the the last one as well. And I think maybe now because we're in a cadence of doing this for customers that maybe that that our customers kind of understandably, I think this is more for them to kind ask questions and be engaged and treat almost an office hour session. So If you have prospects that attended, I would encourage you to follow with them just because dropped in with a lot of, like, really new nuanced questions. And some that we're completely off topic like, and something that were inaccurate. Like, why can't I share this canvas with person with this permission setting and realistically they could. So there was questions on some, like, back end data stuff. There was questions on. Like, head cal module that were not reflected very well. And we handled all the mind and it was great. But if you're like, a new prospect, you probably did not feel like are, you know, frankly our customers are just overjoyed with the product because it's naturally a new product release about gaps that we're filling in the system. So got someone there encourage you reach out to them. I don't think it's something you should be concerned about, but touching days for if they have questions or follow up would stay at the very least his worthwhile. And I would recommend doing that soon. We'll consider when we're we're doing future product webinar webinars is realistically their a huge use case here for our existing customers obviously. So said that we can rethink if we wanna drive a attendance store from a new new standpoint, but did wanna flag but the contact seemed to be a little bit more customer facing, mostly because of how our customers. Have anyone go that haven't checked in with yet or anything like that or We'll be hope we get a registration list you guys way. I don't know if actually saw that land. Have you guys have that time off?

Client 2: That'd be helpful.

Client 6: I got a from in so I can send that out.

Client 2: Oh perfect. Awesome, Rabindranath. Yeah. Could you send to me? I'll in this that and they'll to be group as well Yeah.

Client 6: And I just sent the recording to it in the chat.

Client 2: Awesome Awesome. Yeah. I took screen grabs that most of the chat comments that seemed like sensitive. I think it was a lot of our prospects. I'll take a double and soon back one that's relevant there. I don't know if the chad caught recording necessarily, but Yeah.

Client 5: Just that's why fyi I do... Like, they, like, granular questions on timing too. Like, they pitch like metric builders like, super early beta And, like, I'm assuming some of you guys might be pitching it as like it exists or it's gonna be existing by time. And so it's like a lot of those delegate things where they may be, like, wait. That's not what I've been hearing. Right? To Denisha point. Kind of sensitive it then in that sense.

Client 2: Cool. Alright. Let's getting. Do wanna flag this small update, but one that I think solves honestly one of our major objections of the app. You, Maximus for chasing this down. I i thought there gotta be some plug gonna continue a basic print to Pdf with some of the margins, but mark found it was it twelve bucks a year and can basically print to pretty up in Mosaic. So think we should judge position this as, like, you know, you can't do it in mosaic, but there's, you know, natively in mosaic, but we have mandate that do it for automatically. So, that'd be worthwhile. Honestly, again, it might seem in the weeds, but like, this is something objection that probably comes off, like, maybe twenty five percent of our demos. So We encourage you guys to have this objection handle ready to go, go full page Pdf. Early into to Google could not be more straightforward. I'm pretty much print to Pdf with margin trimming. So mark out here.

Host 7: Yeah. I can't take full credit for it. We're on a call right and eye with the prospect. was asking, can you guys print to Pdf and we're like, no. And then he's like, well, what about like a crow extension? So we looked it up and then found it. But it is super legit. I mean, it's exactly what prospects want. So I would just say, hey, like, you can easily do it. No problem. Yeah?

Client 2: Okay. Cool Awesome. Hey we can take credit. Don't care prospects.

Client 5: I good that we'll take care.

Client 2: Sure. Awesome. Moment. New security mutations. So we have a couple new things. We have a new master process dock think does reference are older ones. So don't worry that's not stale or anything. We have a kind standardized customer facing like any page just releasing. Essentially, you know, I'll jump it if I'm watching this at all, but page is going to be somewhere like our website page, but it's actually like a more standardized interface where like a security team, you just know that this portal has standard questions standard, like ratings for security procedures and all that. So It's a it's a way to judge shoot them a singular link where they can access can air from it also, and it's essentially, it's one link that it's all the other links that are kind of right now a little bit and a standardized portal for security folks so I'll stop watching that anything that's clear.

Client 5: But I could share. I can just share it my screen quick go on visual.

Client 5: So, basically, this is what the link will be It it'll show the badges, philosophy upcoming releases. And the biggest differences is, there's a transparency score. That gives us a a rating in terms of what we're transparent with, What can we offer in terms of it insights to the customer, and then there's a a Q and A search that the prospect this is external facing. You don't need to access it to convey. To go cert first certain and, you know, products or, you know, security questions of, like, what does mo do? What type of data is going in here So it's similar to, like, our thinking internal security. Find and search for those answers, and we're gonna introduce the add to this. And then for example, they wanna start seeing our soc too. They click on it, and then it'll automatically take him to compare to us access to. It. And then the second phase of this is to get you guys conveyor licenses, that you can go in and search for, Why are they clicking on when they last like in understanding if they're interacting with the data that kind of push along as well. And then we've also created our status page. So we have time now. Results that are happening day. So it makes us feel like, you know, we're taking security seriously. So we have a gap time, job execution, run time as well as knowledge base. So those are two the biggest improvements by at end of the day. This is the the link should should be sending them soon as they start thinking about security, you're asking about security this should be like the first one of the first things you'll probably send them.

Host 1: You said this is live?

Client 5: We're gonna we're gonna go live the this afternoon. Yeah. Then starting tomorrow.

Client 2: And i'll show the link out If you guys call in both market. This is also to again referenced in that new master as degree document. So pretty much just that doc billing here be linked to all of our old Dp tpa documentation, all that. So just kinda further consolidating and in a customer based way standardizing what they expect to see here Cool. Any for one thousand keep trying, I guess Cool. Thanks, Couple of miscellaneous updates. Wanna track through the rest of the month. So gonna that we're gonna pull meeting next Thursday just do that essentially it'd be in the last week of the month. Definitely wanted to reiterate a couple things here. First is that we really need to ensure that all technical validation go is done prior to twelve twenty three. Grouping you know, like, obviously, we're gonna do we can close deals for the rest of the year, but from a standpoint of, like, trying to loop it and, you know, Gertude for a late scoping call, you know, the day after Christmas, it's like it's just not going to be possible to schedule out in the same velocity that we would want. So great way of fork interact with your prospect. We should be leveraging this as like, hey, we need to at least get the technical validation in or scoping and I understand that we're the right fit for you prior to two of the week. So It's also worth noting our prospects very often are shutting down business between that same week that kind of holiday break is something that I'd say probably seventy five percent of the prospects we're working with last holiday day we're on. So It's a very sensitive time, but it's also a time when people want to get the things docker plates sooner it will start to creep in. So please expect know, that we should have all this wrapped up. And it's ideally just, you know, getting signatures on contracts, security legal opt just did wanna flag. Like, this is obviously a natural time to be positioning these. And far as when to position it, I think it's pretty clear like, if you haven't challenge a prospect yet, who is yet to be closed around who's out of office? What other stake looking to get review here? What does your legal process look like Would you ever receptive to a security legal opt out? Like, these are really critical questions that we need to ask. Otherwise, we are completely flying blind. And deals we did not close last... At the end of last month. I'll just buy it was a really successful the month for us. Should said end of last year, really was because just prospects did not have this stuff nailed down they didn't realize that there Cfo wanted approval on it or that they're, you know, general counsel was hesitant to on our Dp tpa or something like that. So are things that we... If we more proactive maybe, we could have pulled in a few extra deals. So let's make sure that we're we're doing that challenge to prospects now. Time year where it's obviously gonna natural, but If we haven't shaken down the answers to these questions by probably Monday Tuesday. Wednesday next week, then we're totally just playing I guess in game a part deal gonna be brought in So Yeah. Did wanna reiterate that. I'll be totally available for you guys to get deals across, but understanding that other stakeholders internal actually, maybe maybe harder to get a hold of and obviously, we'll do our best to escalate things, but understand that folks do need yeah. Sometimes a break. Cool here. I'll pause this guys. Any other thoughts considerations on this, I then we have kind of pipe in play still. So this is probably a key thing I everyone's mind. Any any questions here on what the next couple of weeks look left? Awesome. We'll meet on Monday, obviously to go through pipeline, and look that now probably guys help for that week. I mean, next week. But flag step on next year since start last kinda of like true teaming meeting that will have prior to that session. Things everything thing about for next year. This is more to get excited. No need to go ahead and start working of stuff. Another type of here. I'm saying that we're rethinking in the demo below. constant point of iteration for is we called it out that our tool is sometimes come off as too robust or too much. That's probably a factor of that we're maybe not demoing the specific guy the customers looking for early on the demonstration. We also think that, you know, integrations, although maybe a help explaining the app isn't nice to tell the sexiest way to start out the demo. So the way to enhance that, we're thinking about it. So All george myself, Frodo, really everyone's kinda thinking about ways to up level it. Really as tool has been up leveled. So more help coming on that. So I think it'll be kind of a fresh perspective on Shiny application, are one on one cadence and also thinking to to revisit. You know, realistically, these thirty minute check ins every week are just like we're craving so much into them that I'm thinking we can do hour one on ones and then just like thirty minutes. Hoc check ins and think it a little bit more flexible, but those one like, hour long sessions being really sticky. Just make sure we're being thorough out giving you guys like, a full help you need. I've just found that between deal updates and I executions and sometimes we're short on time for the other areas. So we're gonna explain a little bit of that just to make sure you guys more help Ross thinking about type tight demo flows for discovery. So something that we still to do a lot of the idea on, but realistically, There are some places tied today Selwyn's point like someone strong arms us to see the application, like, What's a way to give them a very tight, you know, t to get them on the next call where we know conversion will be pretty positive So obviously, more to come there. We're gonna have a sales playbook for you guys. So just bringing the together all the stuff we've done and all the changes we're going to make. If a one could use a document just to keep everyone sane and and keep efficiency solid. Something I wanna do with everyone as well is like, a twenty twenty two review. Don't think of this, like a performance review s. And this is more just us cracking open, like, every piece of data every documentation we have on like, how you perform for stage conversions, bookings, like, scoping and success of your customers prospecting all that. So I find that you're generally very helpful. It's not often and a function like ours goods it's time to reset and just display think about How perform. So after kinda sitting on it for the holiday break will come back and kinda have these these one on one sessions where we we just dive deep everything. So they'll they'll be an hour and we'll just essentially get it kind of report card going for how perform in every area, just so we have, you know, clean areas to execute on going into the year. Because obviously more to. We've all talk about. New pricing and, you know, the new inbound and outbound process and vacation as a... I could write down a million other of things here, but I just did wanna reiterate yeah. We're gonna still be looking to iterate and improve next during in the same, you know, head on approach, you guys took to the the change management, will definitely be new next year and appreciate that that for so far this stuff. I'll pass questions on next year, press the on. Cool. Jump in the tracker here guys. And like I said, we'll probably get you thrown away here early. So I'll pull this up another otherwise a couple call outs. See something can written down right now, get him in.

Host 1: I think mine. But Denisha I I kinda talked to you about this for the first point, just seeing a lot of services businesses or smaller companies that have like, a service component, kind of, you know, how, like, we started out. And I just feel like having that be part of, like, the road map for non Would not only help serve services, but also would help us with the larger businesses who end up needing the same thing like, allocations and You by product line and things like that. We see a lot more of that than like b to c.

Client 2: I think.

Host 1: Mh. And that's just one of the the pieces and then another one that I just added is you were on the cloud and then I had another one today called Drag. It's also a large customer. They have a lot of... Pretty much every, you know, product gap is kind of like, ticked off on that. And it's constantly just like, hey, This deal breaker Is this not? Like, can we support till we not, Just wanna know if we're keeping track of, like, the larger customers and, like, realistically, I know we have our Ic being, like, really high, but I know George, for you said, like, if it's a product gap, it's closed lost. But it seems like it's it's more... Like, it is a disqualify as far as like, can we support. So, I mean, if it's helpful, it can definitely like, tag bryan Vc all those gong, but like, it's really difficult to know, like, how many of these park gaps of them needing them? is gonna make this you know, it still a closed loss or a d q? Like, I feel like maybe, we should kind of reconsider that. And just, like, have that as an open item to like, hear their needs. But have more clarity around, like, you know, what's do from there when we're put up against, like, you know, a a company that honestly, probably does need. Like, the... I got asked today for this strongest call like, oh, can you guys scale with us? And I was like, you yeah We can scale with you. But it's like, you're almost scaled out and, like, I don't really know if that was a truthful answer. So Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah On it. I mean, I think your points share related, Like, it's all around like, where are we gonna pursue and spend our calories next year One thing that was on the list I just showed you of what next year looks like is a rethinking of our tearing. Matt Holly, and myself and Do and probably whether people are working on the tearing project, which will essentially just first is collect a lot of data, see where are we seeing opportunity not just from a new business standpoint from a yeah, customer retention standpoint and like, just overall the lifetime value of a customer. So That's gonna be considered and then we're gonna have the Sd and new inbound process that we've, you know, Have was a aligned f to. As well. So those be pretty substantial upgrades that will help hone in on what this looks like. I think there's still a lot thinking i'm around but that is, but You did call out like, hey, there's a lot of room improve upstream with within Sas clearly like, there's a lot of calls there definitely. But b to, like, you know, we're not too far off from that. There's a lot of tangent value that we already do provide and then services you're calling out as well. So these are all iterations, but i'll probably be a little a mix of functionality among all of them. You know, we are working on work a model dimensional functionality which help services are working on data scale, which helps me to see. So the things are being worked on. I don't think anyone this room for I'm jump in into Frodo Doors, you guys do have an thoughts here on exact where this is headed, but Yeah. Definitely on the radar to hone our our focus because, the tool expanded, you know, we don't want to just know, unruly expand our Icc. We wanna make sure we're still very targeted there because I think that targeted focus is really what's got mo egg to this point. So... Yeah. Plenty worry come here. I appreciate the call, but I don't think all the answers here since we're doing a lot of the two diligence right now.

Host 1: Kind of in that same vein as well, Like as the are, I turn on, it would be super helpful just to know, like, what universally we could support, like, for example, like, crypto, b, like, all these things, like, they love it when they see the tool, but it's kind hard to know, like, what they're gonna get the most value items us, just like, having maybe some kind of training on like, hey across the board, everyone gets value. X y z like, these are more wants saas, but, like, these are everyone's good Yeah.

Client 2: Go ahead. I'll pause on my comment not how like this Specific, like, areas that are agnostic across use cases, but George talking any any calls or jumped to that front?

Client 8: Yeah. I mean, I think just generally speaking, like, the product improvements we have made for twenty twenty three are gonna help with every industry. So services b to, like, really across the board. I think B is probably still the route we're gonna go down as far as, like, concerted go to market push So, like, hopefully, with the new inbound process, we are getting better at servicing everyone. But as far as, like, you know, putting real resources behind like marketing to B to customers that's probably what we're we will start. But a big part of, like, expanding the Ic is going to be hey, like, for services businesses, what can we offer? What do care about. So we'll definitely go through a lot of trainings around that. It it should be, you know, outside of Sas, like, the core of the platform is what's relevant, op planning. Account planning and basically, revenue not arr, not retention not go words. So we'll definitely spend some more time. So we'll spend a lot of time on that. In q one. But really, I think that the easiest way to think about it. Is just I can boil it down the basics, and that's probably what they'll care about but we'll definitely can definitely do some trainings around it.

Client 2: It's a good call george around, like, list for your knowledge like there's gonna be a little bit difference of, like, who we sell to and who we really like build go a market efforts shorts because it's a little bit different to just head fit versus probably a fit for us to go sell to. Know I mean, So if we get inbound services companies that a good fit for us like Maybe always go and sell them and because we have dimensional they need let's say in six months. Perfect. But are we gonna have necessarily your bring ourselves like you know, F a tool for services companies, like they may not that might not be super valuable and harder right business. So got it. It's kinda like two factors there, at least at least do factors there when considering that. But yeah. I think similar to how we have such a sound focus now when we ever make a formal pivot into something... Might be to see there early be like, formal kind of vertical training and, like, where they care about why your business is are different Absolutely Your point on, like, the agnostic use cases, not the be too quick care, but typically head count expenses and reporting from, you know, those two sources are what's most standardized. From there, it actually becomes very custom just because we're stepping out of the realm of finance some accounting, So Salesforce revenue data, all that stuff becomes much more flexible. So that's the five thousand fifty view on where that the, you know, use case probably be consistent. But even that probably have lot nuance underneath. So work on there Got it.

Host 1: And one last thing I don't I know hopefully gonna get here early, but we're of a b to c. I mean, thinking about it, I feel like most b... B Saas is inventory based. Like, they're like, you're getting something as a consumer or it's, like app based. Know those were like constraints just in general for our Ic today. So is that gonna be something where not we're gonna be opening up to that or, like, know we have data data warehouses, hopefully, so that's gonna hope hopefully. Hope hopefully help with like, the app component, but like, there's so many b that's like... I don't know there's b that's not app or you know, that for the most part.

Client 2: Like Yeah Well, go ahead George.

Client 8: I just say, yeah. Definitely break those into separate buckets. Media focus will be ab some digital based. And you're right the primary blocker there is data volume and transaction. So that's, like, a key piece of the twenty twenty feet map for engineering is our our infrastructure improvements be to handle that. So, like that is part of you into b c, those that's like, one of the biggest product changes that we will make in order to support it. The other ones definitely doing a lot of work on, what are the very specific features we need to be able to support other things like daily weekly reporting, like, pulling in usage based metrics or like customer like, user based metrics from data warehouse warehouses like all those things are on the road map. An order, like, effectively sound busy.

Client 2: Awesome awesome guys. Anything else with the group. I saw Selwyn, you just send me a guy. Think.

Client 4: Yeah. So One thing I would say for like calls where we start to bring in other stakeholders I've had a couple recently where you know, there's just a lot of new parties and they start to derail the conversation with things that we don't do. So just like especially when we get a prep call and we can set up like, hey, like, these are the five things that we talked about that are, like, major issues. Just pausing and preaching to your champion is just speak, hey like, look before we go too deep on this, like, Is this the problem or are these the problems. Like, we just spent the past three and a half weeks talking about how, like, your single source truth and x y and z were the they, but now we're talking about, like, benchmarking you know, salary data. Like, what are we... What are you doing here? So obviously being little nice about that, but just, like, pausing in back it up so we can re orient, notice that a little bit. With like, C metrics, we had an Hr person and then on building my inspection. That's not a Hr thing. So just, like not letting people go down the rabbit on some of these things. Too. So just just a flag for closing closing calls with new parties, like sales cycle honestly, the Hr call itself, I think is a good distinction.

Client 2: Mean we've had this several times where it's like... bench planning or work mapping or all types of stuff it's sort of related to the planning process, but aren't probably super material defiant folks. So probably good buy is a separate bucket of, like, hr people getting looped in it not just be about head count planning and you know account reporting. Like, not necessarily what those folks do as far as like, actually interfaces with the financial model time. So, yeah. That's a good on itself. I guess, I didn't one... Or or maybe Too, Have you experienced this with maybe other stakeholders because I we get to this policy from like, and rev ops teams. So just have, like, nuance use cases, but Hr to honestly sticks out the last few months of people who have kind of brought in and derailed stuff. Anyone else seem like, other personas that a good call.

Client 4: Web ops stuff to you, You know, same same thing. They're just by know, they want us to boil the oceans. Like, you we don't that's not what we do. Like, you know, And then kinda pointing back to your Cfo hear like, your your main point contact, like, Yeah. Let's let's really let's get get back on the same page here.

Client 2: Of, like, what we do and don't do well I think that we're getting, like, not that marketing people are yeah.

Host 1: Like, just marketing final stuff is always kind of like a wrench.

Client 2: Appreciate yeah. Yep Okay. Cool. Well, yeah. I mean I think Selwyn hits on the the broader strategy here we're folks the conversation leverage here bias per seven or whoever's doing that are planning reporting and kinda have that maybe speak to the focus of the use case I I I do think it's also just worth noting our tool does a lot, and it's gonna keep doing a lot. And I'll only just gonna start doing more. So this is probably an objection we're gonna take on more and more. Of the value Mosaic that we can bring out the stakeholders to sell, but I could see i and also has maybe a a outside in certain cases. So It's a good flag Selwyn. I think let's let's do that as a... you know, there's a downside navy. To some of the looping other personas. I think it's a good rule of thumb to do it. But just know that if they're looped in, we maybe should have a strategy ready refocus to conversation. I appreciate call Cool guys. Anything else with the group here Awesome, guys. Just reminder training tomorrow with without product stuff, looking forward to it. Will still Monday, we'll go through pipe and then Yeah. I mean what you guys need? Thanks
