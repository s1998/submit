Host 2: Oh, wow. Holy we cow. Well, I'm taking the time for price. Do you do you usually stay up this late?

Client 1: Yes, yes I'm it's actually we're working hours Okay.

Host 2: Wow. That's nuts. Well, thanks thanks again. And great to meet you by by way of cricket production. So will Team at tim these days were looking into building sales. For sales teams. And so put move about titles. So we might feel the data as well. So just looking to learn about the industry about different products, and i I think I found your name on G two. I think you were talking about echo there. Yeah. Just generally to heal about you and, you know, f and what you like about it you dislike and and so on in so forth. Perhaps we can kick it off please can you us little bit more about you? What what do you do? What do.

Client 1: So I work with. This is a Saas company, So we built a software And this software is for recruitment, like enterprise recruitment. Right? We provide a full module for recruitment. So I work with this company as senior business operations. Yeah What what does an operations is if executive could take do there?

Client 1: So what we do is like we on onboard customers. So the beginning of sales, like, you show the demo of the product to the customers, and we follow up with them and we also, like, take care of them, like the full support. So if they have any questions gradually, we have other meetings with them training sessions, things like that.

Host 2: So are you in charge of selling or of implementing?

Client 1: Settings just to sell.

Client 1: Implementing our software is, like in cloud. Right? So you just started try Just do it by yourself. Yeah. I mean, we provide you one session for, like, the setup. Like, if you have questions, we can while you were training. Yeah.

Host 2: And how big is the company and how big is your team?

Client 1: My team like I work with the sales team, so we have, like, close to ten people but the whole company size about seventy.

Client 1: Got it. Seventy employees.

Host 2: That makes sense. And tell me know about, how how did you find out about it in the field space?

Client 1: So in the first place, like, when our company was go growing, like, as well a start up, like, we did not use alcohol. You used to use, like, skype call and things like that. Like the old school, like, this copy paste the numbers it's so annoying. Yeah. But then we got a subscription with alcohol. Right? At first it was just one seat. Like, you know, one sharing with all of us. But then we grew up and every person had their own account. So how I know about alcohol is from the company they subscribed to it And like, alcohol has very good like interaction with Hot hubspot. So that's how we know it.

Host 2: Do you know how they found that valid? Your. They found minimum Do I know how they found about it?

Client 1: I believe like, we compare products docs. So just like, like, clients compare systems, before they want to, like, go forward with a good recruitment software. So our team like who there are some people in the marketing team who like to compare the stuff. Among multiple providers. So I I personally knew about Von age in the past. But now alcohol is up the newer version So with more integrations, I believe they found out using like comparison on Google Got it.

Host 2: Now. And and and what do you use alcohol for?

Client 1: We use Alcohol for calling our clients and like, following up with them.

Host 2: So is like, outbound or Yeah.

Client 1: Just out outbound. Yeah.

Host 2: So meaning, like, it's it's folks who haven't heard of you before and you're calling them to us if they would be interested in your solution?

Client 1: Not really. Not really. So let's say that your company interested in our software, you have a meeting. Right? After we have a meeting, you leave your number right sometime somewhere that number, we call this number because this number can also be called from Hubspot, but hap what does not allow calling from several countries. Only some countries are supported. So we bought this subscription to this call. Customers.

Host 2: Follow oh. So air only needed to dial like, I american the bills or stuff like that.

Client 1: Echo let me...

Host 2: No sorry. Hubspot. Got it.

Client 1: Yeah. Got. Top hubspot, Yes. Yeah. They let us dial only some numbers, not every number.

Host 2: Okay And Got it. In what context do you customers, how do your customers give you the funding bills?

Client 1: When they book a meeting, right? So they we ask them to questions. So we ask them their phone number as well.

Host 2: Excellent so which is optional, but we also, like...

Client 1: It's important to, like, build up that because people don't respond to emails mostly.

Host 2: Yeah. I we don't we know that field. What what do you think of vehicle?

Client 1: It's quite good. It's very... It's very good. I have as they have, like, they have multi ways to communicate. I can have an Android app I can have a app on my iphone as well. I've used that in the past, and they also have Microsoft app store. Version and also the Windows client and it is also available in Chrome So if I want to add it as a Chrome extension, it will add the if I just click to dial and super fast and super good It records the calls it locks them in my hubspot when I make a call, so it's super friendly. Yeah.

Client 1: And so what's good about No.

Host 2: Go go ahead, sir.

Client 1: What's even good about that that alcohol call is the support. So back then, we I'm using alcohol airport for over one year now. And back when I use airport, Like, there were like, so many problems experience. Like when I called sub numbers in certain countries. Like I believe, like, Argentina or there are like like, some problems. I couldn't hear the other side, and I share this with their support. So it was a very long conversation for a few weeks and finally, they fixed it so I was very happy about that.

Host 2: Yeah. Favorite about My favorite things.

Client 1: So on my on my on my Google Chrome there is a alcohol extension that helps me to, like, Like, will, like, highlight the number in green. But any phone number or any number it will highlight in green If I just click on that, it will just take that number to the app and put it to the dial. That's the best part.

Host 2: That's amazing. You mentioned that echo has, like a mobile app Windows client, a Chrome client, a web client which one of those do you use?

Client 1: I used I use the windows app. Mostly because I used to use the alcohol in my phone, but we don't do, like outbound call. It's only inbound. So it's only my working hours. Right? So I use the Windows app. That's it.

Host 2: I see. Oops What do you what do you dislike about alcohol if anything?

Client 1: That's a good question. Dislike about erica At moment, I don't have any if you if you Any any bug that's been frustrating you or anything you wish changed?

Client 1: I mean, they improved a lot recently, like, what every... In the past, like Whenever the call used to get locked in my hubspot, there was no call Id, but now I see that every call log with the call Id, and it also specified it's if it is a inbound or an outbound it's even better. I don't have to lock it manually. This is some developed they have recently done I've seen it since the last few weeks But about something bad, Yes. So I can't think of it in my mind at the moment.

Host 2: Do you do you use the mobile app?

Client 1: I used to I used to do that. And it least to be very good as well seamless, like Whether your internet connection has to be like, has to be perfect, you know? Yeah. So that you will not have any, like, voice distortion or things like that. I used to use that in the past, but I just removed it because sometimes we get calls we get calls and I mean, as we don't take calls, it gets annoying, you know, people call so remove it. Yeah.

Host 2: Have you Have you ever used audio dia done the?

Client 1: Other dialects here. I used as I shared in the beginning of the call, I used Skype Right.

Client 1: And Skype I mean, they're the best if you say Like, when you... Not about integrations, but they're the best in, like, dialing numbers because they're the first Right. These are, like, new generation things. Yeah. Like back like, ten to twelve years ago, there was only skype call yeah. But then Microsoft took over and. They mess it up a little bit I mean, a lot. Right. But because it's it's it's okay. Yeah. The call quality on Skype is good, but I think it's expensive. That's what I would say. That's why.

Host 2: You mentioned that Air records your goals. Why is that important to you?

Client 1: Yes. It is... I mean, air call does not record we want to record these calls. So I mean, it's internal policy. Right? Every company has policies. Now as we are having a meeting we are recording it. Right? For purposes. When we have meeting with clients were recorded. When we have calls with clients we recorded as well. It's for our purposes wait.

Host 2: So I don't get it does alcohol recalled, or does it not?

Client 1: I mean, alcohol records because we wanted to.

Host 2: Got it. Yeah. And why does your company want you to recall your calls?

Client 1: Because it's is see like... Now, we need to know what happened. Right? So when I'm having a conversation with the client, sometimes Maybe it's good. We wanna to know. Maybe it's not good. We wanna know. So that's why we record this call.

Host 2: So does your manager go to listen to your call recordings or or do you listen to your own colder recordings.

Client 1: I mean, I listen to my call recording some time. So I mean, what we do is when we make a call, we locked that as notes because the recording is not upfront. Right? I have to go to a link. Click on it log in and listen. So sometimes I listen to my recordings. So I recall from the past What conversation was it about. My manager, I don't think so they don't listen to it. Right.

Host 2: Did you use any sales engagement platform like cells love, so to outreach or anything like that.

Client 1: No. I don't think so. At the moment, we just use Hubspot.

Client 1: But what?

Host 2: What's the nature of the integration between habitat hubspot and and?

Client 1: The nature of the integration is that So when i make a call on Hubspot Right? So I'm calling a contact. Right? That contact he's in hubspot. Right? Because whenever I make this call, it is logged under that contact as a call. Which we used to do it in the past as a manual call logging.

Host 2: Right. Why is it important to you to love your goals in hubspot?

Client 1: Because it is important to like, maintain that client's profile. So at the end of the day, we want our clients to pay for the software. Right? They are using a trial and they pay. Right? We want to check how many instances that we have contacted How many instances we have reached out either by email or by calls? And as calling is the first priority, we want that to be logged.

Host 2: I don't get it why why do you wanna know how many times you called them?

Client 1: It's the number of engagements that we made. So let's say that How many times it took for us to close the deal, how many engagements Like sometimes it's ten, sometimes, it's twenty and sometimes it's just a few, like less than five So it will help us with reporting if I could say, That makes sense.

Host 2: So independently from What what what are your top problems right now at work?

Client 1: Top problems. So to to be precise, like, when when I... When I see? Meetings from clients. Right? So it is and engagement that helps us to close the deal. But sometimes we receive clients that our from some regions they do not show up. Right? And they're just book meetings, but never show up. Never answer because but this is a challenge So we are trying to also figure that out. By like finding what regions or locations do this the most? So that we do not promote our product in such regions. Because it's a waste of time.

Host 2: Why regions? Like, do you do you think Region is is the best predictor of notion all there other of it.

Client 1: I mean, of course, I mean, this has something to do with the marketing I'm on the decision maker here. But this is it's just a way to go about Right?

Client 1: Right. Let's say like I mean, technically, receive a lot of meetings from India. And I mean, we closed deals from India as well. But sometimes we see that people just booking a meeting. They just don't know what else to do, but they just send a book in the meeting and never show up or even the show up they just never respond and they're just gone. But I have like so many instances or experiences.

Host 2: Do you do when you're in a meeting and someone doesn't show up?

Client 1: Now we reach out first by email and in the first two minutes. And in the next three minutes. That's the first five minutes. We give them a quick call by phone? And if they still don't show up, we call them in the next fifteen minutes as well. And that's all be drop them an email? We have a sequencing in hubspot that helps us to sequence the email. That drops them an email three to four times and Once the book a meeting, the sequencing will stop three follow multiple times. To answer your question.

Host 2: And does it work?

Client 1: If it... I mean, sometimes it works, sometimes it does. Like, if a client book a meeting, but they booked it a wrong time. Right? Happens mostly with the clients. I mean, from anywhere, and we drop them an email and they don't miss they book it. Sometimes they miss it, they reply the book in the second instance. It works.

Host 2: What doesn't percentage days of the time would you say it works and what percentage of the time does someone no show and just like goes you forever. He's like talk on you.

Client 1: The no rate if I would say, like, it's It's like, a seventy thirty percent seventy percent of the time the book and they never show up and they're just gone. Yeah. But, yes, Since we moved from We because in the past, it was hubspot where we used to book meetings from. We moved from Hubspot to currently So now there are a more set of questions there. And currently has a very good integration. So the no shore rate came down. To, like, a very, very good one. You know? So it hubspot they select answer and they just booked the meeting. But in currently, the integrations are quite good. So we get less lesser no shows.

Host 2: I'm confused. What does currently do? That's reducing your initials?

Client 1: I mean, currently does not do anything to reduce our no, but what happened is, like, we we went into a new provider currently that be reset up a form which has more questions then hubspot what they didn't provide. Right? Hubspot, what did didn't provide was the integrations. I'm not sure what exactly because I already set it up. I was not the decision maker here. They were looking at currently currently was, like Like, contacted for several times, but they didn't have some feature. So we waited until they provide that to us. And when they had it, we we we got them. Yeah. So different people get different meetings Now a person who is off a lower level, like, who just started working will get users who are just like, one or two users. I mean, at the client level, but a person has been in the company for over a year, he get meetings that are of, like larger are huge big companies, something like that. This is what currently provided, but Hap doesn't have it. That makes sense.

Host 2: You mentioned your notion rate is at a good like spots right now. What what what is your current neutral rate?

Client 1: I don't have the numbers because it it depends on the whole team I usually don't pull up these reports, but If you ask me, like, I mean, I don't have that many no shows recently. Like, it could be like of the hundred percent meetings that I take, maybe the no show rate is around ten to fifteen percent it's not too bad.

Host 2: Yeah. Okay. So your problems neutral show rate. What what what does the problem do you have right there?

Client 1: I'm sorry. What was your question?

Host 2: What... So one of your problems is a neutral rate, but what other problems do you have right now?

Client 1: What other problems I think that would be the one that that that would be the one for now. Yeah. I think as Great.

Host 2: Well, I think that's pretty much all my questions about Enrique and Jebediah you have any other questions for Both?

Host 3: Correct? Prior.

Host 2: I'm sorry. What?

Host 3: Am i not... Can you guys hear me?

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. How can you with be the just two seconds Jebediah.

Host 3: Oh, sorry. You mentioned that you use the desktop app. Is that correct?

Client 1: Prayer. Yes. Yes. I used That's all i. Yes.

Host 3: Got it. And what what do you think about the desktop about?

Client 1: No. It's it's good. It's it's very good.

Host 3: Yes. Would you mind if possible, could could you share your it doesn't show us the desktop app.

Client 1: I haven't actually been to see it yet.

Host 3: That.

Client 1: You need the desktop app I can share my screen with you It.

Client 1: This is the one.

Host 3: Got it. Okay.

Host 3: I'm assuming looks very similar to this.

Client 1: Exactly. Yeah. I'm not sure if this is a desktop app or if it is the app on the, like, the Windows store. Maybe it's one or other Got it.

Host 3: Okay. No.

Client 1: This is what I used to, like call. Yeah.

Host 3: Interesting. Okay. So if you have a sequence that you need to dial through, does it support that. Or you can only just do, like, one call at a time.

Client 1: One call at a time. One call. Yeah. Yeah. They don't support...

Client 1: What you call, like, call Conference. No got it.

Client 1: If I'm am on a call, I cannot come another call.

Host 3: And right yeah.

Host 4: Curious, what do you usually do when you're in this app? So you have, like, a two do history contacts. Like, do you go to any of these sections, like, how do you usually engage with this?

Client 1: I do not have to do anything other than, like, entering the number or just going into the system and, like, like, clicking on it. So this is how it like, populates information. I. Click on it. It brings in the number on the app That's all I do.

Host 4: That. So do you ever use the history function at the bottom here?

Client 1: In keeping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Use it. Because this history function, it helps me to like like, get to the recording. So there are so many other things here. Because when I reached out to their support, I had to get the call Ids So they asked me to find the call Ids and things like that. So I had to copy each caller Id and tell them, okay, this is what is happening.

Host 3: Well, And that happened, like, quite some time ago, and they were cooperative.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 3: And so when when somebody calls that phone number, Does it ring on your desktop app and your phone at the same time?

Client 1: I... When somebody calls like now, I mean, the number that we have it's a eight eight eight number one eighty eight So they are able to call this number. Right? So sometimes what happens is any of us will get a ring here based on the availability. Here. Right?

Host 3: So I see.

Host 3: Okay.

Client 1: Yeah. I'm here with availability, like, I'm usually available all the time. Cannot set it up here because it doesn't let me do that. Because I work, I go from five Pm to two am. Right? So it doesn't let me set that But it's okay. Whenever it rings, it rings at multiple basis. If I have it here, it will ring here. It will also ring in... Inside the browser because this is another way to call So I can click here, and it will be loading here as well. I can call from here. Are here. That reads everywhere.

Host 3: Wow. Okay.

Host 2: Is that important to you that availability feature?

Client 1: What feature sorry?

Host 2: That's availability feature where you can define your your are wheels in your days of availability?

Client 1: This one I mean... I mean, yes, it should be there. Right? I mean why shouldn't it work, but I don't know why it doesn't work. Because when I set it, five Pm? Until two I can't do it. It's not possible. I mean, I mean, Google also doesn't allow me, but Yes. This is something it should be there.

Client 1: Right. It's available only for people who work during the day. This right experiment, you can do it, but this is something you can do. Maybe you can add this as a negative.

Host 2: Yeah. Great. Have you also used the web Like what's the upside for you of using the the desktop app still web app?

Client 1: Web app. I'm not sure if they have one. You really Yeah maybe they don't actually, I don't know.

Client 1: No. They don't have it. Don't have it.

Client 1: Okay.

Host 3: That was a you like log in.

Client 1: Here. Okay. Yeah. If you're... Yeah. I think I used it. Yeah. You're right. But the web app is like only for recordings, and I'm not the trader, and I do not have access. Perfect.

Host 3: Okay.

Client 1: I need to get an admin. Yeah.

Host 2: Okay?

Client 1: Great. Awesome.

Host 2: Yeah. Thank you so much both that Enrique exactly in the last questions.
