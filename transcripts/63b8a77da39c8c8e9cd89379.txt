Host 1: As long as...

Client 2: Yeah. If I need to bleep my winter or do anything. You just let me know. No no. Good.

Host 1: And I'm testing this new ai by friend who It's his start. So That's awesome. Yeah.

Client 2: How you matt. I haven't seen. Haven't... We haven't talked in a long time. Like, what yeah.

Host 1: I know. Humming. I'm sure you've been doing same. I I see you started your own business.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah. I am. I I started and I took the leap I got out of the corporate structure of staffing and recruitment and just added a partner today, actually, and we're both just trying to grow or trying to connect and and help. I'll build some winning teams out there. So It's exciting.

Host 1: What's the what is your business do?

Client 2: So I'm still in search. And and and do you prefer to me called J?

Host 1: Yeah. J m Jean marc, whatever you want.

Client 2: Yeah. That's been jean Marc. Yeah. So I have... Sorry. Smaller early stage startups with some of the more critical hires in technology. I've been kinda catering more towards the digital product domain just by nature of the professional network that we've developed. However, we're we're still capable and I'm still delivered across the board when comes to technology. So everything we do is very high touch and we definitely just let the majority of our case studies and testimony will speak for us and combined twenty years of experience in that approach. So I'm looking to connect with leaders that are somewhat like minded that do have challenges. Maybe they don't have the structure of talent acquisition in place This is where I've been having the most value and or time to hire for a given search is right around two to three weeks right now, and I'm really happy with that. So That's where we've really been focusing staff augmentation. Jean Marc is on the horizon for me. And it's capable I could ramp that up overnight, but the majority of work we do is direct time.

Host 1: Searches. Okay. What do you mean by staff segmentation? What do you mean by now?

Client 2: Contracting, hiring contractors is sometimes it's more budget friendly the contract the higher model and bringing in a, you know, two or three resources on a given project to see how they deal. Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. Very good. Oh my god. We I was I was helping out a startup about a few months back. And and they are... They are cmo o and they I forgot who they use, but they use search for. Yeah. To hire that Cmo slash director marketing, but it's really Cmo. She doesn't have the title, but but she's Cmo acting. They hired data hiring a search front from now. They're not that firm Yeah. I don't know that it's hiring Yeah. I don't know it's high right now. But... Yeah. Okay. Got it. I mean, if find... If I starts you're looking for executives, And that's both on the engineering sides all the way to the sell side, cfo and all that stuff.

Client 2: I would I would say my comfort zone is really if we look at like, the whole product come domain, job mark like product engineering the product management, software engineering design, Okay.

Client 2: Even the data engineering component, like, we've had to a tremendous run of success there and as you could agree one the technical side then.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: Absolutely. Yeah. Alright. Yeah yeah Alright. So it's tech companies looking sorts of Vp of engineering and Vp their science, Okay.

Client 2: Got it. If were...

Client 2: Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Host 1: I gonna pretty I see.

Client 2: Yeah. Like, we can we could help them in in in in the in those particular searches as well. So I say smaller companies because they're usually the ones who are looking to scale or they've had another round funding and the next step is to build the team. We come in and the that. Okay?

Host 1: Alright. Yeah. So I don't know of any company trying hire right now for the type of role. But but if I do run into any... I mean, I like to linkedin in. All I'll made the intro.

Client 2: Yeah. If anything helps, and and know the idea of us connect into is I I definitely wanna learn about you. I mean, obviously, you're doing a lot of deep trading work I would imagine at times we may be running into similar ideal clients. So kinda advocating and building this referral community in essence, like, I talked a gentleman today that is building up his design services studio and they take on more managed project service work So you know, there's opportunity. There's potential revenue sharing models. Like, it's such an open ocean being an entrepreneur. So I'm I'm here to listen and and also understand what you're doing for companies because I I'd like to help. Like to understand what that looks like.

Host 1: Yeah. You know, I've been I've been coming in the last last year's where in on the business side it could be acting Vp cells. It could be acting vp based tab, it could be sometimes they even became a ceo overall it economy depends and... But little but the but the goal was always was the same name is like, how do I get auto accelerate revenue, I go from zero to one on revenue or from one to ten depending on where they are, what they need? Do they have a client? Come sometimes pre client Sometimes I come after three clients, It it depends what chance they're having. Usually, People just know what I do, and then I get somebody says hey, Is your thirty two J am and then And then I engage in a very flexible way with them Sometimes it's it's cash plus you know, upside on the revenue that I'm able to accelerate. Sometimes it's great cash. Sometimes it's with equity, sometimes there's equity in air. I rarely do equity only deals there is one where I'm doing a a only deal just because that's That... That's what makes the most sense. But but mostly I kinda can. And then, you know, and then it's not long term, like, as long as I'm adding value and as with an I stick around and then at some point, I pass on the baton. And sometimes it's me, Like, this one I'm ramping down you know, they would want me to stay on. It like, you know, I gotta I gotta a roll off now. It's been it's been more in a year. Time for you guys too. Anyhow, so that's that's what I do across Ai startups.

Client 2: Awesome. That's exciting. So so do you represent like, your all brand professionally. Like do you have, like a, like, a like, a company representation of these services are you just word it's it's my own brand.

Host 1: I don't have a company. I might So something that might come... I might this year formal formalized like that. I'm still literally trying to figure that out. So some... So it's gonna change this here. In part where I'm wrapping down one of the contracts to enable me to change also and that'd be stuck in stuff. So it'll it'll change this here. I'm I'm literally right now. Even today or figuring out how I structure a little bit differently this year and and so so on based on the recession based on growing the business and so. So yeah. It will change, but I I kinda told you what happened the last few years. Not sure what's gonna happen the next twelve months. So what we can talk again and I'll tell you. At least what I try to execute you. I'm not even sure what I'm trying to ask execute yet. So looking that.

Client 2: Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Sorry I'm gonna fan this story So I'm not so good. So are you looking?

Client 2: Can you hear me?

Host 1: I can't hear you.

Client 2: I cannot hear then. Good. So are you working on anything right now? Like, what's keeping you busy today Yeah.

Host 1: I mean, I've got a few I've got a few a few clients I'm working with the app. Sorry. By including the one I had to be reschedule for.

Client 2: Okay. Got it. Yeah. So if I were to you know, I'm I'm networking. I'm trying to connect with leaders across different but that's Vc private equity actual founders themselves, and I talked about some of the critical hiring needs and how I can help If I'm running into to having these conversations, is there like an ideal individual that if in time was if if in my discovery, like, I would want to refer them to you. Like, what Is there a particular... Obviously Ai seems to be an area of focus but even it another a little further Who's the ideal kind of customer for you? And the services you provide.

Host 1: It's a business that's got. It's a startup up. That's funded with some level to be seen right. But some level funded that is pre revenue where it's got you know, a million dollars of revenue something now. And if it's preview, it's it's coming out with the product and saying gee. You know, I was just talking to a potential prospect and and we today, and I was like, hey. Have you thought about you know, my question is is that how you you'll get your products coming out. You got your want better clients. Okay. That's great. You want you want just people try out product, but have you figure out how you're gonna scale this? And then, you know, I'm like, are you gonna do this? This this thing. This or this or And then, you know, it's a bit... I I kinda bad him because I might He like, I don't even know you could do all these things.

Client 2: I.

Host 1: But I'm not... But you shouldn't definitely not do all them. You probably wanna do maybe a mix of a few and some more priority on one and then and, you know, later groundwork for the other because they hit at different times and it's different approach us. So you know... And then and then after that, I do another like, I'll be focusing on product protocols or... Yeah. We're doing go go. I like, he tells his that's not a vertical. That's just the category. What about their vertical? Like, are you saying you wanna try... So, you know, And and look it's not just it's not just bait that because it's real things they have to think about. Like, because One way or another...

Client 2: They need they needed.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. And look. At the end of day day, I've not even trying to get him as a client. But but my my point is, like, So so sometimes it's it's... People you know, coming in, they've worked on the product and they're like, okay. Well, now we gotta launched the product and get revenue and how do we do that? As simple as that. That there's there's a nice brewery be below that question. Or it's... You know, we got... We we got you know, a few clients they tried they do trials, maybe they do even pay trials, and then they just don't convert or they don't... Renew are Oh we got three and we're stuck at three, We can't get a fourth one, and we're banging our head. Mean, I've had different situations. Right? So yeah. Okay.

Client 2: Yeah. Alright. It's good to know.

Host 1: Yeah. It's... You know, what basically, whatever it takes to drive revenue. I'm I'm pretty cut about in terms of, like, direct and then, you know, it's interesting the business that you're in. It's I was I was talking to our a competitor view there... You know, I don't even know that name. I forgot their name was just talking to the Ceo. Just like you. I mean, he he was... He had been in the business for a long time, maybe ten years with his company, so they were little bit bigger And I was like, how how's it doing? And he's saying it was interesting? I used this was six months ago saying a lot of people are are happy to take on these variable cost versus in house recruiters.

Client 2: Yes.

Host 1: So I hope you're saying the same thing.

Client 2: So I'm still frustrated the gates, Gilmore Mark. So that's that's the by intention of trying to build this for old communities, the bottom less I need to start having more conversations with with prospect prospective clients and build case studies. I've had three or four projects since I've started which keeps me busy, but it's weird. That a lot of change in six months. For sure. But I do think for smaller boutique market consulting oriented services. There could be opportunity here because a lot of his layoffs. Of Hr people are getting right off. Yeah.

Host 1: Oh. Yeah. First to go.

Client 2: The person... Yeah. It just it is what it is. Right? We all know that. And yeah, there's a lot of companies that I'm talking to. They're like, yeah, we're just forbidden to work with anyone outside right now. We're really tied on budgets But then I have to... It's just a part of the cell, and I'm like looking at open vacancies for four months. So I'm like, are these important to your company? What's going on here? You know, if if I'm working with seven different engineers that are awesome. What am I doing to get them in front of these leaders to build some of that trust. So it's it's different My mindset, we're good. I I like we're in a good place. It's just an interesting market. And word amount is everything from you right now. That's the truth.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. So I... You know, as I as I run into you know, startups that that could use your help. I'll definitely I mean, I'll definitely make the a hard intro it's look, it just... So have you have you been through a few recessions or not?

Client 2: Not in the professional setting. Okay. So I'll just give you one data point when you're having a tough day.

Host 1: When you're having a tough day, Just remember that there's still only trillion that's been spent on It. You're in it. I mean, you're your broader category you said tech, the broader categories called It, even next year, like, there's gonna be... I don't know. You count your trillions though respect. It might be less than this year, but still gonna be trillions I respect. And so And then that's number one. Right? So even when people like, oh a recession people getting laid off and... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's still a a ton that is there is being span. That's number one. Number two, what I actually like about what you describe is those the the roles that you just describe are hard to fill They are hard to fill. Right? Yep. Who it's it's, you know, they're just hard to fill. Just hard feel... People are picky, you know, if I'm gonna start up I've raise funding and I'm at Google right now. You're gonna have to do a sales job on me to get me a switch over and jump to startup. If I didn't get let go, you know, in the next forty days. Google is gonna have layoffs in the next forty days. Try get, like like, go, then you know, you're gonna have to come in try me that's why that's right value.

Client 2: Yeah. Well... Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. Right? So you you... And then start like, you know, this is a hard they'll they'll struggle for months or two and then they'll be like you know what? We need help. This start up that hard. Same thing. Oh, then she was our network. Let's use this. They're the cheapest people in the world. I've never worked for it started that was that cheap so cheap. It's crazy. Like you would you would be like, what But that one, and then you know, after a few months or you know what we're gonna hire we're gonna hire a search fund. A such firm. And they did and they paid And they're like, yeah. But, you know, so so sometimes, you know, the these people just need a struggle on these these hard roles and then and then, you know, eventually, And the reality is most startups are gonna be in that case.

Client 2: Well you're so right. And it's it's being able to evan because it's all we don't wanna pay the fees. Usually we work on a feed. And when I I try to do and based on what you're... What you know as well, it's like we we know how freaking hard it is right now. Like like my last I had a data engineering vacancy, senior data simple. Then hide someone in five months. I'm like, why? It's... Like, well we don't pay that. Okay. Cool we know that. Like, what else was going on. And asking some of these questions, my superpower in this business is, I'd put myself top two percent on the ability to sell an employee brand make it a compelling reason and finding intrinsic motivator in the ideal candidate. That takes time. And when I in Ron started is no no offense. They were like, where there's an issue in the staffing world is there's just such a negative stigma and everyone's metrics driven and stacking residential, but they'll go, we're like, the partner and I, we just fundamentally know that there doesn't really work. I usually work on an engaged format which is a buy in from whoever's working with me. And it gives me some flexibility. Like, look, I I'm fine gaining some trust in reducing that fee to prove Let me do. But I need to know that there's vehicle commitment because that indicates the return on your investment because it really is less you know. So it's it's bringing that to life Jericho Mark and that's But when I get people on the phone in the conversation, like, that's when my passion and my case studies is It's getting to that point. So...

Host 1: So you I think you'll have your you know, you'll have to where I've seen Are you working with any investor?

Client 2: No. Everything I do is directly through...

Host 1: You you got you you you have to put that is one use strategic goals for this year. Yeah. Like, quality their goal. Yeah. Like you know what? They matter. If I get revenue out of that relationship, I need to establish that relationship So it's gonna be call if you have to say, and with with a decent Vc And I don't have to be over it's. It doesn't have to be first cat. First round, that have to be these guys. But it's gotta be one. What what what's the decent Dc a Vc is making at least some investments. Right? Not only issues that that's on this sideline. Relationship that one every five star that they invest in where they can't find that role that Ct role. Or that Vp vpn engineer where there's, like, a business person in a Cto and they're like, yeah, but know that cto is really good at data size, but cannot for like build product ready, production ready products. Right. No way. Well, I need to get a Vp engineering and they'll let that two executive founders struggle for three months. I'll say, you know, you're wasting. Like, I gave you money, like, you guys gotta accelerate your business here. Alright. You know, Enrique commit. It done. Yeah. So So that's... You you have you got a find one like that. So that And yeah. The tricky side is you gotta avoid those that have there their support teams So like, there's even some small vcs have built this support teams and they have that Hr partner are that does that roll, but there's some I haven't and won't. Not their model. They're more classic.

Client 2: Yeah. Is that like what we would call, like, because I'm the the Vc were like, the operating partners if you will or the extension of okay, now this particular director is responsible for strategic hiring and other elements of that business or is it... Because I guess where At... I've seen in B like, there's like there's venture capital individuals is then like particular departments that I should be talking to. With it. Is that what you're seeing or is you think it's not as complicated as that?

Host 1: As a Vc front, Yeah.

Host 1: No. So I love you see fun, they they have one two two and a half structures. Alright. So they have two structures and then on two, there's two eight to be... I So one is got my investment professionals I got a junior principal, a partner a Gp general partner And they're all involved somewhat at the investment decision. Some sourcing Some is due diligence. Some is making the investment decision. Some is fundraising have more funds from the Lps But it's they're all part of the investment team. So that's the classic model. That's what you think of Vc seats. What interest already started maybe five or ten years ago and they said, You know what? Next to this. We got an investment team with sort of the pyramid. Next this we'll create a support and we're gonna have three expert business deaf people, three experts legal people three experts, Hr people and three expert finance people. And then as we invest as the investor I started they said, oh, we're gonna give you money, but we're gonna give you all this support. We got experts on payroll, week of a Bd sales finances one. Right? Oh, in sales, of course, itself. Right. Not the be one. Sales. Right? We got all these people that gonna come and support you not just give you five hundred bucks, we'll give final box plus this t that are on twenty four seven on call. The problem with those Vc funds that I have created this support team that is on payroll for them. Is D team is a straight on the direct competitor for you. And I think it would be it's not impossible, but it's not a lay to say, even though they have expert hr people on They'll they'll wanna hire a search one. Search group. Is not impossible because usually, sometimes D hr people are like, expert at building the culture in the company or hr policy not so much recruiting. I don't know. You... That one's like case by case.

Client 2: Yeah. But one thing that sure is, So that was...

Host 1: You... I I told the one which is class eight two a, which is like, I've got my whole fa a b d, like, finance and charge on. There's also two, which is I'm not a because of fun as interest orbits. I maybe have an expert in marketing I maybe have an expert in finance. I don't have a insurance staff I don't have experts on staff. So they have some support functions for whatever reason, but they don't have Hr. And so you could you could say, you know, go plug those in and say, hey, I'm your captive. Into our partner here, Not partner is partner to fund by partnership, and if you need an easy just call me up. And I'll come do presentations, it's about best practices to how to recruit to your portfolio for free And even with that when they struggle all they're hire us to get it done. Right. Right? But I'll I'll I'll be here that I say what's the best when a fire higher and so on and Yeah.

Client 2: That's the consulting element of what my business is to. Right like the poor branding and stuff it's, like, building a foundational process that could include a couple critical hires, but hopefully is adopted. Like that it breaks a full circle for me And... But yeah. It's relatively be doing man. I I used to do fortune fifty tech hiring and staffing solutions. So this is new water for me I so no, like, what I know is like, that's the back It's for those early stage companies.

Client 2: So it's finding a way to Yeah.

Host 1: Right still... Yeah know, the one thing you can do. So if you already have a few clients under the bell, The put portfolio the the companies will talk to each other within the portfolio. So if I have... If I'm a startup up, and I'm the Ceo founder. I mean, this is at the Founders level or the c level. Like, it's it's Right. One or two executives in the company. We'll talk to the other executives, at some of the other starts in our portfolio. Why is that? Because the on puts up these events.

Client 2: This.

Host 1: Plenty your companies coming over for a day. We'll do this one hour on sales. One hour marketing one hour? What's the market evaluations doing. But I this started of that. And so then there's a get together doing instance. And and then And then... But when they do that, they only invite, like, one or two executives like this you other the founder or the Cto. But those does have that network that's been built for free for them because they get invited to these events. Yeah. So you have one client and it's it is higher. It's at the top, or you can close, you're like, hey, can you make an intro to that portfolio company and then start to hop hop hop.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: That's great.

Client 2: That's really helpful and super...

Host 1: Because that relationship. And then look if you If you've helped them, tire. It's pretty it's pretty easy to say that was a win. They'll be happy to make the because they'll be like, look, I vetted this service. They solve the pain point for me, if you have this pain point, use them. Like, it's it's like there's so much it's the inch true it's a warm intro it's a reference at the same time. It's like there's so much going on with that email. So so that's a really good thing. And then you just... And then you start hopping. Right? Then usually they have several investors. So they might have several groups.

Client 2: Yeah. Yeah.

Host 1: So lots to ponder.

Client 2: Opportunity for sure.

Host 1: Yeah. So like, if I hear if I hear any It looks pretty clear what you guys offer. If I hear of people not that are looking then they don't keep you posted for sure.

Client 2: Yeah. Absolutely. That's important to. Right? We're all trying to help each other out in this...

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah yeah. Twenty so there's elements of...

Client 2: We can always talk about that. Obviously, we're trying to build one block at sign here. With the right really one logo at of time with the right people So that would be super helpful I knew that you would you would be an amazing contact to reconnect with. And obviously, you're staying busy and you're doing a lot of great things and and same thing applies. Right? Like because I'm starting to talk to individuals that having any element of strategy and revenue generation and acceleration that is a part of their overall total company strategy like I'm gonna challenge.

Host 1: It's usually a challenge that pain sales. Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: So if you may, you know, other the I'm I'm not I'm selling aspirin. You know, Right Like Yeah vitamins.
