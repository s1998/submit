Client 2: Up to you, yeah. You know how to do this just yet. We can Alright. We recommend the apps that that thing that is should pops up after I you meeting. That's a better thing that's slack basically.

Host 1: Alright. Is there is it like a chrome extension that I in... Or is it all something I downloaded my desk so It's it's a thing you done not feel desktop.

Client 2: Okay. What do you think of that?

Host 1: I I mean, I like from extensions, so I don't have to download anything. It'll just add it to my chrome, and it I don't gotta worry about this situation but I'm fine with it. Like, I do vid here I know a video is good. They have a chrome extension, but they also asked to download if you want to something with Zoom. I don't have to do this stuff. But I do it Yeah.

Client 2: There reason why it can be a prone extension is that the C extension wouldn't be able to play it's self until meeting. Right. Will only be able to pick itself in google meet meeting because Zoom is outside of Chrome.

Host 1: Okay. So fire flies, I do have chrome. I don't... I don't I don't went adam Chrome and I don't have a desktop. So fire is going into my Zoom without anything Yes.

Client 2: We can also do that but we wouldn't able to up the life after you meeting.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: The thing I'm noticing using was that this thing is six hundred and seventy megs. It's it... I I it's not good well, We're gonna make it to that later.

Host 1: Yeah. It's taking quite a long time.

Client 2: It's taking a long time.

Host 1: So i think the the only thing that I'm not gonna like. Is that it's on my desktop. You know, rather than, like, Scratch pad is just in my browser here. So it's nice. You know, I can just navigate into a different things.

Client 2: This thing.

Client 2: It's that it's on my desktop.

Host 1: You know, it's just... It's just in my desktop versus number browser that's it.

Client 2: And so that's super useful for feedback. The thing is that when we are you know, the stuff, we can do so much more i feel like a better experience. So it's a little bit more like an upfront gust. It's a one time thing, but then it's just a better experience after for that. What you think that is it real fit for you? So for example, the kind of weather experience is like site that pops up we can do virtual stack basically.

Host 1: The question is Is it a better experience in my desktop versus the browser?

Client 2: It is. Yeah. Like, again, the site for example something we can't do in your browser. Popping up this thing automatically after you meeting. Just go do that in your browser.

Host 1: Okay. Right. I mean, it would be better my browser.

Client 2: Okay? That is used Feedback.

Host 1: I mean, I've zoom here Right? In Zoom, I never open it. You know, because I don't need to open on my desktop. Although I can if I want to. Right? And Zoom probably likes that I have this on my desktop because it improves the experiences in some way, but I mean, I never opened it. And it and it does its thing without me needing to open it. So, like, which is not part of how manage apps typically. But that's okay. Like my notes, I'm always opening my notes So it's not like I'm ave avert tour using new screens on my desktop.

Client 2: Yeah. Know. It will work without desktop path. But it's it's it's a better experience with it. That's the second set.

Client 2: Soogrim You... Yeah. I just sent an email to the engineers like this shouldn't be Six hundred megs. Those are wheel, well it's like, fifty megs. Was create again so I see what the the install process looks like it says my screen sharing k.

Client 2: You'll just sharing you browser. So I can't see the rest. Like I can't see what's happening. Okay.

Host 1: I just get done and then I guess what's what's next to open this?

Host 1: Okay. I'm sure nothing will go wrong. I mean, if something we're like, I... you know, I don't want to join a meeting. Where do I tell it not to?

Client 2: You but... Yeah. You remove them. You click on the trash next to Google calendar there? And to do it.

Host 1: I see I have to trash everything. I can't, like, choose meetings You would only do that?

Host 1: So Fire allows me to do that. It's like a little toggle button.

Host 1: And I already any any meeting that's my own domain and it will automatically not join, and then it'll it'll toggle it on and off. So that would be amazing. You know, it's like Like, I don't want to join this blog podcast. It's internal it's not a sales meeting. It's internal meeting So you know, when you know and Fire because you're using it. Right?
