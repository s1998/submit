Client 1: Paul. How's it going?

Client 2: Hold Just the meeting recorder, so far.

Client 2: User. Slow day.

Client 1: Oh good. They just got off. I was on a Zoom call with Chase who's over with all the twelve brands. They have like, blender bottle and a wall and a whisk He can't he can't get in and switch stores when he logs in. So we were trying to troubleshoot it in real time.

Client 2: You can't get. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.

Client 1: We also had an issue where they've been getting some orders where order protection is there twice. So check this out. I'll show you how this works. This this is how I was able to to duplicate the issue I'll go shopping. I'll pick this bottle add it to my cart. So right now it's what you'd expect. Like, you can to talk about on or not, so I will right now it's either on or off. Right? There's no quantity and when I check out, and I see the the middle check screen, also just hard coded. You got one bottle, one order protection. So everywhere you look, it looks like it should be. But if I go back to the cart, it loads the full cart Again, what you'd expect is the on or off. But if I start changing the quantity, boom, order protection is hidden, you can now change the quantity here. Because order protection pops up at the top of the list. Like the first time I did this, I was clicking up up up on the bottles. And order protection showed up and when I clicked up, it was changing the quantity of order protection. If I keep moving forward in this regard, it's gonna have know, four order protections in, So I think that's what's happening.

Client 1: I think it's think it's when the customer goes back to this card and they're... Like, again, it's always hidden default but as soon as you change quantity, order protection shows up. And so we... I gotta figure out if there's a way we can or it again or just lock it to one or maybe there's a setting in Shopify where you can have inventory and only allow, like, one to be added an order a time. Like there's probably a few ways we could approach it. But, you know, our first thing is let's make sure we're not accidentally charging them twice, and I don't think we are. I think it's because of this.

Client 2: So it's it's kinda funny that people are Like, they want protecting enough where they'll actually buy protection per order per item.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 1: And so what I what I don't know is were they clicking the change in that showed up and the then i click and didn't fix it, or are they like, oh, I've got two bottles. I need to have two protections, you know.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Is where if they have full story that would be really interesting to watch, Like see the order go back and play it. And to see if, like, either they're interacting with it or if it was just like, ina burton Sounds like we're go.

Client 2: On on full story. So it's exciting.

Client 1: Yeah. Let was let let's us see it on our side, but like, we wouldn't be able to see this one because you know, Oh, while would have to add it to their page, Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Sorry. Getting my head out of this website. Being terrible, not paying attention.

Client 1: Okay. The.

Client 1: And for our for nonprofit, they said that we can get the basic for free So they have free mini basic pro. The basic one is fifteen bucks a month.

Client 2: Oh that's nice So that's pretty sweet.

Client 1: So I'm gonna take a look and see how involved it is to get a running, you know, versus the card one that's probably a little bit cleaner gone straight in. But if I can get the power of frame, for free, could be pretty cool. But I also paid seventeen bucks per card and it's like unlimited sites, you know, And I'm like, yeah, that's already pretty good too. So i'll I I'll have to play around and see which one I go with.

Client 2: Yeah. As long as you can find a good template from kramer, then I think you'd be in a good spot I mean, it sounds like you got the chops to do it. You know, it just Yeah. It depends on how detailed do you wanna go, but definitely more flexibility. No question about it. I've been... I've been honestly shocked by, like, I still am like, even today, like, I was really worried about it is. To be honest. Had all the the mobile. Like, I kinda just have made some assumptions about how things would work, and then I set it up in, like, a way that would be like, you know, components similar to to fig my and it really not a a positive result. Like, I I i I basically Tablets got some more to go, But I basically finished mobile like, super super fast. Just things to all their, like, different, you know, break point structures and having things in components it, like applies across all the pages. So Yeah. It's it's been a good day for me.

Client 1: That's cool.

Client 2: User. Well, I know Jericho declined and have not heard from Harrison Good stuff. You wanna go over?

Client 1: The one thing I was gonna communicate if we had the call was that I wanted to put a code freeze in place for least a day. We've got so much stuff going on that it's we're making it to where we can't get everything merged cleanly. Like, right now, I tried to spend some time to Hawke in this morning to merge in the magenta changes into it our main branch.

Client 1: Yeah. Koi last night pushed out a huge update to all of our user roles and permissions. He tried it the night before but things weren't working. So we we rolled it back. Rolled it out again last night, and we spent a couple hours in the during the night kinda working through at getting things fixed and it's in pretty good shade as a couple little bugs left I need to work through. But but now, I mean, that touched so many files because it's everywhere we have stuff he had to put in the new logic. And so when we look at the code in what he did, there's, like, merge conflicts in, like, forty files. And was going through and I just watched him, like, this one looks good to keep what was there all this one we should probably keep the other one and, like, it's a guessing game. And I'm like, no, we we can't do this. Like, i think I need to have Coy merge this because Coin knows what he did.

Client 2: And he'll go recognize what's different about Mag.

Client 1: And, I mean, crap man we're we're so far out of sync but where we were when they started that work and where we are now that, like, I don't know how we get it in and have it work. I mean, we're gonna have to rec code a bunch of it. And so Every everyday we're checking in code code code code code grow girl grow. Hawke got his stuff put into staging, but not our main branch. So like the disparity is so huge now that everything is a massive conflict we we've gotta stop bringing in new get everything out stabilized and then to start moving forward. And so it's gonna go a little bit against what. Jericho and Harrison hoping for which is new output. But like right now, everything's conflicting. We're causing bugs we're causing, we're losing stuff and we've got to get that straightened up first before we go any further. So I think it's literally like one day and just banging through it and then throwing our stage environment away bringing over the main branch and saying, cool. We're in parity now. Is what it is. And now let's go test everything and make sure it all works. So That's what I'm day is not bad.

Client 2: I'm sure that's on a hard sell at all of gonna mean efficiency. So Yeah.

Client 1: It's at least a day maybe too, but I think it's a day So, yeah. Right now, I'm just waiting for Quite to wake up. It's three in the morning there. So As soon as he's online, I'm just gonna say, hey, let's just pair up man. Let's let's figure this out. Let's get it merged. Because we're gonna lose a lot of his changes and we're gonna lose a lot Mag and both of those are gonna be really unfortunate because there's like, so many moving parts to both of them so but I can I can send message in Slack, like if they don't join Okay.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Yeah. I mean, that includes seem like a huge deal. So I mean, the thing for efficiency or two days or Whatever it is to get everything synced up seems very reasonable to me so imagine that. They have a problem with that. Yeah. What else?

Client 1: It's the main thing. Think. I trained Rachel yesterday on how to go in and create tickets for onboarding new customers. Show the process to got her access to everything. And so what that'll mean is when we have new doors, like, normally, Rachel would do a bunch of things and then hand it over to me I'd go create stuff for the developers gets stuff out of our legal documents and paste and stuff and assign it to a developer, and then it was kind of... I was kind of the middle man. And so I've been able to get things to a place where we have a process. And so I train her and she can just go from a to z. She can she sees that it's done. She can go up all the stuff get it to the developer and he knows when to handle it. We have a new Slack channel for it when he updates it ticket it she gets the alert and can let the customer know and contest it. So that's a pretty exciting day. It's it's like a small part of what I've been doing, but it's still something that I've had to manually keep an eye on.

Client 2: That now can on its own, which is pretty exciting.

Client 1: So that was was one of my wins yesterday.

Client 2: Fantastic. That sounds great. Anything with the word process and is lovely been to my ear.

Client 2: So Yep.

Client 2: Fantastic. So don't actually know that I fully understand rachel's like, the entirety of her role. Like, Can you give me the break breakdown one two three, because it it seems like you got hand a few things.

Client 1: Yeah. I don't know the full scope either, but I know that she was hard to do a lot of, like, analysts stuff. So she's the one that's been creating all the dashboards and helping us know that data.

Client 1: I know that she's Jericho Sister.

Client 2: Okay.

Client 1: So there's a family connection there. So, yeah. She's been helping. I I think she's wearing multiple hats. So it's like, hey, help us get an idea of what's going on set up these dashboards get things going. If actually he's done with a dashboard now that we're gonna replace the analytics tab with. Which, by the way, let me show you this. You share my screen again. Learned another thing about our code So when you look underneath analytics This one, I think you're supposed to pick a store first now you're supposed to see you know, analytics for that store like, how many claims there are and the types like It's funny that you have this one, like, here's the city's your issue are coming from.

Client 1: Oh, durant.

Client 1: You know, anyway, is what it is, but then you go to store performance, And i I was just noticing last night when I was testing all the roles and this was failing. Works for the admin account that we all share. I don't know if I'm gonna to work on my brain from when I might have to log out and log in as admin. This is a cumulative report about all stores. So notice here says store plural and then at store here. And so I think that was something at some point, they're like, oh, this is stores So all the all the different store users can see this, but when they open it, it just gives them an error. And so they're not supposed to see this. I don't think. So I'm I'm gonna have it remove this from their view. But if this is for order protection users, and it's let us know about all the stores, and it really maybe shouldn't belong. I don't know. That's the thing like we're mixing state of what store do and what we see in do, You know what I mean?

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Because here if I don't think it matters with store you're on it. It's gonna try to load it for everybody. We get that error. So if I go back in as admin, Here we go. Well, ma'am, we hit our fiftieth fifty thousand order protected today.

Host 3: Hey.

Client 1: Who joined us Oh, Just enter.

Client 1: Yeah. Hear.

Client 2: Don't don't don't don't don't say just. But just enter.

Client 1: The Topper. So that's pretty cool. Like, look at the correlation. Fifty thousand orders, five million dollars in revenue protected. So you can do the math there. For every ten thousand orders, we have a million dollars of protected revenue. We can kinda see some pretty good averages there. But... yeah. This what I trying to figure out because we were getting the air. I was like, oh, well, should stores be getting this or not, it looks like we're we're showing this for all stores and they're ranking.

Client 2: Yes. Is definitely internal. Google battles. Also was in this, it doesn't even matter what store selected.

Client 1: It just shows everybody which is kind of fun, whereas here, you've gotta to have a specific store selected or it won't work. So many things are mixed date. So I was tempted to move store performance down underneath this when we have our sub menus for like, macros and users and stuff we could even put like, store performance because it's only us that sees it. And then analytics can just be its own standalone item here that's the new meta based dashboard that'll go in.

Client 2: Mh I was even wondering do we even need to have a separation here of like, billing and payouts or should we just bring these top level.

Client 1: So we have the claims which you're you know, there are multiple types of claims. All orders we talked about pulling outside of that and not even showing it to the stores. We can see it.

Client 1: But it doesn't like, give the stores that concern that we're seeing other stuff. So we'd have claims with new open approved denied. And the next would have, like all orders, and then we could have just analytics and then we can have billing and payouts and settings. Like, I we probably have enough screen real estate to where we can just have all those top level. Then underneath admin settings we can have... users, macros, start performance, stores like we could have that table where we can go and create new ones and like that.

Client 2: Mh.

Client 1: Anyway, that was the latest in my thinking.

Client 2: Yeah. Makes sense.

Client 1: Because the store to go at analytics analytics, if that's the only one they see and kind of an unnecessary it's hierarchy. Right?

Client 2: The store... Like, if I'm logged this user, I can't see the storage performance tab. Right?

Client 1: They see it, but when they load it, it does this for a while then comes back and says there's no data to show. So they... They're actually seeing doesn't do anything.

Client 2: Gotcha gotcha Okay. I'm mean you're not speaking notes something.

Client 1: And we have the new meta based dashboard that's gonna replace this anyway. So this is going away.

Client 2: I gotta check out the new dashboard. Actually. I'm look at.

Client 1: Haven't spent very much time in it. This is what it looks like I can send you a link So for us, you know, we can change the store and and look at different things. When they get it, this will not be visible, but they also still have the date filter where they can change it if they want. So here we're viewing Arm So you see when they went live, all the claims that have been reimbursed, attachment rates, claims claim approval rate, total store claims, value of claims managed, Yeah.

Client 1: So this is definitely like leaps and bounds ahead. This will be interesting when people see this here like, oh, why did this take sixty hours? You know, it's... you know, at the time we didn't have twenty four seven support and, like, getting into groups in but we should see this only get better over time. Like, we can definitely improve this. We don't need to have hundreds of an hour shown, you know? Probably We have when did we launch twenty percent so?

Client 2: This is December lunch course so he'll got in November was probably by end November.

Host 3: We yeah we launched like, mid November.

Client 2: Than the clear.

Client 2: What?

Host 3: No. That doesn't make sense. Which This is for Amr. Yeah. It says December there. That's weird. Let's go a look at that.

Client 1: It December six b.

Client 2: We should probably look at a few folks before we launch with this chart make sure this doesn't look Like a median resolution time is kinda nice, but this chart is like, a little Yeah.

Client 1: Let's at this. Oh, I don't want armor though. This one's gonna look horrendous because they don't let us manage their claims. They sit there forever. Oh, is that because... I guess if you don't ever resolve plane then there's no Yeah.

Host 3: There's no resolution.

Client 1: See that one, like, having fractions of an hour. Like this is one point one hour. Probably should do a little bit more logic here where it's like at a minimum we show a certain thing and that would look tiny, you know, I guess if we're not resolving claims then it doesn't look bad, so that's good to know.

Host 3: Let's go to Let's go to copper. Want my accounts to see if they Oh, yeah.

Client 1: December fifteenth.

Host 3: A hundred eight hours.

Client 2: It's not good.

Host 3: No. This is bad.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 3: But then Yeah, The average Yeah. I mean, but look at it now it's like twenty minutes. Ten minutes.

Client 1: Yeah.

Host 3: That's crazy. So you just exclude all the the outliers here.

Host 3: Yeah. That's the issue with averages. Right, doing Average resolution time, like, those outliers they're off Yeah.

Client 1: We can say what's getting new processes in place. We had couple... Like, we had a couple of bugs in the in the queue, right, that we could action for a day or something.

Host 3: Yeah. That's satin open for too long.

Client 1: Yeah. Because they weren't moving where they were supposed to. And so it made it It seemed like it was longer than it really was.

Client 1: Right.

Client 2: Or maybe we just start this in twenty twenty three for now, Yeah. The chart I was like That's true.

Client 1: Yeah. This is naturally gonna Right.

Client 1: Like, if we... I mean, what happens if we do, like, a hundred days?

Client 2: Don't know if there's a big benefit that I'm seeing Avid resolution time by day. Is there? Like, the canadian and resolute... Like, that seems like the metric. This just seems like it's gonna bring up questions and problems. Why did you guys take long on this day. What happened on this one? What? You know? It's just like or average time.

Client 1: Oh, you yeah. And you meet... You didn't need your Sla. So, you know, Yeah.

Client 2: Now or whatever. Right? I mean, You installed...

Client 1: That's a good point. Maybe, like, we look at this. But maybe I mean, maybe once we're in a little more of a flow in the default thirty one days or whatever is is clean.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. But even having this, like... And and i might be nice to say, mean doing it in hours, is nice. But what's like point zero five of an hour. Five minutes.

Client 2: Yeah. Something like that. It'd be nice to just show in minutes.

Client 2: Yeah.

Client 1: Say might be good if it's if it's less than one to just say you know, time in minutes, but this is good.

Client 2: You do you wanna play that rachel? Or do you want me to send her a note?

Client 1: Yeah, either way. I can throw out to her. We're working on this integration anyway.

Client 2: Yeah. Let me I I can send her out here.

Client 2: I the database.

Host 3: What is it? I can I can send her no.

Client 2: Oh merchant facing. I got it.

Host 3: Okay.

Client 2: I got it.

Client 1: Yeah. There's four dashboards that are all that she created.

Client 2: Anyway. But I don't have access to the clients maybe merchant facing dashboard burning it. Alright. Here we go. Do you guys have like, a channel usually tablet rachel in?

Client 1: This is the right here.

Client 2: I just senator directly.

Client 1: So the difference here she did one that showed rev share and one that didn't where everything's based on the Id of the store. The other one's is the same. There's a rev sharing a non rev version with the name. just it know what we need to be able to establish the the embedding And so I'm gonna use the one that has the name for now. Just so that when we embed it, we can see if it's working as we switch between the stores. Then once we know it's working I'll hide the store. So all four of them are are technically the same. And and Harrison said don't the rev share one, It's too confusing to explain to them. What the rev share is and why one's different than another, you know because we will reimburse at one's higher of the two You know, this reminds me of product all them.

Client 2: Have you, sort of around It's like It's it's pretty cool.

Client 2: I. I don't wonder. I gotta Haven't used them since, like earlier this year company We're working with. Use them. Yeah. A mural acquired them Know me send it in the chat. It's basically meant for like, more casual working. Like, if you're just like, working with someone and on a call, you can, like, minimize them. You can have, like, shared background music from your computer from you know, one of their predefined playlists or the little clap emojis that'll send things on your screen and was pretty cool when I was using it, like, for, like, longer sessions. Like, if you're ever doing, like, you know, whatever it is. Few hours with someone for whatever reason. Like you you know, Brian you may and your jam Hawke for quite a while, It's it's a pretty pleasant thing. I I mean, it was free. For a while, but i definitely recommend it.

Client 1: That's cool. that's great. Hey, Rachel. Thanks for Joining.

Client 4: Yeah no problem what's up.

Client 1: We're just looking at the new dash forward and kinda talking through it, and we had some feedback I thought. Let's just have you join us in real time.

Client 4: Totally works we just picked one the no rev share, because that's what we're planning to implement right now.

Client 1: We were taking a look at this for some different customers. So the two initial items back we had were We're wondering if maybe we don't include this bottom graph for the customers for now.

Client 1: Mostly, right now where we were working through. It was it was like December when we really got to twenty four hour claims that all of them are gonna have a big bike on, like, the fifteenth or sixteenth of the December where it looks pretty bad, it should it should start to level off and some of the other brands we looked at. It's like five minutes is the average now. So one we thought about maybe hiding this and not adding in like a potential confusion or contention point. The other one was all of these that we've seen so far are, like, zero point zero something. And so we're wondering if we should just do this in minute where it's like average is five minutes or seven minutes or something like that.

Client 4: Totally. That's good that we're seeing them that way. I think that's, you know, even like, three, four weeks ago when I made back, it was made more sense to do it in. That we're seeing that. That's easy change. So What are some of our other big brands Mean, we have so many new guys.

Client 4: You can look at, like, what a wall is looks like.

Client 1: Point one.

Client 4: Point one three.

Client 2: I'm I'm not gonna at not. But be pretty cool to show, like, eight minutes. Maybe even can move this up to the top. Like, I feel like that's like a or like like, somewhere higher. It's like your customers are getting back eight minutes.

Client 2: Yeah. You know, Like not their...

Host 3: Their claim is being resolved of in eight minutes. That's insane.

Client 2: Right.

Host 3: Just a give you perspective at one point routes was, like a week.

Client 2: Oh, i I forgot to post you guys. We just did I didn't order a couple weeks back to file a claim with road. And we finally we could file a claim, but we didn't get it. Took them an hour and a half to get back. So That was the fun last night Oh, really?

Client 1: Damn. Here we went live you know, here's the claims reimbursed average response time, attachment rates, I don't know how we're calculating that. Is that like it came in and within five minutes. We already response or is it, like, from the time it came in we did a thing and it waited in their court, and that's not counting against it. So like, is that just the time it sits in our you or how how do we get to this number?

Client 4: Oh, it is the resolution date minus the timestamp stamp of the time that the claim was submitted at. So we have a time.

Client 4: And then we subtract the submitted date from that.

Client 1: It almost seems too too short.

Client 4: Well, we spectrum customers saying the same thing they were like, can you take a little bit longer, please?

Client 2: Like give me questions when question the bad metrics, Brian, Not the good ones.

Client 1: Right till you find something then i'll sudden looks bad again.

Client 1: You're like, oh, they were used to what it looked better.

Client 2: A few of those moments.

Client 4: Yes.

Client 1: We should be pressing to see minutes and this one maybe just hiding for now.

Client 4: Will you go back to arm quick, I just wanna make sure this minutes calculation is accurate. Nine Cool. Okay. Yeah. That's I just change that.

Client 4: I'm just gonna say it as a new question so that I we're some reason. We wanted to hours one someday, we can still have it in I don't discovery. Right?

Host 3: Yeah. That's great.

Client 1: Is it gonna go on the same folder with these other ones?

Client 4: Yes. Okay.

Client 1: Me when it's there, and then I'll show you what we do to embed it. K.

Client 4: Yeah.

Host 3: I'd like to see actually what you guys do to embed it.

Client 1: Part of it, I can't show because we've got add code to the back end. That is able to generate Json Web tokens, and then there's the code on the front end that pulls the definition. So I at least was able to get the main things put in here. Why? Okay. Yeah. So I have on... We replace the analytics. We wanna use the signed embedding option from their documentation. And it goes through... They had a different method, but this is one it look like we want. So it goes them how to do it? And then I said you wanna pass the store's Id as a parameter to get the right store, make sure we cancel switch to other stores.

Client 1: And I said we wanna make sure it's size correctly by default that looks like it's a static thing, but you can put code in to change it. Then here's the code that goes into the server like, on the back end to do these Json web tokens, and then there's the finance grip that pulls it. So I'll i have to update this based on the new, you know, dashboard that Rachel's creating.

Host 3: That's almost wanted they go through it together.

Client 1: And nick can show you.

Client 4: Okay. Minutes should be on there now. Let me just test a couple. Just make sure that the mask looks good Just I put it on the dashboard, you can go through it too if you want.

Client 1: So is there gonna be a new one that shows up here or is it within one of these?

Client 4: It's within the one you're just not the store name, no rep share.

Client 1: Okay.

Client 4: I I left the hours and on there just real quick for me to just, like, look at the two compared to each other.

Client 1: I see.

Client 4: I need to capitalize the word time.

Client 1: Kinda funny. I'm always in my mind life. Do I capitalize the end do I not? So there's this Is this website called capitalize my title, there's all different standards. But I just use the default one So I'll go median time to resolution. For claims or whatever Need to work put in in there.

Client 1: And then so I'm like, okay. Cool. That's how it is. So I'm like, okay. Copy. Go back, and then I might consistent according to at least some standard So that's my little act for how to capitalize titles.

Client 1: In my last company, they had a thing where it was all sentence case. So you only ever capitalized word anyway. So that made it kinda easy, but it broke my brain for I was so used to capitalizing everything. So... Oh, yeah.

Client 4: Okay. So I'm move that chart by day, Unless we want... Well? No. Yeah. I'm just gonna remove it.

Client 1: And where it's minutes, we could probably only need one decimal I don't know. And that's it. Unless you like having that. So that would be four point six, which is still pretty dang fast.

Client 4: And even I don't know if we need the precision of two decimal on that.

Client 1: Yeah.

Host 3: Yeah. That's true I am gonna remove the hours on there.

Client 4: Please okay you can refresh and it should be. The chart should be gone and that should just be one decimal, please.

Client 1: Nice. Cool. So, yeah, what I do is up here in the top right, you've got the sharing link.

Client 4: Mh we click on that.

Client 1: And first of all, you say enable and then, you know, you can do a public link. You can do a public embed. But in our case, we're wanting to put it in side of an application or a dashboard And so when you click into that, you have all these options. So you'll notice that by default, it has this little thin border around the outside. We're we're putting it into an existing Ui I thought, okay. We don't need the border because it's already gonna be within other things. Then it has title, which is this at top And so I didn't think that they needed to have that.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: So now you can choose light darker transparent it's kinda cool. Like, if you had some kind of other colors or things, it'll actually just make the whole background transparent. Of course, we can support dark mode, which is probably just a parameter it passes. And so when we get to where we have dark mode available we'll probably just get this code, and we'll be able to pass whichever one we want. But for right now, because we're all light mode, I left that. Course you can choose your font. And then these filters up top, you have the store filter in the date. You can see that both are set to editable. And so I did that on purpose while we were testing. Eventually, we can say that it's locked so they can't change it. So if we only wanted to let them like have thirty one days and ever change it we could lock it. Or in the case of store, like, if you disable it, it it just disappears and it's not there. It's there for us. Like, on the admin side, but when it comes to embedding it, it won't show up. So my intent is to leave this there for now so that we can see if when we load on on a certain store's page if it's the right store that's displayed once we have the comfort level with that, then we'll come here and we'll either lock or disable the store filter because it's not relevant. They log in. They just assume it's them. Right? So here they can change the date. Once that's all done, you can hit publish and then this is the code that you put on the back end. And then here's the code you put on the front end. But then there's also other tokens you can pass as well like here's the store Id or here's the session or here's the date filter. You can see some of that like, border faults, the title falls, we're getting the token in with, you know, we have our key that we're gonna pass. So anyway, that's that's what I figured out so far. You can actually tell at which language these are actually did Js x for ours. I think that's what we're using currently. In it in it.

Host 3: What are Js x?

Client 1: I don't know what it stands for, but it's part of the java framework, and it is what we're using.

Client 1: Okay.

Host 3: Well, it's nice. It's one of the one of the options.

Client 1: Javascript, Xml. So it is java, but it's just the format of how you pass data.

Host 3: Okay.

Client 1: So, yeah, what I don't know is like, you can see here, it's kind of hard coating the width and the height. And so there's some things we can do when I look at the documentation, to just the to adjust the size i parameters Yeah.

Client 1: Oh, I didn't see on ours anything about powered by Meta base. I don't know if once it's published if that's gonna show up, but it does tell you how to get rid of that, and there's some rolls around when you're supposed to Oh, yeah. I think dashboard to fit content So there's different ways you can do it. But Anyway, yeah, that's that's what I figured out so far. For this. So I think what I'll do is actually, I think if you're an agreement, no border, no title, light mode, and allowing the store filter for now to so we can test.

Client 4: Totally I'll go ahead and hit publish on this again where's my published button.

Client 1: Oh, it's because it's already published. So i gonna say, I thought it I I'd already did that the other day. I was gonna be surprised if it made me redo don't how any changes So the question is is all still accurate and it should be Cool.

Client 4: Yeah. And theory right, Like, if I make any updates to the dashboard on my end, it'll just update.

Client 1: Yep.

Client 4: That's why there's like, only like, Me and you, and I think Harrison and and Jericho have permission to edit it at all just because we wanna avoid. Anyone breaking it on accident because then the customer will see whatever change.

Client 1: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I think what we'll have to do on this payload, We've got the resource, that's dashboard number fifty four parameters is where we can be like Okay. This is store Id equals thirty four or whatever that'll be a variable but we can pull based on the the store that select did and things like that. So I I... I'm I'm sure the developers can take it the rest of the way.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: That'll would be a huge upgrade from this. In fact, I've I'm been wondering about this, because when I was looking at Copper pearl last night and testing of the new roles. It only has one but when I look at their claims and everything. They've had tons of claims in the last a couple weeks, So I don't know why this current analytics is not working for copper pearl.

Client 4: Yeah don't even know, like, when that was built, honestly, like that don't know if it's even updating or like, where the information's being stored.

Client 1: Yeah. It's jan. So I'm I'm looking forward to wiping that with the meta bay stuff. And then you were saying, yes. The store should see the stores performance. So when I load this is admin, I see him... If this is all the store sorted by total orders. And you're seeing, like, total orders and touch orders and stuff. And so that's why Was wondering do we really want Oh, So in a store when A store tries to see this, it just loads...

Client 1: It was zero says I couldn't get the data. But I've either got fix that because it hasn't been working for a long time. Or like, I think Jericho was saying like, hey if we got a new dashboard coming, let's just not even show it.

Client 4: So what do we still need this?

Client 1: If we have your new dashboard I don't think...

Client 4: I mean, I don't know of anybody that uses that store's performance tab even internally.

Client 1: So... yeah, i I would either wanna move it down, like by us because it's an us thing or get rid of it altogether knowing that we can look at this anytime we want.

Client 4: Right. Let's we have internal dashboard two that has even more information.

Client 1: Yeah. Either we have our own internal one or is there a version of this that I can pass all stores, like, what happens if I So hold on. Let me go back to the actual You can't view two stores at once.

Client 4: On it. Like, the data is not is not correct that it pulls up. I don't know how meta meta decides which data to show you. But, like, right like, it's populating a random store live date, all those stores did not go live on July six Yeah.

Client 4: So we don't have, like, if you're looking for something that's more like all encompassing of source, we have like, our revenue a dashboard and also, like, if there are features that people are running for, like, a dashboard to look at. All of our stores we can definitely make that, but these are specific to being able to look at one sort at a time.

Client 1: So in this chain could we change this from a multi select Dan just to drop down with single select.

Client 4: I have tried to figure that out, and it doesn't look like meta database has that. Option. Like, when I'm when I'm adding filters.

Client 1: So what'll be nice is when we are here when we go to analytics, one of our users, whether it sells concierge or an admin, we can switch between stores and view this. The question is, do we want another, like another dashboard that is somewhere else that it shows acute... like, similar stats across all Now where am i in here. Similar of stats across all the stores. Or do we just tell people to go to meta base directly? Like, it wouldn't be hard have something embedded Right.

Client 1: Where it just shows, like, like, kind of cumulative stats So that's a question for you and probably Harrison Jericho. Topper, like, Do we wanna have something that's similar to the store's performance, but it's a view of certain things across all of our customers.

Client 4: Yeah. I think that's that's like a use case question. You know, like, that... If that's like, if people are in order protection dot com more than there in Meta base, and that's useful to them. And like, yeah, I agree with you. Like, that would not be very difficult, but if... Specifically, like, Topper, Jericho Harrison, you know, like, if you guys are in there. Let's put it in there for you if you're in Meta already, like, then we don't need to, but I'm always in Meta so I can't speak to that because I'm in Meta all day every everyday. But Yeah.

Host 3: Yeah. I'm in database quite a bit.

Client 1: Side on this with was sells and stuff, like, people are gonna be able to commit and few things. Right? Like, do you want them to be able to see something more holistic or are you quote with them just coming in here seeing individual stores as needed? And then going out to meta Yeah.

Host 3: I just think individual stores as needed is is great. Don't think they need anything holistic. Unless we wanted to do, like... I mean, like, even then in Meta bay, What I would recommend is having, like a store performance type view based on their like, filtered, based on, like, the owner Id. Like, in this spot one that poses the deal Then I can go and look at, like, every single deal that closed I can just monitor their performance holistically like that.

Client 4: But I don't think it needs to be in the portal.

Client 1: Yeah. So this goes way then is everyone on at least on this call, an agreement that This goes away We have a single analytics option here that loads the new meta based dashboard in line. Yeah. Yep.

Host 3: And was that Jericho feedback too I don't remember? And he...

Client 1: It was at least for the stores was like, They don't need it. It's going away. And so he was like, yeah. In the end, we're we're not gonna have two different things. We're just gonna have the new one. So based on his understanding of things last night, he was saying, both of these are going away for just one analytics. View Cool.

Host 3: Yeah. I love that. Yeah.

Client 1: Cool. So Cole, I think it would be great for us to mock up quick, then the new navigation we're under claims, we have new open approved denied. Those are all within this claims menu. All orders would be a its own stand a alone thing. And it would only be visible to order protection people. Analytics is just one item that's one top level thing that's just analytic. There's no expansion or other options. And at that point, I think I would favor just having billing and payouts be their own items without being collapsed.

Client 4: Oh, I agree with that so much. Because I actually am in there a lot using those two, and I'm I always Am like, why are these their own tabs? Because there are two separate things Yeah.

Client 1: Then we will have an expansion under admin settings that will have stores Not even store connection just stores, and I think that'll be the table we've been talking about cole. It'll have macro settings since those are global. It'll have on the store's page, the link to create a new store. And then we'll have a separate option here for users and it'll have this table. Does that make sense?

Client 2: Yep.

Client 1: So I'll send that in a slack just to have it straight, like, with that hierarchy, but I think that'll give us a see a place to go from. In fact, would we put all orders I guess when we leave at top level here, so we can see it or we put them underneath our admin settings like, how close does that need to be? I don't know how often we're even going into that. I do just to test things out every now and then, but Oh, but you know what? One of the reasons stores might use it is to be able to count order protection. Once you file the claim, you can't cancel it anymore. And so Maybe they need maybe they do need it. Know it can cause alarm, like, what you see all of our orders. Some of them don't care. But the only way to cancel order protection is to go to all orders and you can see what the ones that that have it and then you have this Oh boy. Cancel protection button that shows up.

Client 4: Yeah. I know historically, Jericho and Harrison have both, like, tried to keep us from drawing to attention that we have all the order data, but I don't have.

Client 1: I mean, it makes sense like, if there's ever question need to be able to see that they didn't purchase it or they did or if they had it and they didn't want it, like, we need to build to cancel it, you know, And so think there's a place for having it. It's just how much visibility it gets.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: So is that just been a concern that you've heard from Jericho Harrison? Or had you heard customers vocal mobilize it as well.

Client 4: I mean, I think specifically, maybe Topper can speak to it more, but I think that has come from route, definitely has, like, Ptsd from stuff. Like, with data security and that kind of stuff. Yep. One of the biggest issues we run into with people that don't wanna accept our permissions or people that came from route.

Client 1: Yeah.

Host 3: Yeah. Like, I just wanted at the they may search for an order as well.

Client 1: And like, if we don't show it, like, it wouldn't show up on of these screens, you know. So, like, where does that go?

Host 3: Yeah. And I just heard back from Yesterday, lost I mean, we closed them. But they don't wanna do the permissions thing. So they said gonna move another direction.

Client 4: Said.

Host 3: We could do. Too much about it.

Client 1: Dang it. Call one of the things that Harrison wants us to add to this table. Is the store name so that it's really obvious off the bat Like, especially when you're looking at all stores, The reality is that three four of these or or dazzle? We don't have a ton of real estate left. We do have some extra space. But I mean, claim status, if we're already on the new claims tab is, like, aldi these should have the same status of new. All these should be Well, some of them were communicating some of them we've dismissed. So there is a little bit a couple different options that are here approved. I guess you can see refund res shipped. So I guess there is some you there. I was just wondering maybe instead of protection status, maybe we have, like, order number with with the badge next to so you know how you have a new design it's like, the badge and it says protected protected one time. Maybe we just have a small badge that has that icon that's either this little lightning bolt protected. This one that's like a plus one for one time, And then there's the the not covered. Right?

Client 2: Yeah. I feel like this you that, but maybe we could do something just smaller where it's like a little bit more clear based on the order number or something else we then we have a whole new columns worth of space that we can say.

Client 1: Doodle dazzle giant James Or.

Client 2: Yeah. I feel like this will be one of many table problems and problems Harrison hit me up and said we're good to go ahead with the the grid. I mean, depending on the level of effort, like, you know, just tweaking the table and the columns and the spacing and and and all of that you know, like it'd be great to just kinda lock whatever we want for for all of these like, because I mean, having the the order number pinned to the left and having another call? I mean, I guess will depend on the level of effort get the new table up, but Yeah. I i I I think we could definitely, like, find space for it, but is also just on your screen. Right? Actually, what happens right now if you start shrinking your screen, I haven't gone into the responsiveness and keep going. Just stacks Yeah. So I mean, this is the other option too. Right? And everyone gonna get a slightly different view of this, but we just allow it to keep stacking for now. Until we get The table?

Client 1: Yeah. And we could decide, like, you start shrinking it, then we drop the claims column or we dropped the you know, like, we can start dropping columns. We can be a little bit less for verbose on the date or something This is this is where pinning is is nice.

Client 2: Because... Yeah. Because I mean, ideally, would just have avocado on the left. Right? Then you could still have all the columns you want but you could, like, scroll back forth between them, and so you don't have to worry about, like, oh, this column doesn't like, exactly fit for for this screen size or we wanna add three more columns or or whatever the case is. It just eliminates a lot of that. The Ui questions. They'll come up from that. I mean, the other thing is too once we have all of our cells. Right? Like, like, like to think, like this... Like, you should also be able to view this in, like, a card view. Very easily. Right? Like, they're... Like, if once we have all of our cells, it's just a representation of data. Just like the the code. Right? And we should be able to put it into a card view for for mobile, for example. Exactly. Except not have it all custom code or just just like we wanna display this data in this way.

Client 1: Yeah. We have we we had a couple things where like, when you shrunk it down to mobile instead of saying it would a claim date, but this was switching to the order date. And it was... So things were out of sync like, because we had a whole different mobile in issues. So we just fixed a few bugs so that it's consistent whether it's regular view or mobile view Yeah.

Client 2: It's kinda funny.

Client 1: But for now, I'll just put in the store. So I don't know you guys have any preference on where what order it is, you know, where would store name go? In this order. Order date store customer, I don't really have a preference.

Host 3: Yeah. I'd put the store but but I put the store call before the customer. And that's the only column that we're adding there Brian.

Client 1: Yeah. For now, that's the next one.

Host 3: Can we put the resolution type?

Client 1: You're talking about, like, we have here.

Host 3: Oh, sorry. I already see it. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

Client 1: Yeah. Well... Yeah. We're right now with finish issue.

Host 3: Claim.

Host 3: Oh, I'm looking at... Go to new claims. Yes. So claim status is new. But if you click into one of those claims, then you see that it's res, and you see the resolution type.

Host 3: Yeah. So sorry, I was referring for new claims if we that's what they're requesting right they wanna res ship.

Host 3: Yeah. So you can just see high level here. I don't know if that's super helpful, but Yeah. I the only understand and I so they just jump right on and get it to the next step Yeah.

Host 3: May it's already within view of of the approval button. Yeah.

Client 1: K. The way, what was one of the new stores that we just onboard? Bundled baby.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: I was noticing that we don't have a quick link to their order number. For some reason. I look at their orders, they all have a like a different numbering ski, like, order number pattern that I'm used to for other stores.

Client 1: But there's some reason why it's... We're not getting here I need to have him look at it But it's only... I'm not seeing that for all stores. I I just happen to notice it for the new one, Interesting.

Client 1: Are some of our other new ones? Who was right before bundled baby?

Client 4: there's, like, Hey, guys.

Host 3: I gotta jump another another call.

Client 4: Over newly onboard ones. I feel like a re by see working.

Client 4: Eager via Flo rocking rags copper pearl X x by.

Client 1: Yeah. All those are working fine. It's just something about that store maybe you must be looking for a certain pattern and and it doesn't match. So I'll I'll have to Oh, man, it be nice to have somebody to go through every store and just pick an order and see if you can if you see the link or not, like, here's arm. I'll go to pick any random order Do I see the link right here If so, great. If not, what's going on. So bundle baby go look at order It's not there. So like, happening with other stores too.

Client 4: I'm sure that we would have already heard about it. From the claims team.

Client 1: Yeah. I mean, we just barely added that a few weeks ago. So I don't know how often used adequate seem to do it, and they can still get to it from down here. So it would be nice to have somebody just go through one at a time and check and see like, literally you select the store go to all orders, pick any order and see if it shows up. It'd be nice to know if any other runs are missed. Oh, you know what? Cold my Let's get hack real quick.

Client 1: Let's go look at the stores in the database. I think I know what it is. Bundled baby, platform Id is is blank. So if I go and put a one in here, to say that that shopify I'm gonna refresh the page. Let's see if that is enough to get it. Hold. Oh I get the wrong button. That's what I meant to click on There we go. You order and shopify.

Client 4: Your wizard?

Client 1: So... See I have a ticket for c to do that. So up until recently, every every store was spot or with Shopify. Right? Everything we get in our code just assumed it. So now that we have other platforms, now we've gotta to say, oh, well, do they do this if it shopify do something different if it's Mag magenta and so on. So when we onboard new stores, we need to make sure we're selecting which... platform they're on if it's Shopify it's one, In fact, do you know on these other ones, I can go and manually update these which ones All those ones should have a value So what's this one? Dev dash order p. That must be a test one.

Client 4: Yeah eighty six subscription testing, simply dot com simply computing their Shopify.

Client 4: But he hasn't done onboarding for them yet, but but... Yeah. And same with computer clearance.

Client 1: Bank jewelry survival gear. All of those are Shopify. Right?

Client 4: Correct.

Client 1: Okay. I don't like that it's So it's the last four we should just add that to the onboard ticket Yeah.

Client 1: We need to have it just be automatic. So when you select the one platform, it can do this. Subscription testing on production, that's Shopify and this dev one is gonna be shopify probably So I'm just gonna populate that value for everyone. And now everyone should work. Cool Cool. Hey do you guys do do you ever use this?

Client 4: No.

Client 1: Is Topper so he problem?

Client 4: Think... Dropped.

Client 1: I I fed out the other day that this doesn't do anything. Remove either does disconnect me does this drop down.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: You might do something, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

Client 4: I'm pretty sure they don't do anything because when Jericho was first showing me around even I started in October, he was like, Yeah. We need to remove all of these cards because they don't actually do anything and they're just in everybody's way.

Client 1: Yeah at a minimum call and I have talked about having a stores page where it just has a table and you can see, like, this is copper pearl you know, here's blah blah blah. But for the most part, like, if you wanted to sure to be active or not? You would select the store and then go to settings, and then you would like have a toggle here. Right? You'd wanna do everything from their settings page Right.

Client 1: You wouldn't wanna come here, find them and do something. So if if these like, these do have some logic. Whether or not it actually works, I don't know, if it does, we should move it over to here and then get rid of all these cards.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: Sometimes I'll shrink this window just slightly. Now. It doesn't scroll horizontally.

Client 1: That here in manage user. But look how many users are pending and it's because they don't get the email because goes to their spam folder So we need a way to say, like, hey, this is gonna look like this, you know, you're gonna have Where's my trash. Gonna have something like this invitation from, and then you're gonna... It's gonna come from support. It end order protection dot com. If people search for that, they can usually find it in their junk box.

Client 4: Yeah. We should just add that to Sarah's onboarding email that she sends out when she sends them their credentials.

Client 1: Yep. And and if they ever have a problem, I feel like we should be able to come in here. I know that we can res. So let's say like, you know, Topper doesn't get this thing. We can come in here and we can always send the verification email. I wonder if there's like, a format that we can, like copy the verification link and just send it to them.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: Because like waiting for people to go do that, like look how many are waiting here. What's funny is a lot of these are people who are managing. Right, clean right.

Client 1: So how are they doing their job right now that they've never logged in? Are they just logging in as admin or somebody else Say better not have the admin log in.

Client 1: So a lot of people do by the way. It's it's kind of gotten out more and more and more as people have needed it to do their jobs. So that's why I've spent a lot of time in the last month fixing permissions.

Client 1: And so we now have the ability when we create users. Some of these are not valid, but we have concierge administrator and sales. Before even as an administrator, you couldn't do things and now you can. So at this point, like, it was literally just a couple weeks ago. I had Sara and Topper get their own account so that they could do things as themselves and not have to be admin. We've got developers with the admin account. I think we've got some claims people to have it And so for, like, logging purposes, like, we wouldn't be able track down who did what. And so I'd like to do once we get these last couple bugs fixed, I would like to change the password on the admin account and not give it to anybody? And different who needs it, but like, at this point, shouldn't be any different than just being administrator, and we can include many of those need and now we can do some auditing if we need.

Client 4: Yes. Yeah. I mean, for now, yeah. I mean, I'm I was more saying like, I would hope that claims reps are not using the admin still. When it's like, Topper or Sarah, like... Yeah. I know that they just barely got their own accounts and, like, sometimes it was buggy in the beginning. So whatever, but like, the claims especially. Like, we need to be able to collect, like, workforce management data on them. So Yes I... It's that's... If those are their emails, that's definitely a concern Yeah.

Client 1: This this means that they haven't logged in yet. Then they they emails passwords.

Client 4: Solution. That's all of them.

Client 1: What's in?

Client 4: That collective solution dot net. Those are That's, like their email you a claim Okay.

Client 1: So we've got one two three, four, five, six, seven of them that have never logged in as themselves.

Client 4: Well that's good to know. I'm going just sarah.

Client 1: Now actually, this is interesting. Maybe she has two accounts, so, like men you can see this one's never logged in. This one has as of two days ago. So I guess if I go back, she has two accounts, dot, and that's the same one. So I think I should be able to delete this extra one.

Client 1: As logged in with that one So maybe it's not as bad as I thought. Maybe data's just got added a couple times ronald Okay. So Ronald has never logged in. Yep. Devin when has one never logged in. El. That's interesting here is divine and d demeanor So we should see which of those is correct.

Client 1: And we can delete the other one. Right?

Client 4: Does Sarah have permissions to do something like that like Delete accounts aren't being used.

Client 1: Oh, yeah when you clear it off the one page, it delete to that about zero as well.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 1: Now is that the Csi, order protection general, they they'd be in there. Right?

Client 4: Yes.

Client 1: So this is divine with an e I can't view the full profile. But either way, it looks like it's with an e So I would think we get rid of this one. Right? I don't know though, I'd like to see maybe she just says it that way. I I don't know if we have a way to see her email address.

Client 2: Then jump off guys.

Client 1: Okay. Hey. Thanks Paul for here.

Client 1: We can this through that working stuff. We'll talk to you later.

Client 2: No I was working on the background. I just... I was like, oh, I should probably leave. Thanks, guys.

Client 1: Thank you.

Client 4: Yeah. I don't know how to see their email.

Client 1: Me the Kay stuff. I'm not worried about. Who's No idea.

Client 4: He's active right now Yeah.

Client 4: Don't know who that is.

Client 1: So those are all the ones that haven't logged in. Only one of them had a duplicate rest haven't logged in at all. So we could we can always help them make and we can trigger a new thing and then say, hey, go search for this in your spam Yeah.

Client 1: Who I I'm logging as James Porter. I'm gonna log in as myself.

Client 4: I know. I'm like always in the admin minute account, but Yeah.

Client 1: Me too.

Client 4: I know I do have my own Well, maybe you don't.

Client 1: We should see I just logged in.

Client 4: I'm like, okay You. But I I don't have the admin settings tab on online.

Client 1: Yeah. So you're in here as Concierge. So should be administrator.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: Okay. You might need to do this. Right click on your screen, in if in the portal and say inspect, okay.

Client 1: And then do you see little double tab here where you can see more Yes go to application, Okay and click on storage.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 1: Then click on clear site data.

Client 4: Got it.

Client 1: Then come over here and the little lock next to admin at order protection dot com. Select cookies?

Client 4: K.

Client 1: Just hit remove a bunch of times until all these are gone.

Client 4: K?

Client 1: And now click on this refresh button and choose empty cash and hard reload. It's gonna force you to log in again Yeah.

Client 1: And let's see if when you go back in if you got all the tabs.

Client 4: Yes. I do.

Client 1: You shouldn't have to do all those things. But the way we do it right now, stuff gets cash, and we don't clear it out. So that's the sure surefire way to get it worked through. Cool.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 1: So yeah, you're now upgraded to administrator should be good to go. So now that I'm here, I'm gonna probably go to each of these people and I'm gonna... And I'm gonna send a message or like, tell off zero to send them like their their login again, like their invitation And now when this thing comes, I know it's gonna say invitation from Brian from.

Client 1: They can either search by that or they can search from support at send dot order protection dot com.

Client 4: Cool.

Client 1: But, yeah, it's a fascinating thing. If you go to the user management for stores. They're in pretty good shape, but if you get to some of these brands, Blender bottle, you've got one, two, three people who have never been able to log in you're gonna see this all over the place.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: And it's it's unfortunate that our stuff gets arrested like that. Like, it'd be so nice if we could manually get a link to help them set their password.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: If not. We could... like, this would be... I don't know who it it would be a good person to do this, but we can literally assign somebody select the first store. Go look at their users. Okay, They're all set up. That's great. Now let's go to Angel Brink. Okay. They're not even set up. So what we should do is we should actually we log in using the owner's credentials. They may actually have users, but since the owners never logged in, it doesn't have a place to will be everybody else and so it shows blank.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: Apparel by Ivan, okay, two pending invitation, and in fact, I'm like, oh, wow look, you got Jericho and Nigel. In tests. So obviously Yeah.

Client 1: You did a lot of testing and then didn't clean it up.

Client 4: By is It is kind of a test or it's, like, someone that Jericho does business with personally he like, handles this guy's finance. He's like a rapper, but Jericho net, like, five years ago or something. And Jericho Might handles this finances for him and so he uses his merch store as a test for order protection.

Client 1: Okay.

Client 4: Because I think Jericho kind of, like manages his whole business.

Client 1: Okay. So, yeah, roman three sixty, like, you would literally coming here and saying recent invitation, recent invitation, and then you could send an email here just from your own account or whoever's was doing this thing like, hey. It looks like... Yeah. You haven't logged into your order protection account yet.

Client 1: Log in check your spam. You you should either have any another email that says this or if not, here's how to find it. And then we can just help people get in, like, I feel like on these, we either wanna help them get in or we wanna remove them they can't get in any way, and maybe they don't need it anymore. So, like, I don't know. It almost feels like there's, like, an opportunity for maybe our salespeople people like, if this is my account, I say like, hey. Megan. I'm just looking through here, a couple of people sat logged in. Can we just review the list of users sure everyone who read access has if they don't need it, we can clean it up. I don't know. That also gives a chance how are things going. What can we do to support you? Hey. We have a new button that we have available. So if you wanna opt have it be opt out by default, to we can to put the new theme in place, and that'll make it so that if customers didn't want, they can cancel on their own. Like, I'd... Maybe we put together a list like that of what we wanna do to like, give a good touch point to help everybody get updated I totally agree when you were saying I don't know who this would be...

Client 4: I was like, I was like, I think this would be best, like a Cs role. You know, like, this is is customer service we're gone in and we're paying attention to the details and showing them that we care that like, they haven't logged in. What can we do to help you we're being proactive rather than finding them emailing us being like, we can't get in, you know?

Client 1: Yeah. And in fact right now, the new roles that I put in place it looks to me like cells does not have user management. So we might wanna consider that part of the sales role is, like, if if they're the person that gets contacted, Yeah.

Client 1: For these things, either we've gotta to have an administrator do it like me use sarah Topper or whomever.

Client 4: I think it's era who would be contacted Sarah.

Client 4: Yeah. Because they... I mean, as soon as it closes, they're literally told by the Ae. They're like, okay, there is a point of contact from here on out?

Client 1: Okay. And sarah's an administrator, so she's okay. Yeah. Yeah. That was the question is what we want sells people to be able to see that. Are they having those conversations? If not, then it would just be sarah.

Client 4: Yeah. I think that there's little to know follow up after accounts have closed. With Aes right now. I know that Topper wants to change that. And have them be more involved of like, hey, just because you got across Finish line doesn't mean like, you wanna be taking care of these people, this is where your commission comes from. But I like, right now, it it is all sarah. So Okay.

Client 1: I'm gonna show you my little demo here you're ready.

Client 4: Mh.

Client 1: Here's a wall. They they had a report that they have a bunch of All these are orders they had order protection twice.

Client 4: Yeah. I was just looking at that.

Client 1: I don't know if you saw my my message, but I I know how to make it happen can add an add to cart you can see that our stuff does what you'd expect. It's there. It's turned on Yeah.

Client 1: Go check out, it's exactly what you expect where you've got the items, you can't change it. But if you go back to this cart, and do the full one. As soon as you start toggling a change in quantity, order protection shows up and you can likewise toggle the quantity.

Client 4: and they can just... They might think they need more than one.

Client 1: Yeah. They're like, oh, I have two bottles. I need two order protections. You know. I can I can get it way out of whack here. And now if I continue, you know, I've got two bottles in eight order protection. So we need to find a way to either force, like, to make sure that order protection doesn't appear, when you're changing companies, Or like, oh, look at that. It says one And if I check out it's back to one. And so it's changing. Like, we need we need to be able to enforce only quantity one Yeah.

Client 1: I don't know if in Shopify if there's a way, like, when you have products, you know, sometimes, like, stores will limit you to, like, two of this item or one. Like, I wonder if we can... If there's something we can do when they add us to their to their inventory. To where they only allow it once on an order That's a good idea actually.

Client 4: That might be the easiest way to do it. I would imagine... I mean, we're, like, we are an item in inventory. So like, I would imagine you can just set an inventory pretty easily.

Client 1: Yeah. Products. Right? Like, I'm just curious if we look would a protection.

Client 1: Yeah, I don't wanna have to make them purchase another app about to say looking at the same thing, Looks like an or is it, but Yeah.

Client 1: There's some things that you're like, I get that there's other apps and and add ons. That's cool and all, but there's some things that your base product just needs to be able to do.

Client 4: Yep. I'm looking one of them that's just, like set a Max attribute on Html input elements. Or try to limit product using javascript. No. This is not recommended as customers can find an easy workaround for that. Let it using card add variant Id perm link. The best approach would be to use script editor because customers can't find a way to bypass that limitation. So Yeah. I mean, it doesn't look like it actually it Of course, I'm like, That seems like it should be something really easy in shopify.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 4: Wrong Yeah.

Client 1: Everyone's just saying like, yeah, we've got order limit and order logic. Yep. Mean, five bucks a month, I mean, freak, if we're if we're collecting all this money and then having to refund it and it causes trust issues with us or with customers like, Right.

Client 1: Not there's nothing, you know. It's just too bad that you can't just do that natively. Like, but there's gotta be a way we can script that as well whereas things are going through. We just like, do some logic checks Yeah.

Client 1: Like, now that we know how it can happen, it would be good to see if Okay. We know at least one way it's manifesting itself is...

Client 4: Right.

Client 1: You edit quantity, and then we're un hiding Well...

Client 4: And that's what I was trying to find in meta, like, how to even identify like, duplicates of, like, how we store the data. I was like, do we store it? I was like, the same order Id, but two different order in insurance Ids I was, like, in the middle of writing and I haven't.

Client 1: Look at this. This is really fascinating to me. I've got two of each I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna change it to three water bottles. We got two order protection. Before It was changing it to one automatically when I went to three let's went to two there and this is now three.

Client 1: So now washington gonna go back? I'm gonna go to three I'm down one, What?

Client 1: So it's it's changing. Like, literally each time I go in, So that was three and one, I'm gonna go to two. One I don't know. It's it's it's weird, but least we can see how it's possible and we can at least try to troubleshoot it from there.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean, that's really the only way that I can think of that a customer would achieve that. Twice because there's no way for them to, like, I mean, I guess unless there was a glitch, you know, they toggle it on off on off and it goes in there twice, but we've never seen that before and that clearly isn't happening. So Did you see that It looks like bank jewelry is ready for us to preview.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 4: So as soon as you see that and approve that also send fit to Sarah and Topper, and then we can go forward.

Client 1: Oh, so yeah let's talk through that real quick. So let me go back to onboarding here. So is this the one he let us know? This one's good to go?

Client 4: Yes.

Client 1: Oh, yeah. So they said this store doesn't use sidecar car, so I added it to the widget cart page.

Client 1: Yeah. So if when you see this, Who is it that normally turns it on? Is that usually you?

Client 1: Like, do you normally send these screenshots and things to the customer to vet? Or do you just turn it on and say, hey, we're live It's kind of on a case by case basis.

Client 4: Some customers are, like, I want to be the one to turn it on. So I show them. Okay, You're gonna need to go and publish this theme. They're like, okay. Cool. Or I just... like, I tell him... Okay. We're ready. Our am I good to push slide like we've tested. It's all working, and they'll be like, yep. So it just depends Okay.

Client 4: So like to have the control and some people don't there So for me, there's nothing I need to see or no, like, for it to go live.

Client 1: So if if you're able to get the details to him. He's able to do the work. Like, from here, you can download these send to the customer or whatever and say oh, here's the mobile view. Here's an example desktop view. Just so you know, in your situation, you don't use a so we just put it on the main cart page. Like, as soon as they say, go, either walk them through it or you can turn it on for them, and then you can just change this from in progress done. So there's nothing I feel like I need to do.

Client 4: Okay.

Client 1: It'd be great if just you're able to put it in, and then he can do it and then you just go from there and unless you need me to help with something.

Client 4: Yeah. Totally. I'm sorry. It like cut out there at the end. But Yeah. I... like, Normally, I just like more than one person to look at it. But that can also be like, my process can just be I see that link from him. I'm always communicating to Aaron Topper before I go live anyway, so I'll just be like, hey. Click this link make sure it works for you too. So then at least we've tried it on, like, four people, you know.

Client 1: Yeah.

Client 1: Cool. Yep. And then we're good. So on these other ones, there was one of these that he said Survival gear. Yeah. So he basically said, There's a technical blocker here. And he put a video about how they don't use something normal so we put it somewhere out. So I have Ten look at this at lunch today.

Client 1: Okay. Then I just said, like, all looks great. Let's go ahead and move it forward. So normally, I wouldn't worry about doing that because I was with Topper and Sarah. We look at it together and I let him know.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 1: Okay. Yeah.

Client 4: Cool.

Client 1: In this, by the way, I see this assigned platform to store during onboarding.

Client 4: Oh, that's it.

Client 1: That's what we what look at earlier where it was showing up because we hadn't assigned it it was shopify.

Client 4: Gotcha.

Client 1: So we should have update the code to retrieve the Id from the platform table, and then you use that here. And so Anyway, we just manually we updated it for what was out there. But I've asked them to work on that.

Client 4: Cool Cool Well, I think we're good for the day, but that was a lot of stuff that was awesome.

Client 1: For joining that meeting ad hoc and working through it with us.

Client 4: Totally, I'm excited to see that analytics tab up... Because, yeah, I know that one currently on there all are just like what if it is this? So k. Awesome. Then office push banks lives as soon as I get it thumbs up from them, so Sweet Awesome.

Client 4: Thank you.

Client 1: Bye. Right.
