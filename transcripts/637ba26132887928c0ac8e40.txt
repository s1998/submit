Client 3: Oh, dear good. Ten thirty Hello nice meet you.

Host 1: Yeah. What what time is it? Where you owe So.

Client 3: It's four thirty in the afternoon.

Host 1: Okay. That's good. So that's. Well, thanks a ton taking the time really appreciate. So the for this conversation is that will the team of the at tim floor and we're working on a sales tool. So what we're building a few applications for salespeople and the one that we're looking into is divers. And so this is basically us looking to learn about the market and and, you know, what people like but it des slightly control and too forth. So just very open ended indeed kind of conversation. Yeah. I I believe I found your name on g two. I think you were talking about vehicle. So yeah. Just generally to feel about your experience with the apple. Perhaps we can kick it up please... Can you tell us little bit about you. And what what do you do? What does your do?

Client 3: I myself you may have seen I work for insightful. It's a productivity and workforce analytics platform. We provide our clients with insights and visibility how employees spend their workday hours, whatever active or not, what is Dm amount of productivity? Where the bottlenecks in productivity and how sample can help webs improving on those. I'm a myself work as an enterprise account executive.

Host 1: Got it. What kind of employee? Gonna Very very good question.

Client 3: We're talking about any type of activity that can happen on employees computers. Nowadays when many are working remotely or in hybrid very often and employer doesn't have in enough sign to which program simple use, whether they use them in the right way whether are they're spending too much time away from a computer and what is it that may be pulling employees away from a computer? That is exactly where insightful can assist And it's a very user friendly the solution that doesn't even require spending too much time into two analyzing that data. A lot of data is already... Let's say digested ready to use and to pretty much we tend to deliver a lot of different kinds of actionable insights.

Host 1: Got it. And how big is the company and how is your team there?

Client 3: Our company counts around eighty employees. The majority of employees are here and some of the employees are in the United States.

Host 1: Got it. And how how how big is is your team of of Sales?

Client 3: Eighteen or nineteen employees right now? Ranging from lead gen team all the way up to team leadership.

Host 1: That makes sense. And so do you do you get your leaves? Like, do you do you generate your own or order does someone give you leads?

Client 3: Well, marketing, I have to say is doing a tremendously good job. So we do rely on marketing a lot. We have some incredible professionals that are very good that direct job. They do deal with different kind of campaigns and depending on the region or what weave from the sales are recognizing as a potential we're suggesting the markets or industries that could be beneficial. But in that sense, we are getting a lot of leads from the inbound communication depending on what what are the companies that may have visited our website or left any of the information on the website's websites but we also have an outbound sales team that does a very good job to it. Ideal customer profile companies.

Host 1: That makes sense. And how did you find out about gold in the fields please.

Client 3: Well, we have to look for a solution that's gonna help us let's say autumn itemized a lot of things and automate how we're gonna be connecting different programs that we're working with where we can see different data from one program to another and that is where pretty much, it was very easy to let's say focus on air call because first of all, it's very very nicely integrated with older the solutions that we use internally. A lot of things are automated. So there is not too much work to do in order to make it work. It's very convenient to use it on the go if you have to let's say get away from the computer, but still be available So that actually helped us shortlist list the solution very very easily. And we have been using it for more than two years now.

Host 1: And do you remember what other solutions you looked into?

Client 3: We have been and not remember every everyone of those we were as we're using cups but there's the internal Crm. We have contacted them first for an build solution right there, but because we're we're using different program simply wasn't good enough to cover all our needs. I think we were also looking into talk desk ring central. I'm not sure whether there was anything else. But right now, for example, besides the air call, because we also rely on sales we're using their integrated dial as well.

Host 1: Sounds left.

Client 3: Yes.

Host 1: Yes. So you use both sales and and and eth.

Client 3: That is correct. Part of the team relies on the sales side. Sales loft, Not the whole sales team relies on it. But those who do, they switched from air called to to sales.

Host 1: Why?

Client 3: Because of the how sales is organized. Because what they offer in their plan, it was more reasonable for us to go with the sales loft integrated solution.

Host 1: Cindy. What go ahead.

Client 3: As simply the flow because the the outbound Sdr, they have to go through a lot of calls, a lot of companies and leads and simply, the flow is a little bit easier in the sense that if you're gonna spare five or ten per call maybe even more from switching from one tab to another you're gonna save a lot more throughout a day not to talk about a month or a quarter. So in that sense, it's way more reasonable to rely on it. But the majority of the team still relies on air exclusively.

Host 1: No. That makes sense. You mentioned that mentioned a hotspot hubspot wasn't good enough what what was wrong with it?

Client 3: It wasn't that anything was wrong.

Client 3: But because we are using different solutions throughout our platforms. And how fast it is and reliable we decided to go with air call. Because some of the we have discovered some of the limitations and bugs I cannot tell you exactly what was so so annoying about it, but the error call seemed a more reasonable solution And now because of being perfectly integrated with Gong that we used with the hops spot that I mentioned. That that flow is simply very, very difficult to to say no to. Let's say.

Host 1: I got it. So was it was it the like hubspot wasn't as well integrated and and was Buggy. Was that is is that a pun?

Client 3: Yeah that's correct. That is correct.

Host 1: What what what what what kind of integrations do you need?

Client 3: Well, right now, we are heavily relying on the inner ration with with Gong We are relying on... I know that marketing maybe be used using it occasionally Let me double check then yes, the necessity to be available on the smartphone as well, way more convenient to use it to then one fantastic advantage of of air call is that when you're using with your smart devices, you are also notified. Depending on how you use different solutions. For example, if you're using a smart watch or something you are gonna be having your smart for the watch ring as well with the air call application installed on smartphone. So in that sense, we're talking about a lot of those little things that are making availability much much easier with air call present.

Host 1: That makes sense. What what all your favorite things about eth?

Client 3: For me favorite things are the fact that it rings on my smartphone as well. Very easy to set it up when we talk about the availability very easy to go to the recordings. Very nice interface when looking and going through those recordings, they're easy to to by... Or let's say walk through your call if you need to listen to it very easy to filter throughout the application. The setup process is very easy And that a fantastic thing is that the add on for Chrome will recognize phone phone numbers in a lot of different websites So it's very easy to pull up a dial As soon as you click on the number, very, very convenient and and sometimes saving. You can even do that and it's gonna recognize phone numbers within hop spot and make it easier to make a vocal call. So you sometimes and very often actually, you don't even have to go through the suggested workflow then hubspot has which is make a call and then you choose a number But on multiple parts of the screen, you're gonna see a phone number of the prospect you're looking to call and you're gonna pull up a dial. In that sense how how intuitively reacts to user commands, it's very users flow. Is very very convenient. If you need to make a call from the phone, also convenient as well. You have a very nice looking dial you don't have to run around spot, if you do have numbers, you can just simply dive and dial them from from the smartphone too. One thing for example, that I don't like, is that you need to Let's say It's not as intuitive if you want to look for a phone number that you dialed from within the program. Of course, the Pentagon the team you're not gonna run through air call at all in order to look for phone numbers, but sometimes you may to dan the most intuitive, but that is just need the haystack if if I specifically have to find something that I don't like. Their support is fantastic. It will stay on top of it order to to resolve any of the challenges you may have encountered and make sure that but they assist you as soon as possible.

Host 4: Was Air code, the only product that you looked at that had a mobile app That one...

Client 3: That one was the one that we looked into the most. Because also due to the team size back then two and so years ago, we didn't even have too much bandwidth in order to thoroughly analyze multiple solutions. Or test it out.

Host 4: Got it. Okay. You.

Host 1: You you mentioned support. How often and the you reached called support.

Client 3: Luckily, not too often, I would say maybe once a quarter, even when I think about team team challenges, I would say approximately once a quarter, it may be sarah, you know to try to to understand whether the challenge was due to connect activity issues of some of the team members or it was an air call issue let's say once once a quarter.

Host 2: That that chrome extension that you mentioned, how often are you using that? What did you use it for?

Client 3: What's great is that with the Chrome extension, all you need to do is to log in and it's gonna help with identifying phone numbers the page. So you don't have to interact with it too often. What happens occasionally, which is a little bit annoying, but not one annoying is that it logs you out. It's it may be security or of a or privacy let's say action, but you do have to reel login into and it's gonna It's simply gonna help you with the flow. So for example, if you don't have it active, you will have to go through the for example, Hubspot suggested flow call and then choose a number. But if you do have the add on, and it's recognizing the phone numbers you can immediately call the dial or from by clicking the the number itself. So very, very convenient in that sense. Very good. And I do have to say how in mind that I that I did change companies So far, air is the best solution that I have that I have used so far. Now if you... If you ask me right away, which solutions we have been using, We have been using z dial before We have been using the integrated hubspot, not in this company, but in some of the previous companies I've been what and so far the most the most intuitive end user friendly air all seems to be the one.

Host 1: You mentioned recording, does automatically recall all your meetings.

Client 3: It does. It does. All the... Basically all the phone calls. Yes. Automatically recorded, you can look for those recordings throughout the program itself because of our integration with Gong within Gong itself, we can listen to the recordings too. So very, very convenient in that sense as well.

Host 1: And how does it wear like? Does it does it wool as the person that you're talking that the call is being recorded?

Client 3: It doesn't. No.

Host 1: Interesting.

Client 3: On the other hand, for example, when we're having the live meetings or let's say, Google meet or something, then we're using Gong that does notify that the meeting is recorded.

Host 1: What do you use the recordings for?

Client 3: Are we talking about phone recording phone call recordings or the meeting recordings.

Host 1: Either.

Client 3: Well, we do use them When we talk about the meeting recordings, we use them for sharing them with clients in order for them to have access to everything we have discussed because very often in now demos we talk extensively about multiple features of our own solution. And sometimes they do return it if it is you know, a feature walk through specifically, they will return to it in order to music as as a source of knowledge. The other way we use all those recordings is Very easy for note taking. During a meeting, you don't have to lose focus from a conversation, but you can take the dig the notes later The gong, for example, is so fantastic that it's gonna do transcription of older the conversations it can do the search. By a keyword word. So it's very very good solution for training and improvement opportunity for each individual person dance has their meetings recorded. Same thing goes for for air call. We have inbound and outbound Sdr that their main job is to focus on booking meetings. And sometimes, they may miss here a certain information and they ask for help. So listening to the recording will be very, very meaningful rather than bothering someone to repeat a certain email or a phone number or anything that may sound maybe muffled, you know, instead of asking them to repeat five tons, you will just say, hey, okay, and then someone's gonna ask queue or someone else, Hey, can you please listen to the recording? I'm not sure what the email addresses.

Client 3: That still doesn't happen too often, but it is very important then again, of course, for for those purposes of verifying data. And another a great thing, where we use the the phone call rate recordings is to make sure that both inbound and outbound Sdr are doing exactly what they're supposed be in the sense of using specific keywords depending on the type of testing that they're conducting in a sense of a campaign. Specific keywords or specific topics that are going to push our prospects in to booking a meeting, or in order to make sure that Simply they're doing their job well. So predominantly leads it's the training purposes in those video recordings for sharing them with clients and training purposes as well.

Host 1: What's the difference between ed recordings and gong recordings?

Client 3: Well, we do we do use air call for for phone call recordings only. One other segment that I haven't mentioned so far, I'm not even sure why is that with the Us market, air call is a very good solution when it comes to text messaging. Very convenient. Text messaging is a great add on for an additional nudge towards prospects who may be unresponsive. So very, very good feature there as well. And we when we talk about the Gong, it's gonna help you you know, For instance, I'm not even sure I i don't I don't assume that air call can record a Google meet calls or anything similar, but the gong is way more calm blacks in the sense of providing suggestions different types of Ai that can help you with suggesting follow ups calls, it's gonna pull out notes where exactly you mentioned you will follow up on a specific top making is gonna remind you about that. So in that sense, fantastic solution. And also, it does store data for a very long time. So if you need to go over certain recordings from a year or two years ago, you can easily pull those back up. In order order to talk about improvement in quality quality assurance training purposes for for new team members. So a lot a lot of opportunities where Gong seems to be a very, very helpful full solution. And frankly speaking, we even thought about Ditching gong not long ago due to pricing But we realized that it's not that easy to let Gong go.

Host 1: Why not?

Client 3: Because simply we we revisited the idea and revise that in a sense of what we're gonna lose if we stop using if we stop using Gong and simply simply the the negatives were so much bigger than the positive in case we canceled it, so we decided to stick with it no matter how how expensive it is.

Host 1: What would you lose if you can consult to gong?

Client 3: The opportunity to track quality of the meetings of the we've been very very thorough a Qa approach towards towards each account executive. And in that sense, a lot of calls are no matter how long is someone with the company, we will continuously look for our opportunities to improve our phone calls. No matter how how many quarters you reach or target not just individually, but the team wise we're continuously looking for ways to to improve quality of those calls and trans other the conversation and the notes and how easy it is to follow and and analyze keywords is fantastic. Another great thing about the gong specifically is that it's gonna score the conversation between two people it was one side or not, interactivity what they call it, It's gonna show exactly the suggested range of a ratio, how much he's be compared to the customer. It's gonna tell you how long the customer stories where the areas of of improvement targets. It's gonna suggest the timeline when to chase them and not to let them cool off so very, very good solution I have the same.

Host 1: Yeah. Do you have a sense of how much you're spending for com?

Client 3: I don't, but if you want, I can check that for you. I think I should be able to get better of information.

Host 1: I would love that if you were able to follow up and I'm be curious. Because that's okay but sure.

Client 3: No worries.

Host 1: Thank you. Tell more... I I realized i be were asked do you use air? What do you use it for?

Client 3: For example, account executives, will use Gong to follow up with clients to answer the calls because we don't have teams other than sales being risk sponsored on those inbound calls So it's for outbound reach out towards prospects you're are all already speaking with. To connect with them if necessary, to receive inbound calls to As I mentioned until recently outbound team was using air called for reaching out to the outbound potential clients. Now they switched to sales. And inbound Sdr, they still need to reach out to those who have left their data on our website for the for the purpose of booking demo and introduction call. And as I mentioned yet, that is approximately seventeen eighteen team members and out of those seventeen eighteen, let me tell you how many use air call I would say that is around ten to twelve people. And he air called pretty much The majority of those ten twelve every day, And do you have a sense of how much you pay full echo?

Client 3: I don't know exactly. Because we may have that recently that is something that our sales manager took up on him. But I can check that as well. For air call and the Gong. Having in my debt. I've been with a company for quite some time that should be in easy information to get.

Host 1: Great. So separately from air and Gong and all that's that. Like, generally speaking, what all your top problems right now, work?

Client 3: Problems. If you ask me specifically, I would say there are no problems.

Host 1: Oh wow. Look looking in.

Client 3: No. I... You know, one one interesting thing that I just discussed with the sales manager today is that this particular order seems the most dynamic ever since I joined the company, which is very interesting because the pandemic is is cooling off and we we have seen a huge break the pandemic started. But what would be the the major problems are we talking about the usability of the problems? Or are we talking about the general problems that the company may be dealing with or we think we may be dealing with.

Host 1: Either.

Client 3: So in the sense of a software solution, software solutions that we may be using. I would say that so far This has been the most organized sales theme that I have ever been part of. In the sense of every role has their responsibility, there are no expectations for one person to mix and match three roles in one, which we see a lot happening especially with startups. But when we talk about the problems in ten b that may you know, some team members may not be pulling as some as hard as some others, but that is very, very easy to recognize Another thing is that you know, sometimes marketing campaigns may happen to be a miss. And for those team members who are focusing on monthly targets, that can easily slip as as a month when we talk about targets. Overall. Company wise, you know, it may be the fact that we have seen a huge increase in demand when the pandemic started because a lot of companies can move towards working from home, so they wanted to track employee productivity as soon as possible. Now that the pandemic is says pretty much over. You know, it's difficult to to understand what could be another wave that we can write. But luckily, as I mentioned, this order seems to be the the most active one ever since. So I guess, not not not a bad situation we're in right now at all.

Host 1: You. I'm sorry. You mentioned what problem still, like, perhaps some in build that how some others that they did missed.

Client 3: Yeah. That could be that is not software related.

Client 3: About, you know, the the the talent acquisition challenges that may be happening, but you know, with smaller companies that is very easy to uncover and deal with if if necessary.

Host 1: Great. Awesome.

Host 1: Perfect. Alright. Well, I have no other questions. There exactly any less questions.

Host 4: So far, so good.

Host 1: Alright. Awesome. Well, thank you so much you dry. You have a great day rest of your day where you time today.

Client 3: Absolute pleasure. Thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of the day gentlemen.

Host 1: Absolutely totally. See you.
