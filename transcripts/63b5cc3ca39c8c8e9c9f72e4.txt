Client 2: Hi.

Host 1: Hey, Tiffany. Good to meet you.

Client 2: Good to meet you too. How are you today?

Host 1: Good. I'm good. Appreciate you. Hop on here. How was your holiday break?

Client 2: It was great I feel like it's always tough coming back from, like, very festive time and then you're just, like, in nun inundated with like so many things that you have to do that you're, like, well, catch up, you know we come back and it's, like, so many things.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. I think there's a bit of a a ramp up period for January.

Client 2: Yeah. I'm like, I'm ready for February already.

Host 1: I know that's gonna my like just get back, like the normal team.

Client 2: Your holiday?

Host 1: Yeah. It was really good. I'm up here. I'm in, Reykjavik. So we still got the cold weather, but you know, good to get together with the family I can't complain. Definitely, definitely was good to take some time off.

Client 2: Nice. Nice. Is it snowing where you are right now? Or it it typically snows it was snowing quite a bit, but actually all the snow gone right now.

Host 1: I can see a green grass. Yeah. A super weird for January. Christmas was white, and then now screen.

Client 2: That is very weird. Okay.

Host 1: Yeah. What I think we're our forty, forty degrees right now.

Client 2: So enjoy it.

Host 1: My... Yeah.

Client 2: Exactly. Wow. Okay. I know, so I'm in the bay Area. And then we're, like, going through a bunch of like arms. I like busted out my hunter boots for the first times since I moved here from the East coast. And I like wow. I finally, like, after a year and a half, I'm actually like, wearing these shoes again. Yeah.

Host 1: Is it is it like that that season is January winter ish the season for things like that I don't know from what I've heard from my coworkers who moved here, like, during twenty twenty.

Client 2: Like, this is the first time it's rain this much in the Bay Area. When I hear from friends, that like, have lived here like have grown up here. Like, they're like, oh, it's finally getting back normal. So I think it's even Francisco is typically a little bit rainy than than what I've gotten used to.

Client 2: Mh. But no. It's like natural, how much rain we've been getting in this sense that, like, New year's Eve, we had, like, a level two, like storm watch. Out of the like a level five system and there was, like, flooding in the streets. And, like, people's cars, like we're just stuck. People can drive on the freeway because it was completely flooded. And, like trees are falling down. Today's store. I'm not supposed to start at like, two Pm here. Like, a level five. And this is the first time they had level five since they came up with, like, the rating system, I think like, seven years ago. So I'm like, I wonder that's gonna be, like considering Saturday. It was not great.

Host 1: Yeah. A big shift to weather. We'll good luck. Good luck with.

Client 2: I'm I'm staying inside today. I like ran my errands earlier this morning before it it it starts to pick up. So Nice.

Host 1: Nice. Good. Cool. Well hope the best. Yes.

Client 2: Yes. I'm glad that you can see Green grass good.

Client 2: Enjoy that exactly.

Host 1: Yeah. Good positive things. There's always a silver lining I guess until until, you know, snow comes but hopefully a too vest.

Client 2: Yeah. My gosh. Okay. So I just wanted to give you a bit of back ground. I had met with Sam. I guess before she left throughout that end of, like twenty twenty one thinking, you know.

Client 2: We were interested in Orbit for twenty twenty two. Unfortunately, like it didn't shake out with our our budget. We weren't able to, like, budget this type of platform into twenty twenty two. We've now budgeted it for twenty twenty three, some sort of community building platform tool. My director and I were just a team of two within our, like, venture team here at Emerson. We were introduced to Orbit through Vc platform.

Client 2: Yeah. Sounds familiar With that partnership.

Client 2: But I was talking to Sam, also stop me if you need more background or you need less background. But it seemed like at the end of twenty twenty one, I'm with at my notes. There were some changes to tearing system, you know, originally, it was like, you only had a certain number of invites for, like, the month, then it changed into, like, you have no limit to, like, no number of engagements and, like, depending on the tier you got, like an x number of invites for the engagement. I'm a that they were or it was moving into, like, away from, like, the pilot program. So just kind curious what that looks like and a little bit background.

Client 2: You need or background on Emerson and the team? Or I think I got a little bit of details from what's Sam had left over from your conversation.

Host 1: It's good to note so it's a team of two you do have budget for this. And it sounds like maybe you you're familiar with, like, the demo of orbit. You need, like, any refresher on, like, the things that our platform does maybe only if there's been, like, major changes, I know, you know, there's like an algorithm you know, that they do and there's, like, certain questions that you can ask and there's only so much personalization that you you can put into it where it's like I think it was...

Client 2: You can't be like, I want these two people to definitely meet. Kind of like, depending on what their choices are. And a little bit of how we were planning to use it back then was you know, we invest in all these portfolio companies. Right? We're interested in creating the community among, you know, whether it's having a Ceo cohort or like marketing leader cohort or like a product leader cohort. You know, and just making sure that they're kind of matched up with each other. Depending on what they're interested in talking about. But and my initial conversations with Sam, it was like, I can put all of these people in here But depending on, like what they choose in their answers, this Ceo might be potentially messed up with, like, a marketing leader, which isn't what we wanted. But then I think that more I talk to her than it seemed like we can change like, In this engagement, we only want these people to be invited and that engage meant we want those people.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. We definitely stuff we can do... you know, we have been a lot of updates the products since twenty twenty one. If you had the conversations in twenty twenty two, No.

Host 1: Okay. We have Crm integrations. We have top recommended matches you can edit matches do a lot more data through Cs probably a lot of stuff I I could share with you, but the basics of the platform remain the same. So custom matching, you know, we can kind of ask everyone to opt in from your portfolio for your phone your your companies, then we can kinda segment them by know they're focus on marketing or hiring or finances. And then we can also segment them based on roles like only Ceo's to Ceos or only senior level of senior level. There are a lot of things that we can do So I don't know that has changed. Is that basically what what you knew about it going That sounds that's kind of new to me.

Client 2: Okay. All of these extra segmentation It seemed like originally, it was a lot more manual on my end of like, I just needed to, like, keep track of everyone who signed up and, like, assign like, certain, like, this is this person. This is that person. I just need to make sure I exclude like, the people that.

Client 2: So it seems like there's a lot new a lot... It makes it a lot easier.

Host 1: It would be helpful if I did, like, a a run through of some of the things that we have going on? Or is it better to chat on just go into the features that we're doing that maybe you and Sam didn't talk about.

Client 2: I think what would It sounds like all of the extra features Also, I'm pretty sure this is gonna be like a multi conversation My director is also out of office right now, but we're like we just wanna, you know, get this on our radar, so we can roll it out, if it matches, what we're looking for. I'm more curious in terms of, like, pricing. And stuff. You know, it seems like all the new features is really aligned with what we're looking for already. But I'm more curious, you know, like, if we did this, how quickly would it be rolled out? What would the pricing look like for x number of people, you know, we're trying to target certain functional rules this year and creating a community among that. And like what that would look like and how many invites we'd be able to have it that's still the system.

Host 1: Yes. Okay. Happy do. And if there's a point where said, it's just you and the director on the investment team. Right? Or or that's that's the total.

Client 2: So our investing team, we have people who like, are on the deal team and a focus on, like, making the my director and I were on like our portfolio so support team where we work directly with like, our portfolio companies, you know, providing them resource is answering questions, connecting them with other people, you know, putting together events and workshops. And one thing that we're trying to focus on this year like, community building, And that's just us too. Focused on it.

Host 1: Okay. Gotcha. And and how many portfolio companies do you have... I it looked like you're about twenty five. Is that accurate?

Client 2: No. We have over a hundred. What you see online is not fully you know, what we do. So Emerson collective it's for, like, the social change organization. We have a lot of different areas of focus and a lot of different teams focus guess on different things. So we have, like a team in Dc, focused on immigration policy. A team in the south the like racial equity and racial justice, a team in Chicago focused on like gun violence reduction, We have like, a grant team, and then we have like, our venture team. Right? And everything we do would keep pretty private. Our Founder and president is Lori Powell jobs. Steve Drops his wife and she is very much of the mind of, like, doing good behind the scenes and elevating the stories of, like, people we've invested in or Brands too versus putting the focus on her. Which is why we aren't really public on, like, who we've invested in.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: So we have over a hundred. What you see online is not show everything.

Host 1: Okay. And then and then the number of people that you'd wanna connect let's say, in an engagement, would that... It would be over a hundred, I suspect because you're gonna Is it just the founders It kinda depends, you know, I think depending on like what the price pricing turns out, like, it'll it might change like, who we wanna focus on.

Client 2: But we know a hundred companies between two people to manage as is a lot. So we kind of tier the companies, you know, in terms of, like, who which ones we wanna provide the most support to. So that's kind of how we would focus on it, you know, we might focus on, like, fifty marketing leaders. Right? At these companies, we might focus on, like, twenty five product leaders across like these other companies. So Does that provide the insight you're looking for?

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. I think I think it least gives me an idea of how many invites you'd be doing. Per month Mh.

Host 1: We work with a lot of Vcs. And I know maybe sam I mentioned that as well before, but there's a typical pricing range that that probably makes sense for number of occasions that you wanna do the typical amount of portfolio of companies. So I'm happy to share that pricing with you in terms of what's been updated. You now you can also share some added features that we have kinda going into detail on that. So And I don't I don't know exactly how it was in twenty twenty one, But right now we do one year annual contracts. And so the investment is typically ranging between six to eighteen k a plus an onboarding fee. So for, let's say, portfolio numbers of your size at a hundred. It would be five hundred per month paid annually? And then with that, you get a dedicated Cs team member, that get you set up within a couple of days, running your first engagement room within weakening allotted data, and then we set you up to run ongoing engagements throughout the year. Okay.

Client 2: So that's five hundred a month paid annually is that five hundred per company or five hundred total?

Host 1: Total. Total.

Client 2: So this would for our hundred port codes would just end up being six thousand. It seems like plus the onboarding fee. That's right. Okay. Sorry. Who uses eighteen thousand. How much are your company is that?

Host 1: That that is for communities of, you know, more than ten thousand and invites every a month. So we started of working with it Last seeing we're working with Silicon valley bank like, you say partners has quite a few engagement. So just... Just your level based on a lot of different things. And there's more features that you give as well. So we just rolled out actually, this year, group matching in addition to one to one. So with that till you also get group matching.

Client 2: What is group matching?

Host 1: So group matching is like one to one matching where use your a criteria, and we we matched them up one to one and send out invites for them to connect gain feedback. This is basically... We do groups or cohorts of maybe four to nine. So instead of one to one, you're gonna be in a group of, like, you know, five people. And if you have a hundred people we're gonna do what is that twenty groups of five? Debts how we're doing it.

Host 1: Same basic logic to it. A little bit more involved with it.

Client 2: Oh, that's awesome. For these conversations where it's like a group cohort Is it, you know, they're interested in in certain topic and then when they meet, they just kind of chat or is there a possibility for, like, my director and I to, like, also pop in and, like, help lead a discussion.

Host 1: There is that that possibility. So more often than not, it's just a group having a conversation with the group people. It's like like, mini mastermind, but we are starting to bring in, let's say, instructors or coaches to lead the cohort So if you wanna do something like that, yeah, we could set that up pretty easily. Okay.

Client 2: When instructors or coaches are brought in to have these conversations, Is it, you know, Orbit is bringing them in or is it the person that's organizing it is bringing in them in?

Host 1: It would be... It would be like, one of your investors or one of your mentor or something so typically, our our clients have the instructors like any learning platform like, we're we're starting to work with and they have, like, learners that connect with instructors.

Host 1: Instead of one groups. But we're just making sure the instructors meet up with different people every single time.

Client 2: Okay. Wow, That is awesome. That is really great to know. That is a a lot of what we are looking for it's, like, just the one to month connections, like putting together like cohorts and communities. If we get good feedback on, like, this group matching. They really enjoyed meeting together. Is it possible for that to be like a recurring thing or would it have to change every time?

Host 1: In terms of recurring, Do you mean with the same people or different people?

Client 2: The same people.

Host 1: We could do both. We could do the same people and we could we could change up so no one meets up with the same people every time or at least for next amount of times.

Client 2: Okay. That is so cool.

Client 2: The patching is there to me. I love that.

Host 1: That that is on our our pro in our premium. So that is where you're getting into like, twelve to eighteen.

Client 2: For group matching.

Host 1: Matching.

Client 2: Okay. That is really good to know Okay. So the six thousand is just for the five hundred a month. Is just one on one engagement.

Host 1: Right? Yep. One on one engagements you get up to three engagements per month, and then you get up to... You you have maybe five standard matching questions that you can use and then you have, like, up to one custom question that you can add in there. Okay.

Client 2: So for a total of maximum six questions.

Host 1: You probably have six or seven questions.

Client 2: Yep. Okay. Cool. And then So I'm only trying to organize my notes. It's a little easier. So that's under the six thousand if we do the group matching, you know, at the lowest amount of the twelve k, What is that? Like, what's the difference between in the twelve and the eighteen. And then does that still include just the one to one as well? And then does group matching number of engagements bleed into how many engagements we can offer for one to one.

Host 1: Yep. Okay. So when you go from the six k to the twelve k, you get to choose either one to one or a group matching. And so... And then you have up to four custom matching roles, I can send you a bit of a pricing sheet so you have all this stuff information you don't get it... You can take notes all so... But custom matching rules, you do seven matching rooms per month instead of only three still get a dedicated Cs, so you get branding, you get your colors. Everything is is there set up for you. Those are the main things. And you get more invites. So you have about five thousand more invites per month at that middle round. And then when you get to our premium at eighteen k, then you get both one to one and group matching. And they do... They do count as one of your engagements. And at that point, you have ten rounds. So you could do five one two one and five group per or up anyway that you want to, and you have unlimited matching questions. So a lot more flexibility at that premium level.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: There's there's no other stuff that we're doing like Crm integration we can give you the ability to edit your matches, we can give you the ability to we can recommend matches for you then you make the schedule. There's a lot of things that we're doing wise once you get up to that that pro premium tier. Okay.

Client 2: Good to know. I know you said in the six to twelve k range. Is at the pro?

Host 1: Six... So six is our essential twelve is pro eighteen is premium.

Client 2: Okay. So there's three three levels.

Host 1: Yep Okay. Right.

Client 2: For the pro one, I know you mentioned it five thousand more invites. How many invites is in the essential tier?

Host 1: Five thousand monthly.

Client 2: Okay. I don't think we need that money. That's why I I think you were like, oh, the five hundred one.

Host 1: Yeah. I think yeah I think with with the hundred portfolio companies, even if you ran you know, maximized everyone. Let's say it was triple out. Terms of people and do still fall in at five thousand Yeah.

Client 2: And then is that five thousand invites in total Right. So you would have to somehow split it up between the three engagements. Right? It's not like, five thousand per engagement.

Host 1: Yep. That's right. It's five thousand total.

Client 2: I just know my director gonna ask all these So I wanted to make sure I have all the answers. So then it sounds like with probably yet ten thousand invites.

Host 1: Yes.

Client 2: Across the seven rounds. Correct. Okay. And then how many is premium?

Host 1: Premium is over ten thousand. And it is ten matching rooms. Okay. So it's basically up to five up to ten and then overt ten.

Client 2: It's kinda like unlimited. Ash it's gonna be unlimited package.

Host 1: Yeah. Okay.

Client 2: It to know. Trying think what else so it seems like in any of these, you know, when we invite people to join the form is inviting them. To join, you know, is there a limitation to how many we can invite to join versus like how many people end up matching?

Host 1: It... Yep. It's it's the let's say five thousand on the essential, that is the total invites you can have. And then xml will opt in for these engagements.

Client 2: Okay. And out doesn't include how many actually sign up?

Host 1: It Ec correct. It's it's just... It's invites instead of people who actually get matched. People who actually hopped in to get matched. And everyone ops will get matched. But his total invites. I'm mean I'm I'm with the belief that five thousand not gonna reach it.

Host 1: More than it.

Client 2: Yeah. I'm not worried about that. But I know that that's gonna be asked regardless. So I'm like, I just wanna make sure I have, like, on my nuts and bolts, you know in place. I don't think we know five thousand people my gosh. Anyways, okay. That's good to know. Is there any custom branding at all in the essential one?

Host 1: Yes. You get custom branding with the central logo your colors your logo, you can customize everything and everything is coming from you, not from orbit. So that that's another thing. I don't know if this is something you and Sammy and talked about back in twenty twenty one, but there's no logins for your portfolio members your your community. We're simply a tool for you to use to communicate and get them to engage we don't want you manage. We're not a run a management platform. Okay. So they'll... If they opt in all of that information will be pre filled in for their next one. But we don't save that detail.

Client 2: So for us, how does it look like on the back end for us Are we able to see like this person, we sent thumb three invites they opted into two Of them. Like, is that saved on our portal, there just is in a portal for them.

Host 1: Correct. It is saved with you. So it's saved in members here. So you can see all the details of everyone that opted in, your your total, you can look at your audience and you can segment them anywhere that you want to. And then when you go into an completed engagement.

Host 1: Look. All the feedback that I've gotten from this particular engagement, and then I can go into the match. And so this is everybody that has matched up. This is the history of their mass and it's actually even the matching rating that they've given. So Kayla here She has done three matches and you can click on and look at her history. And look at her rating out of five that she gave those conversations it's up for every single engagement, you get this kind of data.

Client 2: Would I be able to see that same information for Kayla, I had just her members rather than going through engagements.

Host 1: We can see different information in the members tab, you're gonna only find this for Kayla if she has actually ran an engagement. So we keep that information in the engagement tab.

Client 2: Okay. But it seems like she's had three other engagements outside of, like, so if I So this one's the, like, November engagement, but the information if i But I wouldn't be able to find her in members. Right?

Host 1: So if I if I go to Kayla, Okay. I can only edit her information in her details that is the only thing I can do here. I can look at Like, we have tags. Like, if she's a super user, she's in three engagements this week.

Client 2: We there's a lot of things that we can do for tagging, and we can add her information here, but all that kind of data that you're looking for is gonna be in the engagements because that's where Yeah.

Host 1: We're we're feeling that type of data for...

Host 1: Wanna for the So I would need to know, like, she's done it once.

Client 2: But then I'd have to find her and whichever match she was in.

Host 1: What we can do is we can give you a report per per person, so you can download all of your your numbers we can also include all this data and, like, a Csv downloads or you think can use it with however you want to.

Host 1: But yes, you would need to know that she was in this particular engagement.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: Also have, like a main analytics dashboard. That's gonna tell you, like, overall across all of your audiences or you can filter by person or by specific audiences Yeah. This isn't we just pushed out there. A lot of good information for you. But what your portfolio is actually talking about how engage the across different segments. And then one more thing I'll train the back and in this completed engagement again, And maybe this is something to send me show you. I'm not sure. But you can look at the net promoter score, the average match rating, which is where asking them after the conversation ends. How good was this conversation one out of five? So this is a pretty strong matching round. You can look at your opt right here. And then you can look at who in your community was actually meeting up for this engagement. So it's mostly B versus B b to c, what topics were they discussing time zones, and then what topics do they wanna discuss? So you mentioned that you do events and workshops. You can add that type of detail in this feedback question Go, are you interested in our next workshop. Are you interested in this topic for this next event and then that can feed your programs and even these next engagements. And then, of course, frequency of being matched up. So we're setting up monthly matches because that's what they're telling us that they want.

Client 2: Okay. But then Are we able to, like, exclude that question? Because it seems like we can only have a certain number of engagements. Like, if they told us weekly, we are able to do weekly. It doesn't really make sense to give them that. Option. Right?

Host 1: We don't have to give that option.

Host 1: So once set up your your main engagement for your first rounds, let's just Let's just use I'll show you what the questions are. So these are the questions that you automatically get. This is your form that has all of your information that you can do it. So we can ask for role in company name. Linkedin and their phone number. We don't have to ask them these things, but they're available to you if you want to or what you get no matter what.

Host 1: You also get your gus topics so areas of interest, you can edit these. You can add add things and you can wipe them differently. And then you can ask for years of experience. You can ask for a company size company stage Series b.

Host 1: But you don't have to ask these if you don't want to these are what you get no matter what. And then on that it's a plan you get one custom matching question, you can add anything that you want to. So this is what you get on the very basic package.

Host 1: Guys got the feedback form. Sorry.

Client 2: No. That was still helpful. Thank you for walking me through that. I just wanna be mindful of time Do you still go a little bit?

Host 1: I I do if you do.

Client 2: I do... Okay. Yeah. I I can meet for about like, five more minutes.

Host 1: So i'll show you that question on the feedback form. So that would be the type of experience here. If I toggle this on, you can edit these and say, hey, we have a workshop coming up event coming up, and you can ask them that. You don't have to even the frequency, you can turn that on and off as well Are you able to, like, edit what that question says?

Host 1: You can you can add down the description here. But we wanna keep this in there for our purposes. So this is a pretty standard Again, you don't have to add it or if you wanna ask it a different way, you can add into a custom question here.

Client 2: Is there a limit to number of custom questions on the feedback form?

Host 1: You you'll get one. I can I can give you a maybe two on that without a big deal.

Client 2: Okay. That's good to know. Just why. And then one on the sign up.

Host 1: Yep.

Client 2: Great. And then you had mentioned that I'd be able to get like a Csv of like all the member data, you know, that's kind of in the engagement tab and then also kind of in the member tab. Is that something i'd have to request, or am I able to, like, download that on my own?

Host 1: You can download that you'd want you'll be working with our onboarding manager or Cs team so they'll know as so they can give you what you're looking for, but you can request that. And I believe you'll be able to download that whenever you want to. So they'll would just be a bottom them to this says exports to Csv. If you want that formatted anyway or changed different data. That's where our Cs team comes so we're doing that quite a bit. Are you using a Crm to manage members or portfolios at all?

Client 2: We use Salesforce.

Host 1: Salesforce. So we Believe we have an integration. We definitely have one with Hubspot and a affinity of the check in Salesforce. So if that's something that we had would that you interest you to to utilize.

Client 2: Oh, yeah. One hundred percent. Would our costs more or that kind of included.

Host 1: It would be a little bit in a addition We typically do it as an add. But let me let me chat with our team and see if that is even an integration that's ready And, yeah, I'm sure you can use a Csv in the meantime. And then once that gets pushed, we can see if it something that makes sense.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. I know I do a lot of manual things. Is there like, even anything in, like, air table? Or just really affinity and hubspot.

Host 1: We integrate with a lot. Let me let me check an air table as well. I've gotten that request quite a bit. Let me double check out.

Client 2: Okay. Cool. Because I know we have our own product team and they build out a lot of integrations for us. So I'm like, I mean, we just don't have contracts with Hubspot or affinity, but I'm, like, we use their tables. Of like, information is pushed into an table that I'm sure our team can push that into Salesforce.

Host 1: Our product... Our product team is super happy work with you on setting up those interventions.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. Great. I think next steps if you can send me, you know, the pricing tiers, you know, and this conversation of with my director and plug in, you know, any additional details. And then maybe set up a conversation between me year and her. She has any questions. Got it. But I'm sure she will. She's so thorough, which is great. A little bit about us too and is really important to us is, like the sensitivity bitty of our data, you know, in the information that you start to collect of the people that are we're sending invites to. It's kind of like who owns that data. You know, this orbit own it, do we own it Do you have any insight into that?

Host 1: You and the data So it's your members we're just a tool for you to organize this in way that you want to? And we're stock too certified. So we take a lot of care and our customers and our clients data even when they're connecting through our platform for for chat. So, yeah. Definitely get that question quite a bit. Is there any specific document that you'd be looking for there?

Client 2: Did you know the soc two certification went through? Sam told me that when we last boat that you were still in the middle of it. For us, we would just need to sign, like, a lot of contracts on the legal side. And I kinda need to work with our legal team about that. I don't know anything about Soc two certification.
