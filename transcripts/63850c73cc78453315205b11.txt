Client 2: Hey, What's up, Dak.

Client 2: How's the holiday.

Client 3: I was good man. Good to get some. Rest stays in now. Back to it. What about you.

Client 2: Nice. Yeah. It's fun down in La with some family and now back nostin but yeah, I get to get some days off.

Client 3: Where the Airports? Crazy.

Client 2: Honestly, I think I lucked out. I just like. Non crazy times so it wasn't too bad for me.

Client 4: Said you're in La with the family. George.

Client 2: Yep, yeah. A couple ants and cousins out there.

Client 4: What's up? Selwyn? Sefal.

Client 5: Yeah.

Client 4: Always here on time.

Client 4: How do we get rid of this thing? Can I kick this thing. I'll leave it for now. How's everyone's iron break any highlights.

Client 6: Cornbread was on green.

Client 4: Nice.

Client 6: Jalapeno. With little chunks of corn. On a steel. It. Was Bond, biggoty.

Client 4: All right.

Client 7: Thanksgiving.

Client 4: Thanksgiving.

Client 4: Let's see here. So Evan stick. He's not able to join any power through it. Call the smarten, but the guy sounds like me the last couple weeks. So we're gonna let him. Dress up. Let's see here. I'm just paying in so she should be jumping on. She got a call, so she should be on here any second. And then Rabindranath. Similar just give off a call cool. Let's do this since we have some people. Right actually said that his calls running really late. Let's just go ahead for those who are here. We'll get messy guys. So what we're going to go through today. Is. A very important icebreaker about your faith their favorite things giving side dish. It's the staple of Mosaic culture. So we have to ask Monday after Thanksgiving. And then quickly we'll get into. Some updates on kind of the end of the Quarter, where we're looking at numbers wise and then updates on deals that are possible for November. So hopefully a pretty tight list that we're tracking there. We actually have a log in place, so we'll go through everything and then just call out some where you'd help this week. So I pull up the report. We'll go in order. Here. And we will get. Messy. Cool. My screen. Here. Let me refresh this. I have some late updates coming in. Cool. Awesome. Let's go and order here. Selwyn. You'll be up first and slid is not here yet. Again favorite Thanksgiving side dish and feel free to just hit on these deals. If anything again, it's not working on. Please get a bit and then also, please push it out. But we'll go through just what you're targeting. I know we've got an update from you pretty much late Wednesday, so we're probably in locks up on these, but just want to see what else is new and yeah, feel free to jump in. Shot.

Client 5: Yeah. So immutable you're in the lube. So they got back to us with, you know, additional comments after our first round of security comments. So working through those.

Client 4: Good, Santa. Let's get back to you on this.

Client 5: Not yet, you know, they're they're in Australia, so nothing's really happening until, like.

Client 5: Five, six P. M. Tonight. Anyways. But. Yeah.

Client 4: So waiting on here, back if you don't hear back by then, or maybe like two or three, just flag it to Frodo and myself and a thread just because we'll want to nudge the infection on that, since that's a big one sitting out there. So yeah, just plug that to us if you don't get any feedback here in the next few hours.

Client 5: Yeah, for sure. And then. Depending on what Santosh writes up, might want to run it by our. Champion first. Just to see if there's anything that he's worried about, that we can maybe get in front of with the security team instead of just doing everything over email.

Client 4: Yep. I mean, I would say my read on that is that we should be boosted. Totally. Fine. Yeah. They're asking about. Pretty immaterial stuff. So I imagine it's probably just our process if we say it's on the roadmap to ask when and all that. So yeah, I suspect we're tracking well, there, but.

Client 7: Am I hearing this directly? Immutable is good in month just final redline stuff.

Client 5: We got without red lines, and now we're just working through. Security questions. So we had the first rally of questions, and then they had follow ups after our so I don't imagine there would be too much more after we get these answers.

Client 7: And you need Santosh, do you have his attention? Or do you need, like, a nudge.

Client 5: We got his attention this morning. He just said, you need to work through a couple things. So yeah, could might need an extra nudge. If he doesn't respond, you know, next couple hours.

Client 7: All right, let me know.

Client 6: Shauna, these are the ones that are nonstandard. Back in our questionnaire because like Shantosh and I work through, like about 150 questions.

Client 5: These were just a few specific points. That day that they got back to us on about. Single signon. And Seim, and a couple like data. Storage policies.

Client 4: Yeah. No similar questions that wouldn't be addressed by that Al. One that might have been Shawn was like the notification of like, incidents, but outside of that, they were kind of just like, follows on like roadmap for delivery, on some sort of stuff.

Client 4: Cool. Good room. Might have, though. Yeah, we do have that security questionnaire that's been should bans, or probably 90% of those questions that we get. So thanks for the plug there.

Client 6: Yeah. Monkey bands. That too, right. We can just expand this.

Client 4: Yeah for sure. Cool. Awesome. Jericho. Feel free to jump in on anything else you're tracking here. Looks like we got. Our favorite company, Soogrim. Steve Flies.

Client 4: Yeah, it's on your radar.

Client 5: Yeah. So that one. This one could be a quick win. Honestly. It's you know, Kalen from Convert Kit. You know, I just quoted her over email and she was like, oh, is there anything you can do for, you know, like brief customer, like Bubba, blah. So we're chatting later today. At. Four sorry 330 so might get some good news from that one. Just for kind of like a quick turnaround. He said she wanted to be up and running in December, so this one actually has, like a decent chance. I think. Yeah, but just heard back from her this morning. So made that up. But. Could be done.

Client 7: He's been good to us. Jericho said, do what you need to do to get her to sign. And then we have a really good story to just highlight all the repeat customers.

Client 5: Yeah, definitely. She'll definitely sign. Just trying. You know, keep goes. Acvs, up. Yeah. And yeah, and then we have the Lambda Allen, I have the Lamb to call tomorrow, too, so that one could be a quickish turnaround. But I think it would just be tough to get Lambda done in one great, as we haven't even breached security or legal reviews, but.

Client 5: Have that kind of final call with Lambda tomorrow too.

Client 4: Yeah, and that would be not in this month. It looks like opportunity wise. I would agree there if that's the case.

Client 5: Yeah, I don't. I don't have it in the month. That's just the one I'm last one. I'm gonna track.

Client 4: Cool. Yeah. I think it makes sense given that we stole our, like, basically just find the value of the tool and got to, like, those advanced pricing. Or contract. Later discussions. I'm aligned through there. Awesome. Cool. Anything else you're tracking? Or is that a.

Client 5: No. Cool.

Client 4: Let me do one quick thing here, guys. Sir, I'm getting my second monitor. Just shut down. Doing something.

Client 7: Selwyn did good. What happened with glance.

Client 5: Glance. Go one of the points of contact left. So they are he just got extra stuff on his plate. So that one is just in December now. I got some background info from the guy. Andrew. At the moment, they aren't concerned about planfuls implementation process, but I want to bring Rafa or someone in on the call just to be like, Dude, you should be worried about this, like you're one person and trying to implement this tool. But yeah. So that one got to delay it a little bit as far as like when they're making a decision.

Client 7: Cool. Then nothing from straight.

Client 5: Nothing from Stream. I sent them an email this morning. It looked like they were engaging with it a little bit more, but, yeah, that one kind of fell off the map pretty quickly.

Client 7: Cool, thanks for that date.

Client 4: Cool. All right, guys, let me share my screen back. We'll we'll keep moving here. Selwyn, did we get your favorite Thanksgiving side dish.

Client 5: Oh, it was the Mac and cheese. Baked Bake, Mac and cheese, you know, three, three or four cheese, little Jalapeno. Great, great. You know, great role player. There.

Client 4: Yeah? Pick Mac and cheese? That's hard to hard to mess up. All Right, cool. Awesome. Selwyn. Thank you. Leaandra, you're up for context. We're just walking through deal updates for November, so I know we just did this Wednesday afternoon. You and I, but just kind of swinging back on any updates there. And then where you need help this week and then your favorite Thanksgiving sideish from this Thanksgiving, ideally.

Host 1: Okay. Quick note. I emailed him this morning. He's meeting with Enrique. Today that he said this morning, but he's at the time. And I'm gonna get me an update by this afternoon. So that's looking good. Haven't had any issues that could come up there. In the deadline for that is tomorrow. And then align.

Client 4: I just move real quick.

Client 4: Real quick, Leaandra. What probability would you put on that? You think quick, note.

Host 1: I think it's commit. Yeah. Okay, sure.

Client 4: Cool.

Host 1: That one was one that I did like the 30 Day from Demo and they like really aligned to it so highly recommend people using that more. I haven't been consistently using it, but I'm probably gonna try to because it seems real and. They're like seem urgent around it. Alliance. Just sent back the red lines. I feel like it should be fine. So that one. We already got the verbal. So I just moved that to legal security. Sign off just now.

Client 4: Hopefully. That all looks good.

Client 4: We're accepting a lot there, so they should be fine. I imagine.

Host 1: Cool. Eight base. We have a call later today. You're on it. But I don't think you've accepted yet. Oh, you just said in her mind. And I talked to Caleb and Gertude. They did want to scope it, so we have a scoping call set up for tomorrow. At 08:00, a.m.. Pacific. But all should be good. I mean, you were on that call. I think that doing the free months and moving to January, start date. Pretty much going to do it for that one.

Host 1: No.

Client 4: And then do we have any feedback? Does since that call at all. I'm just curious because I know that he saw it was seeking some approvals. Is that how do we feel there.

Host 1: I haven't. Oh, I have some emails I haven't seen yet. I haven't heard anything. Let me. I don't think I've heard anything. Back from him.

Host 1: We need to do a scoping colony accepted the call. So.

Client 4: Okay. Cool. I mean, it's lined in, like six business hours since we met with him. So I understand. For us because still thought there was still a little bit together on his side, but obviously was trending.

Host 1: Well, so cool. Yeah. We can find out later today and then anchor the toss up from our last call that you and Frodo were on. It seemed like they're kind of not aligning to end of month. They were. Yeah? I just don't know if they'll be ready in time. But I have to reach out to her tomorrow. So gonna do that. And probably gonna just offer them sweatshirts. Since it was a topic of conversation last time. But yeah, I'm not really banking on that one, but, you know, there's still a chance. And then Climate club.

Client 4: Real quick. Sorry. I was on anchor. Did we did we try to set up the call with Frodo and our girl, who we've described as lost.

Host 1: Is that correct? I think Frodo sent her a side note, right?

Client 7: Yeah. We definitely we had that call last week and Lost is putting it nicely. So I'll keep the pressure on with my contact there and her. But. These guys, their heads are in the cloud, so probably not November.

Host 1: Okay, cool.

Client 4: They manage to spend $100,000 and don't buy a plane tool. Then we need to speak to their boss.

Client 4: So, yeah, let's say I've been from their own self.

Client 7: Cassie might just spend it on mushrooms.

Host 1: Who knows.

Host 1: Yeah. Climate club. Last I heard from Jebediah was that. He wants to wait on buying anything. I sent his the CEO, who was the one who reached out Frodo over like the XYZ email thread. The meeting that we had scheduled for today. And he said maybe to it. And then after that, Jebediah declined this morning. So it's looking like a no, but I sent them like a. I sent him an email being like, hey, this is what you were concerned about. Doesn't really make sense how you're gonna wait on this? Because nothing you're you guys are doing. Is useful. But I'm gonna send another email and just be like, hey, can we still have this meeting or not? But. I'm not this one's looking like a no.

Client 7: Okay. Let's connect. Maybe there's the way to save it.

Host 1: Yeah. I think maybe going around Zacket, because so that started like two weeks before he started this sales cycle. And he said a couple times now that he's, like, worried about making a huge purchase. And, you know, he's new and he's scared about his job. So that seems like that's the issue. So if we can, like, get some, like, CEO buyin, then I think it'll help a lot. But as of right now, Jebediah is seeming to try to do this by himself.

Client 4: Cool. I'd say if we don't get any movement today, Leaandra, on this one, let's let's push it out. Just given the short runway here, we should definitely push that out in November.

Client 7: For sure. That's not it's not going to be in November.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 4: Let me check my notes here for you. Yeah. Tracking the same cool. Awesome. They were dish from this weekend side dish only.

Host 1: I always love crayon very sauce. That's my favorite.

Client 4: Just a spoon and a bowl of sauce.

Host 1: Just on a little bit of everything.

Client 4: Getting too hungry? Should it not? Question at eleven. Awesome. Cool this, Selwyn. Thank you, Nick. You want to go ahead and jump in here on yours.

Client 3: Yeah. Ever stream is actually like looking unlikely now even though we had the December. 20 or sorry. November 23. Commit to sign if we got them what they needed to on price. He pushed out because he had said, hey, the meeting with the board didn't go as expected as we expected to I need a little bit more time. Which I thought we had to get a runaway. Then I just kept blasting him. Since. Last Monday. With some text and emails just got back to me this morning after I followed up. He said. We're still working through our model last Monday, added a lot of complexity to our 2023 cost goals. I'm resubmitting to them on a Wednesday this week and should have an update for you. Mosaic is still my platform of choice. This is a budget approval delay. So this one will slip but I mean, good to hear we're still the platform of choice. I always knew it was gonna come down to costs, and if they'd get it bored, approved. So I just responded back like, hey, thanks. I know we had given you the approvals for the commit for the November sign, but appreciate the update so I can get out in front of this with my leadership. So more to come later in the week, but as it looks like it'll slip.

Client 4: Yeah, I know. We kind of had this bucketed in, like the Hail Mary Bucket. We're chatting on Wednesday. I'd say probably kick it out, giving that feedback. And it can be on that. We're probably very much so pulling that in.

Client 3: So.

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 4: Gold, and then v. Seven. So.

Client 4: Finally, it's $40 million. So they can buy a $20,000 piece of software. It sounds like, yeah.

Client 3: So got on the phone with her, just said, Hey. If you want the same approvals that we gave you last time. We'll need to sign this in month. And do the opt out. I'm curious on your end and maybe we can sync up boss line later about this if we include just the legal review opt out or the DPA because she did have some questions on our call like hey, will the terms have you know, broken out? So W of you know what? We're going to be getting week to week. I just. Talked her off that and said, like we're not a typical. Like, there's no typical. So W because we've pre built integrations, and it's not like, hey, we're doing this on this week, and building this integration this week, it's again, like, we pre built them, so everything's really tailored. Had some questions about. You know our SLAs this that so I may want to pick your brain on what we include on that. Ideally, I just want to do the opt out for terms, but don't want to hit a snag. Heading in a tomorrow knowing they're already day ahead. So we can chat about that offline.

Client 4: Yeah, grab, grab me. We could put a contract together that at least has the main stuff called out, like the SLA language, like the DPA attached and all that. And then yeah. If there's any red lines that would come back pretty immaterial. Most likely. Yeah. As long as you're from a business terms and then send them what they need. That should be should be okay. There.

Client 3: So Yeah.

Client 4: Walk through that.

Client 3: And then lastly, another Hill. Mary, I've been blasting on fleet. Last week and was like, hey, he's just that weirdly. Asked me like, hey, what were next steps? And I was like, I have been paying you over email all last week and texting you what those are. But he just pinged me today said, Hey. Can we connect tomorrow? I need to review the contract and get it over to legal. Last week I had given him the contract with the Opt Out, hoping we could maybe get this in month because I said if you guys want the two free months like we had discussed in November sign. So that's a win for us if we can just do. The. Legal review Opt out. So we're gonna get on his calendar. This one's gonna be tight. But, I mean, he has approval on the price and approval to sign. He just busy that he just never. So, yeah, I'm pushing.

Client 4: Yeah, I had kicked it out.

Client 3: Okay. I thought it was lost, but it could knock in.

Client 4: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. I mean, this this is a game changer for the month. Frankly, it's just out there size and it'd be a really good deal for us. I know it's like, well, scoped. And we put a lot of thought into this. When we've got about V seven contract maybe let's come up with maybe a play for oddsley because like if we get approved and sign is ready to go and it's all TS and C to me he doesn't always seem like to think God, that's gonna get held up by that. So. Cool. Let's shot it right after this on V Seven in that.

Client 3: Cool. Yeah. Those are those are the updates there for me.

Client 4: Awesome. Cool. What was your favorite ass I did for the weekend.

Client 3: I always go with the it's like nothing crazy. But my Grandma always has the Pillsbury, Doe boys. You know, what are they. The bread.

Client 3: Like the bread, the rolls. Yeah. And then I just make a little sandwich out of pretty much everything.

Client 3: So I'd say that's gonna go to you your favorite side.

Client 7: That you're making.

Client 4: Yeah, Yeah. That's all separate call getting all the Nick's bets from the weekend. We'll do that maybe icebreaker for future Thanksgiving. Cool, good updates. Awesome. Let's keep moving here. Rabindranath, How's. Ort. Wait. Why not? I didn't jump in yet. I was just taking a man.

Client 7: Cool. Almost. Keep moving. Close the deal. This morning. I signed it.

Client 7: Was one that I did not recognize. Let me get you the name.

Host 8: Oh, it was.

Client 4: Yeah. I said a few that were.

Client 7: Called.

Client 4: Oh, I talked it, Yeah. Wow, that way that really came in. Wow.

Client 4: They said it was looking good, but we haven't always started the process. So amazing. Wow. Cool. All right, guys, we can go ahead. Let's see here. Yeah. Perfect. Everyone's gone so far. While I'm just tracking my notes here, just want to update everyone on a few things first. Is that. Actually before I do this. Any calls you guys have on the books you want support on feel free to think outside just a month, obviously with Thursday or Friday. Anything on the agenda. You guys want to make sure you have support on. Frodo, Myself. Otherwise. You guys take a quick look. Here.

Client 3: Cool.

Client 4: I'll Ping you guys on some then I definitely got the availability to jump on some calls, particularly on kind of Thursday morning. So I will slack some of you guys on some there. But just to update where we're at on the month. So we really are turning towards a pretty solid month especially given the holiday. I think if we hit 450, it's a completely reasonable goal. Frankly, we have the deals and then some based on what was called out today. Obviously, some meaningful updates coming today. With a base quick node and some others or it's probably being on that list as well. On Rabindranath's side.

Client 7: So.

Client 7: Where are we.

Client 4: Just headed up. We're at 315 and then with Earth 312, that is, and then with Rabindranath seal. I believe I Docket was a good. 27 car or something like that.

Client 7: Let me pull this up. 25. Let me check.

Client 4: Yeah I believe it was above average loose.

Client 4: Man? Yeah, we're definitely. This is been the best fifth as far as structure I think. Cool, so. Yeah, we're at says yes, the 312 plus Rabindranath's deal. So call it. 340. And that's with you know. And what we'd consider, I would consider committed. That's trending toward. Yeah. I mean, that would put us that for 50, basically, with what we have just committed, that's not including things like Scots, or, you know, anchor Matic Menglement, vitally on sleep. So the upside is absolutely there. Guys. And taking a step back. That is what I want to kind of lay out. And I mean, first it's I can't lay this out without acknowledging that it definitely felt like this. That really feels like we've been closing the quarter for several weeks now, and I do want to acknowledge that like we heard this from prospects. Like and if something has. Your guys leader. I love to hear is that people like, are you guys? Is your quarter end now? Like, you know, you guys are really pushing deadlines hard, like this. And they're buying into, like, our kind of aggressive cadence. And it's just great. Like this is something that we definitely need to maintain. I think it's been huge for our consistency and not having, you know, just really stalled months like we did in previous months. And now we have a really attainable goal for what you know, we laid out as our stretch goal at the beginning of the ear, not our stretch goal, but our formal goal of one 3 million at the beginning of the jump here. So depending where this month's finishes, we might want to bump that up a little bit. Just make sure we're still kind of reaching for the stars. But yeah, I just did want to acknowledge it. That kind of drive you guys are putting on your deals here is definitely resonating with prospects, as we can see from the consistency. And frankly, it's what success looks like the next few weeks, because we have very limited selling days before. Prospects will be checking out. While done here guys in the updates. Frodo and George for Rabindranath's updates. I'll have him. I'll just connect with him right after this and thank you guys with some meaningful updates on his site. I've had some stuff in motion that would be worth updating you on. But last call is here helping the team making you guys need.

Host 1: Denisha, I just got an update from QuickNotes, so I might have you on another call.

Client 4: Okay. My parent or is it?

Host 1: Yeah. He said so. I don't know why, but the VP of Science has not been involved in this process at all. And he finally watched the demos, and they're just worried about their NetSuite integration or implementation. He was like, Well, he's like, super supportive the tool, but hesitant to dive in now because of where we are regarding our NetSuite integration. Mainly around how would they be useful if we didn't have Net Suite connection in place? Limited data coming from Net sleep means when ZEC won't be as productive, so they're slated for January 31, start date. Sounds like you might have to potentially just say that we're flexible around when they can start just because they are implementing that suite. But he has to get on a call, so I just sent him my calendar link.

Client 4: Cool. Yeah. I can speak to that. That should be pretty straightforward. Cool. Okay. Yeah. Let's get. A line prior about going into that one, but I imagine we can overcome, but I mean, they're looking at it probably thinking it's December now with a month or so to get to where they need to be from Mosaic. It's probably a fair point of pushback and something that we can hopefully overcome, but yeah, not ideal.

Client 4: Cool any other.

Client 7: Guests still live.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean, it's essentially like we're kind of mincing words over what a trial looks like. Or I should say mincing words over what like our termination language in our agreement is and what it allows you to do versus like if they want to angle for a trial at a higher price. So how to call it them. Last week and essentially getting them a writeup on what we will and want to do a certain price ranges. To fix their business case document working with Evan on that. And then they also want to plug in their data prior. So it's yeah, it's not coming in this month, just given the amount we have to do there. I think they'll be a customers, but they're paying the ass prospects. They'll be ready to implement and be all hands on deck. But for the sake of being across the line.

Client 4: Awesome. Cool guys. So we'll end it briefly. Give you a few minutes back. It's obviously endemonth. Push. Here. Let me know what you need. All disposal are all resources that you guys disposal. Frodo, myself, George. Otherwise, to jump on calls, let us know what you need and hopefully you guys on jumping on some calls tomorrow and afterwards. But appreciate it. Thanks guys.
