Host 1: Hello? Hi Amanda.

Amy Winehouse: Are you doing How are you?

Host 1: Good meet. Thanks for being flexible in timing. I know you're you're in Hong Kong right now.

Amy Winehouse: So.

Host 1: The time difference.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm I'm I'm glad to meet you. Thank you for reaching out.

Host 1: Yeah. Definitely. You used to these late time several times. Targeted over the world?

Amy Winehouse: That's pretty standard. Yeah.

Host 1: I was I was... I'm going I I love hong kong.

Amy Winehouse: It's it's a it's a bit of a difficult time for Hong Kong, but it's we're we're sort of on the the better end of things, I guess. So I I think, yeah. China is is still sort of dealing with a lot of zero Covid drama, but Hong kong is kind of on the other side. So it's Yeah. We're it's it's it's actually pretty good here. I would say now.

Amy Winehouse: Finally so kind of rough three years.

Host 1: It's no. I've always wanted to visit Hong Kong. It's first on my list to visit when I go to try.

Host 1: So I need to make it though. It's...

Amy Winehouse: It's it's in the amazing city. The food is great. That's people are very interesting, architecture, public transport, bag amazing beaches of making. Yeah. If this a it's a very cool question.

Host 1: Beaches isn't Hiking but moe inbound It it's coastal as well.

Host 1: So I thing.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very So definitely if you can come you know, from November to March, it's much better. Otherwise, she'll be very hot. But Yeah. It's it's regardless list at the three. A very sound place to visit, but I I wouldn't come right now because there are still... My mom came actually two weeks ago, but we aren't... Like... And it was it was fine, but she had to do, like, Covid test every day and there's, like, us to upload your stuff.

Amy Winehouse: So, like, it's not not... We're we're not ready yet. My mom my mom did it, but only because she's related to me. So Got it.

Amy Winehouse: Got it.

Host 1: Okay. We're originally I'm from California.

Host 1: California. Got it. Okay. I'm Reykjavik. I think we have a... We have a couple of team members in in California you right now, we're a bit spread.

Host 1: We're based in New York. But i way. Other way, it's good to know. And and they on here. You know, I reached out it looks like pioneer academics has some really great things going on. I think the Orbit tool could be really used full. So... Yeah. Appreciate you know, having a chat. I'd love to kind of share some stuff we have going on and see if there is some potential for even a partnership here.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. No. That sounds good. You know, I I work with our community engagement program, so that includes programs that we run for our current students as well as our nice. So we have five thousand alumni who have participated in the program in the past ten years. We do run, you know, different kind of engagement programs for them, like live love alumni panel, we have a a a linkedin alumni group And and I would say they've been you know, sort of successful. We have an online podcast. We have, you know, an know online newsletter. So so there's stuff that we do. I would say that, you know, it kind of it pale and can Pearson to what a university would offer alumni, but That's they're there's sort of it's a relatively new, you know, initiative only really been working on it for two years. So there's a lot of space to grow. There's it's an interesting group of people very talented students know most of them at in the really, really top universities. So it's it's There's a lot of potential. I think we've kind of started to to kind of make inroads. Right? But there's there's a lot more that we can do and I I think that kind of the big question, especially with big volume of of the alumni right, like, what's going to be the most impactful at actually bringing them together and enabling them to support each other without me having to kind of, you know, personally connect each person to know, to to each opportunity or other illinois.

Host 1: Yeah. I mean, speaking of that, how how is that going? You're you're doing some manual connections, right? Very difficult thing at scale. But how was that... How is that going for you right now? How much time you spend on that every month.

Amy Winehouse: Right. It's an interesting question. I mean, we That's that's sort of the on my side. We also have our current students right and and the programs for current students are are easier. I mean, I I started those well also pretty recently, but those are much more stable, both are are are kind of easier to to run. That takes look the fair amount of my time and and then the alumni stuff, at this point have taken a little bit less because I've chosen to focus more on the current students, because that's kind of the the the most urgent I already on my stuff. I mean, altogether, I would spend probably I don't know. Maybe maybe ten ten hours to fifteen hours a week and it kind varies. But know not all of it is is it's super manual. Some of it is organizing events that that that many people might attend. Right? Other things if it comes up, like, oh, interesting, you know, you have this in common with this person, like, I'll connect you. You know, it it it that would depends. But it it does you know, especially with the big group, but it it takes a lot of time to actually kind of, you know, think about okay, what's gonna be useful and interesting for these people where they feel like, it's actually worth staying engaged with pioneer when they have, like, the yale on the network or they have the of my network. Right? So we we have kind of a high bar to to compete.

Host 1: Yeah. That is that's interesting. You're looking at it as a bit of a competition in terms of the network, which, you know, it makes complete sense, I guess, the more connected us started the better.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. Because, you know, they're they're busy. They they have often they are, you know, recipients with other big awards that also have their own alumni programs. Right? And and how many things can they engage right? That there's only so much time that they have. Right? And so they're gonna sort choose the program that provide the most valuable value value to them that are the most interesting. Right? So. You know, I think we do have to think about capturing their attention.

Host 1: Definitely. How many current students are enrolled like at any given time. Because you see you have five k alumni, Is there like, every summer or how often are does this moment take place?

Amy Winehouse: Every year, there's again another thousand.

Host 1: Oh wow. So, like, at, any given time, you're basically connecting yourselves and people as a current student.

Amy Winehouse: Right.

Host 1: Okay. That's... I mean, that Yeah. I suspect ten to fifteen hours, you know, that's that's what it would take to connect them.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. And I mean, that doesn't even really, you know, that's not making much of an impact. Right? It's it it can provide a deep impact for for a few people. Right, and and you know, some people will attend to them right, but but it's you know, if there's If it it is not easy to sort of you know, think about what to do with with that volume.

Host 1: You're and you're doing it all remotely because you're based in Hong Kong suspect your students certainly in the Us at these top schools and eighty six countries I seen the world right now.

Amy Winehouse: Right. So, yeah. The students are all over. I would think most of our alumni go to the Us. A fair amount go to the Uk. We have others who in Australia and even you know, other countries But but but I would say probably, like, eighty percent go to University in the U us. Yeah. And their their home countries would be. Yeah. Absolutely everywhere.

Host 1: Got it. And then just a quick question on tuition. Obviously, there's a tuition every year. Every student pays tuition, basically, all thousand of them when they come in, Is that?

Amy Winehouse: Basically, but we're public benefit corporation, so twenty and of students are are receiving need based financial aid.

Host 1: Okay. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Either way, that's that's.

Amy Winehouse: And they pay... They pay for the program. We don't charge anything for or alumni programs. I mean that's something that that we've considered. Right we couldn't charge for certain programs, we're not at that. Stage yet. They they paid one.

Host 1: Got it. And so I I can cross this pioneer research program, is that specifically like the program, Is that just one of many programs.

Amy Winehouse: It it is our first program that you could consider it, like, the flagship program. We are potentially launching other programs, but they are not. Official, not on the website yet. But that is something that we are considering doing.

Host 1: Got it. And so this is the main thing that you're you're basic like Right.

Host 1: Is the main is connecting students to students or students to instructors or how do you wanna make those connections?

Amy Winehouse: Right. Also the the program itself is really about supporting students in writing an undergraduate level research paper. Right? So so they are in a program that supports them in doing that. Right? It's it's challenging for high school to do it, right? So there's a bunch of different ways that we support them. Right? So they they have some of our classes with their professor they have one on one sessions with their professor they also have additional resources that support them in that process. Though there are many kind of, you know, resources in the program that them the ultimate goal is that they they didn't write this original research paper that contribute to their academic field. So they are not research assistants, helping the professor. They are actually the ones coming up with the idea and and then actually doing it. So That's the main goal of the program. What community engagement does is quite different. Right? Because we're working during while the students in the program we are providing additional learning opportunities for them to connect with alumni, so they'll eliminate kind of return as not really a Ta. I mean, they're not it's not a formal role. Right? But the deal i are sharing So the students students have have formal opportunities. So to connect with the alumni and other students and ask questions and get it advice from the alumni. During the program, they have that exposure. We have to be those those connections have to be really carefully monitored because the students are our current students, they are minors, the alumni are generally adult. That is very dangerous, lots of lawsuit potential. So so they can only interact an official proctor online chat. Right? Like, we cannot connect students and alumni by email. Many students have asked. Right? Like, i have mentor work can I, you know, contact the alumni on my own. They can unofficially obviously through Instagram, but I cannot connect. An under eighteen percent to an over eighteen person. Like, that's a big no no.

Host 1: Okay. So you... So you're just... You're very curated in terms of who your next.

Host 1: But once you connect them, obviously, they have their their contact information they meet up. That you need to provide everything that you can.

Amy Winehouse: Why different. So if it's for current students, they would only be meeting alumni in specific online forum that we proctor. Right? And so the alumni can share their information there, and and we can say do you wanna reach out to the alumni. You can reach out. But I wouldn't phrase it as I'm connecting them. That's not okay. In in the online space, they can every breakout really needs to be proctor by an adult... Right? We have to monitor it very closely. The alumni are free to put in their contact information, the student can choose to reach out, but we cannot encourage them to reach out or you.

Amy Winehouse: Sure. Definitely not forced them too. So that we can provide shouldn't. So when when they're still student they get they they're introduced to the alumni. Right? And and they have access bill on my podcast.

Host 1: Right?

Amy Winehouse: You but it's only when they're alumni. That there are fewer restrictions. Right? And and when when everybody in the night, they're not our student anymore. It... There's not the... We don't have the same legal over responsibility. Right? Like, if if we connect to students and and there's some kind of, you know, right. Awful thing happens, that's not going to be possible to really trace back to Pioneer. Like, we we just connected you. You reached out on Instagram. That's not. Right? So it went... In in terms of alumni connecting to a long i we can have a linkedin to alumni group. They can connect. We can introduce them their adults. We don't need to worry about that.

Host 1: Got it. Okay. Yeah. I think there's some interesting things that that we have So curated knowledge sharing, you connect them based on interest and in topics.

Amy Winehouse: Yeah thing.

Host 1: How many how many students in alumni connecting let's say a monthly basis.

Amy Winehouse: Right now. Not that many only very ad hoc. Maybe five. Right? Like, no. That's not a big part of my job. That's just like if I happen to be, like oh, my gosh. Like you, you know, maybe for the illinois podcast it's a bit more, so it might be a high ten. Right? If if somebody's who's gonna do a podcast, then obviously, they're gonna talk to the person they're interviewing. It's just sort of if if it's like, oh, you you you guys have something in common. It it's not really part of my job. It's just sort of something that you know, i if there's two people who have something in common, I'll introduce them. It's more common that I would run you know, an event on on biotech we'd have the alumni come and then any alumni who are, you know, the alumni who would be speaking, are currently working in biotech, the alumni who are attending are in undergrad wanting to work in Biotech. So that... That's more common. We're organizing the illinois podcast. Right? But it's more of my work is in setting up a event. Synchronous. Like, like a illinois panel or asynchronous, like I middle my podcast.

Host 1: Okay. That that is helpful. So just, you know, some many things engagement obviously top of line for you connecting them very curated based on topics, knowledge sharing, Just making sure the stays connected and and basically sees value versus maybe a university network. So you all can stay in touch with them. What what would be like the end goal? Why do you want them to stay within the pioneer academics network. After let's say they've graduated, you do you know, because you want them to connect with current students and new students once they've graduated of the program, Is that kind of the basic Correct.

Amy Winehouse: If this saves that's really the the the main goal. It's it kind of a a pipeline. Right? The the oldest alumni benefit the slightly younger alumni who benefits slightly along the younger alumni who benefit the current students. Right. So it's it sort of create this you know, and then they can all benefit each other. Right? That's that at this stage that that... There's not really an additional you know, in terms of our current thinking, that having more connect and building a stronger community where yeah. The value is really from each younger group of alumni becoming a bit older and then becoming illinois.

Host 1: Yeah. Makes makes lot a sense. Well, anything in particular when I reached out see that kind of picture interest about orbit or anything you already know about Or I'd love to maybe show the platform in and have take a look at this, but anything top of mind in terms of the tool that you know so far.

Amy Winehouse: Sure. So I... One of the things that I do with the alumni have an alumni advisory board, Right? So so that's the one alumni who are are interested in staying involved with Pioneer, and we have regular meaning and and something that they have suggested is because we we have this kind of problem of... We we have an alumni three, which is essentially a a Google spreadsheet and it's it's kind of clunky and not that helpful. We have an alumni linkedin group. That's fine, but it's not that active. And so thinking about how to make that aspect more active. Right?

Amy Winehouse: Is is a big question. They have suggested did, like, discord channel or or Slack channel? Right? And so that was... The the fact that that that orbit can connect to to to Slack with something that was that was interesting to me. Because that would be something, you know, what I would worry about is we would set up the black channels and and and then, you know, put a bunch of time and getting to people getting people on it, pay for black and and then nobody uses it right? And I'm not just not.

Host 1: It's it's... Okay. And so we will get the lot lot of our clients that are using Orbit. We're tool not a platform for users They're also using Slack, a lot of our customers use discord or another management. Platform. And, yeah, Slack just came out with a pretty big study where you know, declined... Like, the activity goes down over time and the increase rates based on users. So a lot of our customers are moving away from Slack because of that reason. But it's still a good place for you to connect as like a forum, and maybe that's a good thing for you and and cost if way we're a tool to kind of engage. So, yeah. Interesting that that's something you're considering, I wouldn't not recommend that. It's just one thing to use with maybe a tool like Orbit. So good to know you're you're kind of looking more of a platform to manage all these alumni since Linkedin is not super active for you all.

Amy Winehouse: Right. Right. Because, essentially, you know, what my direct responsibility is more at least now is kind of organizing podcast running the alumni advisory board organizing the event, like that kind of the tangible stuff that I do. You know, when you ask, like how many alumni you connect a month. You know, that... That's a very kind of casual thing. And that's not something that is even really officially part of my job description. And and that's not something that really could ever be higher than five without some type of tech support.

Amy Winehouse: Right? Like, it would have to be you know, the the the Google spreadsheet, the idea was that the students would reach out to each other. Right? But the problem is they don't support strike, because there's nothing that's, like, n them to do that.

Host 1: Right. So you would you would like it to be more than five, obviously.

Amy Winehouse: Right. Yeah. I mean, that would be great. I think if it that would really that that would mean that more people would listen to the podcast that would mean more people would come to the event. That would mean more people would volunteer as, you know, alumni panel with that event. Right? Because it's just, you know, when you meet somebody because of pioneer, that increases the value of pioneer in your mind. Right? Like, oh, yeah. Like, I'm met a cool person, they really helped me out. That's really great. I met them because of pioneer.

Host 1: Hundred percent. Okay. Great. I I'd love to show you the products, at least from like, let's say student perspective and see what day go through, and then there's a whole another admin.

Host 1: I just wanna be mindful of time. We have like minutes left. If I don't get through all of it, have to kinda of reconnect and and and continue, But give a one stop, in in ten minutes or you have, like an extra five in case we to go over...

Amy Winehouse: Extra five. To five yeah.

Amy Winehouse: I I don't I don't have anything else I need to do I just need to go to sleep.

Host 1: Okay. I'll I'll try to keep this in with with the time limit here just because...

Amy Winehouse: No fifteen minutes.

Host 1: Okay. So what I'll do then again, member perspective, I'll share what it looks like and, yeah, Really interested to get thoughts on this in terms of pioneer your academics. So can you see my screen right now the the blue overview?

Amy Winehouse: Yep.

Host 1: Okay. So I'll I'll keep it really high level for you. And I'll share this with you after sure after this call just so you have this review as a lot as good screenshots in there. But really high level. So orbit we're an Ai engine, and we do curated connections, one to one group connections as scale. Our big thing is reducing your time as a head of engagement or a community manager three big things that we do one we have matching criteria. So it's based on topics and interest in things that students and alumni say that they're they're strong or they wanna connected based on and that's a a pretty robust way for you to choose and curate these connections. The second thing is frictionless opt So there's no logins. We're not a platform to manage. There's no profiles we store If you're gonna use Slack or that's great. We're simply a tool to use to connect. We don't store these members on our platform.

Host 1: Okay. Everything is is as seamless as possible. Under the third thing is we do automated scheduling. So once they give us this information, and they opt into this next engagement, which could be multiple times per month once per month, whatever cadence that you wanna do to increase that engagement. Gonna send them introductions like, hey, here's your match. We're gonna send them a calendar invite and they just gotta click and go to a branded video platform that's branded pioneer your academics. It's not to certified, everything is encrypted. And, you know, just very seamless experience for those connections and you can track and monitor all this stuff. There's a lot of feedback, a lot of analytics on. Topics are discussing what topics they wanna discuss in the future a lot of good things that you have, again just to increase engagement over time.

Amy Winehouse: Mh. So if if i say that we we didn't view black. Right? Like this would just to be done through email or like, what... How...

Host 1: Okay. Okay. It could main is email. So one, we can send emails for you, you import all of your members into our tool and then we send up the emails and reminders. We get them to opt in. And... Or we can give you a dedicated link and you can post that on your slack. Or you can post it in your own or or Linkedin as well happen Okay.

Amy Winehouse: Interesting.

Host 1: So just a quick few stats for you. So we've done tens in tens of thousands of member connections through all a lot of our clients working a lot of different verticals. Vcs we started working with and we expanded it into enterprise. We're doing a lot of e learning at this point. So eighty seven is our N s, pretty high. We'd love to promote that. And then our average match is a four point three to five. And what that is after every match is completed mh.

Host 1: We give them a feedback form would would you rate this conversation or how strong was this match out of five? Four point three is the average. So really good conversations where having and most are saying they wanna continue matching an orbit a monthly basis. So just a lot of good feedback for you as a engagement or community manager. Couple companies that you may know that are clients atlas las working with, I think, one point one million of their developers in their community tech ladies, Vc platform and then maybe spend a spend is In an enterprise client, they have four thousand plus paid Cfo members for their Cfo Connect. So it is a paid membership and the connecting their current Numbers with members that they wanna onboard. So it maybe a similar use case for you all with your alumni students.

Host 1: Okay. So what that looks like from a member perspective, I'll just show you Cfo Connect and what this looks like from from their perspective. So the first thing that we do what you wanna connect, let's say, students and alumni or students to students they're gonna get a branded email invitation. So it's your colors, you're branding your logo. Everything is coming from you is not coming from orbit. How it works, we have a date of when you have to opt in by, and then you have a date away actually gonna get mashed up with let's say another alumni based on a specific topic. And there's a reminder email, they happen that first one. Very efficient, very clean very simple for the members or the students. The next thing that they do is once they click that opt form, they're taking to a a sign up form. Fifteen thirty seconds what are some areas of interest? What are topics you wanna discuss? Maybe course materials or maybe anything specific to this program that you have that you know is gonna make a connection can also connect them based on industry years of experience. We can also make sure it's only students with alumni or only students with students or a lot of we can split that up.

Host 1: And other custom criterion questions you can add in there. And then time zones, what are times you wanna connect? And then once that's completed, they get some confetti, and then we send them an email and this is something where we can also customize it in terms of what information that we send them but like, hey. Ellen and Jenny, here's an introduction to each other. Here's what you both doing or maybe how far long you are in this program? They're also gonna send them a a link directly in our calendar. So it's a quick first name a Linkedin address if you wanna ask them for that, and then their email. That's the only way we're gonna send them calendar invite. So once that comes up, They're gonna be taken to a branded video platform. So we're not too certified, couple of our Cs team members put this together. This is a part of the the frictionless experience for your members. Really great way it connects. We can monitor this. If you want to based on topics, anything else that they wanna discuss? Best way to get this type of feedback though is through our feedback form once it ends. So right after it happens did this conversation happen or did enough? Bit of a cadence for for shows.

Host 1: How strong was your match? What are topics you wanna discuss in the future? We can even ask him things like, how do you wanna be connected? Do you wanna be connected in group connections? We've events coming up. Do you like this event that we have. Do you wanna purchase participate?

Host 1: Session next time. Just a lot of good feedback for future engagements and then frequency. Do you want be matched up weekly or monthly or bi monthly? Just gives you a really good way to segment your your students your alumni. And connect them when they wanna be connected, and really went to increase engagement overall. So that's it. I'll I can share what it's, like from a an admin perspective, but any questions number part of it.

Amy Winehouse: No. I I'd I'd like to see from the admin perspective and I I have some questions just like detailed questions about forms, but I i I think I'd rather see the admin experience first and and then Yeah. Maybe maybe later, I can I cannot go.

Host 1: Definitely. Okay. So you have a workspace as let's say a a community admin, or a student admin. And so what you can do is you can manage all of your members really simple navigation here from the admin, the role the company or you can do a based on course or location, their social media, and you can create audiences. So if you wanted to import all five thousand of your alumni in here or all, you know, one thousand of your current students. And segment them and only connect your current students only connect your alumni if you have your distribution list, you just wanna connect all of them.

Host 1: In within that form, we can say we're only connecting current students with alumni and we'll do that automatically for field. So all this is here. When we create an engagement, this is the biggest thing to picking that matching criteria. So we're gonna set that opt date so we're gonna do opt until next week and then we're gonna do matching the following week. You just set those parameters here. Audience let's say, all everyone that's in the program that's at least active for this month. Then we're gonna create that topic. We're gonna create that invitation email. So a subject line, email body. It's all template out for you. You're branding your logo your colors already in here. And then that reminder email, same thing. You know, two days later, What does that look like? And then in that calendar invite, I'm not sure if you've seen that within this calendar invitation here. But you see this this conversation guide that you have you conversation guy.

Host 1: Discussion. We have a lot of templates you can choose and you can modify all of the stuff now into that that invite.

Amy Winehouse: Cool.

Host 1: In terms of that form, the opt form. So the first thing that they're gonna see is this little message that you have for them. We're gonna ask him very basic things about that's let's say. So, you know, can change up in company name, enroll to, you know, something else, but very basic employers, like the email we can toggle on their Linkedin your.

Host 1: Or off and that also goes into that calendar invitation so they can see...

Host 1: And then in terms of match questions where we connect based on areas of interest. This is all editable you can add up to seven questions here. And this could be yeah. Various topics based on the program or things that you think you know is gonna create a strong match for them. And then we can do years of experience. We can toggle this stuff on or off. We can even change the question from years of experience to...

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. Graduation year or...

Host 1: New year or something like that. Company size. This could be maybe for alumni. If they wanna put this in there if it's relevant.

Host 1: Yeah. Stage we can toggle this stuff off. And then you can add in custom questions. So we can add up like, quite a few custom questions that you wanna add in there, you know, this rate or, you know, area of expertise or location sometimes that's something that you can put in here, and you can change the logic of this so you can match for unlike can do weighted scoring. A lot of things that we can we can set up with you. You have a dedicated Cs member. We've been thirty days working with you and rang a first engagement so you have this to continue going forward. And we're with you. Every be step of the way.

Host 1: Last part of this is time zones, obviously, that's where the the timing comes in. We're gonna ask in their time zone and they're gonna choose a couple days that they wanna meet up. So it's very easy to that.

Host 1: Automated connection in scheduling. So in terms of feedback, very basic things was not it's fit for me. Some other feedback. They can give us some testimonials based on that and you can use that lot of good call feedback. Optional questions that I discussed previously or topics. So what are some future things you wanna to discuss in the next round, let's say, next month or next week.

Host 1: We can add in those types of connections so you can add in your panel events that you mentioned, your in person events or your virtual events or if you wanna do group connections, is this something that you're interested in? Just really quick feedback from all these students and alumni.

Host 1: And if i see weekly, monthly really easy to add this into to that form, and that's it. That's it in terms of your engagement setup.

Amy Winehouse: Cool Okay.

Amy Winehouse: What I'll do with interesting I'll just quickly for the dashboard.

Host 1: So a completed engagement you can have all the feedback from every single number. That left it here. And then your dashboard. So we can show you say you invite all thousand of your current members. Let's say you invite five thousand people with an engagement. We can show the rate can show you the total net promoter score of that entire engagement. The average match rating topics that they discussed, we can show you based on grade love or based on years of experience or whatever you wanna do to say who exactly is meeting up in this engagement. Time zone is another one that we track for you and then feedback questions topics. Frequency. Really simple really basic, but I think really impactful for, especially the student alumni connection.

Amy Winehouse: Right. If if we're thinking about let's say, a a junior University. Right? And and the junior and university could either be there's sort of three options for them. Right? They could have, like, a lateral call. Right? With somebody else who's also around a junior who's interested in the same thing as them. Right? So they're sharing advice about they both wanna do search biology. Right? So it's like a pure call. Right? That junior could also be a mentor for somebody younger. Right? They could be a men for somebody older. Right? And and there's going to always be some kind of bias towards wanting to be the men. Right? Like, people will want somebody older kind of give them advice to to some extent, I I guess so to what extent can we control that right? Like, if somebody is choosing, you know, yes, I wanna participate, but I only want somebody older than me. I'm open to talking to somebody younger, somebody the same age, somebody older.

Host 1: So there's a couple ways that we can do that. The one you can say excuse me. You can say, the audience. These are the mint t's in these are. These on mentors and really connect to place on the audience.

Amy Winehouse: Or... Okay.

Host 1: No. Oh sorry. In that form. You can say by grades Let's say junior, senior graduate, And you can say I only wanna connect Okay.

Host 1: People who are of a different grade level only gonna connect those people based on that criteria that you have. So you're never gonna connect to June to junior unless you say that. So there's ways that do that based on that form.

Amy Winehouse: Okay. Yeah. So I would just have to kind of think about it. I mean, I don't know what would happen. Right? Like, if we Yeah. But but that's that's that's interesting. Okay. Cool. What is the what is the price information?

Host 1: So right now, we do a flat fee. So we don't do it based on community size right now, we do annual contracts and we can even do, like, a paid trial if you're interested in testing this out for a couple months. But we have a flat fee of forty five k annually.

Amy Winehouse: Okay Is there some kind of... I don't know if you have, like, a like, a Pdf or something that I could you know, share with with my team and kind of have them take a look.

Host 1: Yep. Yep. What I can do is I'll send you a one pager.

Amy Winehouse: I'll send you this you have that as well even goes into this dashboard in the back end.

Host 1: Yeah. I can get that over to you. What would make sense as next step? Is this something where once I sure maybe you circulated with your team and you and I can touch base like, in a week or so to see Yeah. What this looks like in terms of timeline?

Amy Winehouse: Yeah. I mean, I I think, you know, from from previous experiences with kind of for us, this is this is a big contract. Right pioneer is not a giant company. Right? So it's not just sort of like, you know, we we're just gonna kind of, you know, sign up and and and end go for because this is a lot of money. You know, we we have very expensive software that that we use that we pay a lot of money for, but it's a long process us. To kind of really think about, you know, is this really the priority? When is it gonna be priority. Right? So i I think that, you know, I don't I don't anticipate that this would sort of something where, you know, next week, I'd be making a decision. Right? Like, I I think it's and this this is gonna be a a a bigger kind of topic that I have to kind think strategically about this kind of considering other priorities, but I I think that it's something that I will take very seriously and I I think you my team will take seriously. Too. It's just that, you know, as of, as a smaller business, it's not quite, you know, like a a giant, you know, Cfo sort of group where they can just kind of throw that kind of money together easily So I I I think that, you know, if you can send me a one pager, I'd love to go over it with with with people, I think probably probably checking in in twenty three is probably what realistically makes sense.

Amy Winehouse: Like, let me, you know show it to people kind of get their feedback. I'd love to... I have some meetings with the the I have two alumni advisory board meetings and so there's a younger one and the older one. I have the older one. Coming up next. And so I'd love to talk to them about their reaction to this. Like, would they be be interested in know kind of signing for this knowing that they would be more of the the mentors. So I I think probably sometime in January would make sense to.

Host 1: Yeah. Makes some sense. Of course. Just let you let me know how the best way to get this with your team and then saying, yeah, I've trying to like, obviously, you see some value here with Orbit two.

Host 1: Looks like something I would tell work with you guys what we could also do is, I know forty five k's is like a a long term annual contract, if you guys did, like, a two year, we could also reduce that.

Host 1: We could do a paid trial, we can go down to, like, maybe as low as like five k paid trial. I I don't in here... I just wanna share some information you when you have those shots with the team wanna make it Yes.

Host 1: It's possible for you to get in try the tool if you all think it's value, let's discuss what that could look like on an annual basis.

Amy Winehouse: Right. Right. Yeah. I I think some kind of pain trial might be. Might be really helpful. I mean forty five k. Is is is a lot for us and and I think that it's but I do see that it would be very valuable. I I think having a five k or whatever it is. Like, some some sort of, you know, that that sort of size trial is nice even... I mean, just because it it is... We need to kind of see if it works right? And and and so, you know, how interested people are when we actually get it kinda going Yep.

Host 1: Definitely happy to work with you on that in anyway possible. But I'll send this up over you would take a look at cool.

Host 1: I'll follow I'll just touch base maybe mid December, but I'll definitely slice something for maybe conversation more in dub in January.

Host 1: Yeah.

Amy Winehouse: That sounds good. And are there... Like, what would the... So so it's forty five k kind of regardless of of are there any limitations. Right? Like, I I don't I don't anticipate here. This is not a giant community. It's not like there's gonna be, you know, meetings all the time, but... You know, it it can only be a certain number of engagements per year, a certain number of people per per year.

Host 1: We can do up to ten engagements per month, which I say was probably not i said you can have unlimited criteria. We have some integrations that we could do if you're managing it from another platform. Kind be all of this stuff, but really the only limitation is the number of engagements per per month.

Amy Winehouse: Okay. And it's it's ten. So that would be like, and and that means That means like, there could be many people participating in that engagement.

Host 1: Yes, and we can we can't even go over. That number. Like, you're probably like with an el learning platform and they wanna do sixteen engagements per month with various groups some of them are going to one connections as or our group connections kind of all going one time. Or we could just do a couple for the whole group every single but it just depends on how you wanna engage people.

Amy Winehouse: Right. Okay. And so for those ten engagements, I mean, one engagement could have five thousand people the participating?

Host 1: Yeah. Potentially. I mean, you're gonna invite.

Amy Winehouse: It wouldn't be. But for for us that way it would not. I'm just sort of hypothetically. Like, if if five thousand people all said, yes. I wanna do it and those matches were made and we have no limit on the number.

Host 1: We used to have like a limit on ten thousand, but now they're we'll working with, like, less. You you can go to, like, millions we can handle that. This.

Amy Winehouse: Interesting. Okay. Cool. Yeah. That's great.

Host 1: Okay. I also think a case study, you know, I think that's relevant to you again, I'll just prep you with as much that you have to look at to evaluate with the tool. And then we'll take it from there.

Amy Winehouse: Okay. That sounds great. Thank you.

Host 1: Meet Amanda?

Amy Winehouse: Thanks.

Host 1: Okay. Talk soon.

Amy Winehouse: Bye. Yep. Right. Thank you.
