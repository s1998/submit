Client 2: Wow.

Client 2: Amazing. That's great to know.

Host 1: Yeah.

Client 2: Yeah. Very good.

Host 1: Well, really good to connect again on this stuff. I don't know how much you have had a chance to review anything that we sent to about Orbit, but we're super excited about the potential and yeah, I guess, you know, what are your thoughts after...

Client 2: No. I have I have a few questions that I want to go through. About using the system. So so a few questions between, I think it's essential and the pro is the pro the second to?

Host 1: Froze the second tier.

Client 2: Yep. So between the essential and the pro, and then a few things we'd like the match up. I just wanna get my head around it and really understand how how this works. So with the essential, do we get meetings with you? Like, if we wanna go over anything or is that only with the pro?

Host 1: You get it with the essential as well. We do put in there of these quarterly customer success strategy, sessions, your you're we do some in we become Qb r's over here. So you're gonna get quarterly analytics and stuff out the way, but, yeah, you you you get us every single month.

Client 2: Okay. So, like, if there's an issue or something, is it easy to contact somebody, like, she get some help you you have our Cs team and our onboarding team with you whenever.

Host 1: Like, we're very responsive. And, like, I'm all be involved as well and Be. So anytime you need something You can let us know as all but... Your Rcs team is very good.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. Perfect.

Client 2: Yeah. Now more specific questions. So, like, the video plan for that that is used. Is that your plan for or is it you use somebody else's platform? It's not on zoom or something. Is it or how does it work?

Host 1: We we kind build this in house. We do source from, like, a video provider, that's like a third party, but it's it's loves us to customize it. It's not Zoom. It's not Google Hangouts. And the reason that we did that is because you know, it's a bit more customized to... Let's say, you and Christian christina Lopez as a brand.

Host 1: And encrypted. So there's a lot more flexible that we have with it.

Client 2: If you okay.

Host 1: If you're... I guess, your members are wanting to use the Zoom, They can always switch that out.

Client 2: So what they would like exchange contact with somebody and then they'll start talking to them in Zoom. Is that what you mean?

Host 1: So we're gonna... We're gonna default to our our platform so I can just click and calendar button and go to ours. But if they say, hey, I wanna record this for like, my Zoom for whatever reason, it's not You can just replace it in calendar invite.

Client 2: Okay. So that was my next question is about recording. So it is possible even on your platform to record.

Host 1: Yes.

Client 2: So I'm thinking that I I don't know if it's possible to disable that because as these you know, this is quite... I you... As I say in the last meeting, a lot of the thing... It's not really busy it's more like going through. It's almost like having a therapy session i'd say. So we wouldn't want to record that.

Host 1: We don't have to record. I would say would say a large majority of our members and clients don't record it. It's just a feature that you can turn on if you want to.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. But it wouldn't be possible to, like, have that design deactivated or is it the recording Yeah.

Client 2: The option to record.

Host 1: Yep. We can we can default it as deactivated.

Client 2: So it won't be okay. Okay. That's a good... Because I'm just thinking, like, I'm just trying to I'm very much thinking about the rest. So it's, like, trying to minimize everything low thing any complaints we they have. So that no one's gonna say. Oh, I spoke to somebody and they recorded session. You know, I'm just imagining, like the worst things that could happen that's how my mind works. But, like, I want the perfect product I'm sorry thinking about anything bad. I could have Yeah.

Host 1: We can comfortable with that. We can default it to off. So that shouldn't be But if any case you wanna turn it back on, of course, that's that's always an option.

Host 1: We we have a lot of control over what happens in within that video session Okay.

Client 2: Perfect. Oh, another thing. So Do we decide the number of matches? They can have a month or do when they opt in. Do they have a choice like they want have one month for two a months we'll start with the very first engagement.

Host 1: Let's say it takes us a a couple weeks to one set up and then have everyone opt in and then match them, and then they're gonna tell us So it... It's a bit of both. If you can have... You can have multiple matching matching rounds per month or you can do once per month no matter what? Then once you get feedback from people, and they say, hey, You... Maybe a large majority say, I only wanna meet up once a month or a large majority to say, I do wanna meet up multiple times, then we can set those engagements up according to that feedback So it's not standard.

Client 2: It's not like we decide that we'll only have too much up the month per person and then that's it. They could choose like, so they can also have an should saying I want four match up the month. I'm just trying to understand, like, in the process, So we just define, like, we want everyone to have two match up the month.

Client 2: Or do they personally get to decide how many match up day want I'm just trying to figure it out I would say the best thing...

Host 1: What we would recommend or what I would recommend is you wanna set up two engagements per month, let's say one to two and give per month. Have that as a standard and they can decide to opt in or not opt. So they don't have to opt in if they don't want you for a second engagement, and then as you run maybe, you know, to... three foreign engagements and you're getting a lot of feedback saying, hey, I wanna meet up more often a, I wanna meet up less often, then you can then you can spread out the engagements or if a lot of people let's say segment wants to meet up twice per month more or something or one more? Segment them and create a different engagement for people that wanna be more active and then run other engagement alongside of it with people that only want monthly matches.

Client 2: So it.

Host 1: Then we can tailor it based on what segments are looking for.

Client 2: Alright. So because I'm just trying to understand. So how do we know if them interested in more? Is it that final report that they fill out, like feedback it's the feedback form.

Client 2: So in the feedback form, there will be a question saying I want more I want less sessions.

Host 1: Yes. Exactly. So Let me see if I can show you that. Did did... I... Yeah. I think I showed you last time, Yes.

Client 2: Look you did So in the feedback, this is your dashboard that you get for every single engagement.

Host 1: And then you can see of topics and then over here, how frequently would you like to be mad up. So after every single one, a large majority want monthly. Right? But for maybe fifteen percent, you wanna go every other week. You can put them in a segment and mash them up every single week weekend So after we start this, then they...

Client 2: So then we can change That's what you mean. So it's like we could start with one once a month And then once they've had one of these, match ups, they answer the report, and then they're, like, actually i want this every week. And then we could change, so put that into the every week group.

Host 1: Yes. Definitely. So in your audience Would be a good place that you can do that. So you're gonna have a main distribution list with everybody. And let's say you keep a standard your engagements for the whole list, but then you're gonna have maybe a new audience that you create these are for people that wanted meet to... weekly or bi, and you can create a separate engagement for those that wanna be more engage alongside this main distribution list.

Client 2: Okay. So do I set this up or just somebody in your team? Set it up for me.

Host 1: You're gonna you'll have pretty intense thirty day onboarding. So we're gonna this up with you, we do a lot of the hand holding the heavy lifting, you know, we want you to get in there and be able to to run this and drive this however much up, but we're always gonna be there to help you out with it.

Client 2: Okay. Because I'm just I'm just imagining like, that having to get all of these things done. So you would help out with that with them...

Client 2: And if it was, like, three months later. After we've done the onboarding.

Host 1: We're with you every time. So if you... Every single month if you some help with your engagements, were in there with you.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: One other thing. So So the un onboarding would be when would it be? December, January.

Host 1: I would say are you all wanting to run, like, an engagement in December as a prep like, hey, let's set some new for solutions or like, let's... Let's you have a message before the New year. Is that something that you would wanna.

Client 2: So I'm actually thinking, because we had said that this unit the community that we have now they would test this out. But they... They're not... So what changing... So we we're still deciding how is gonna work, starting in February with the the the new community that we're developing for this the heart Force. And people... So people who have down the heart out and me can opt in today. But they don't have to necessarily. So it's an option and that's only gonna be decided in February. But they will be... It would be good to try this out So you'd said, like, to text it, maybe in January with these people, but they won't then continue with it. So I'm trying to think how that would... How we could do No.

Client 2: Because they community... So it's almost like, but community that was that you can use this way haven't been billed. Yet. It's like I community it exist, but we have a try out community see then they can opt into to this if they want in February. So I don't know... Because that's the thing. So like, if we now it if we now signed the contract and everything starting first of December. I'm just trying to wrap my head around when we would actually start the onboarding considering that this product is only really our project in which we'd be using this we will only really start in February.

Host 1: Yeah. Yeah. So one we can be flexible on and who he want. We wanna maximize the impact for the community that you wanna test this out with for that first engagement. So just to confirm you no engagements, no testing out in December or do you want to run the test engagement December.

Client 2: I know. I had I'm feeling into that and I just So I think January will be the best.

Client 2: Because we've got lots of other things going on at the same time, and I just think it's gonna be... I wanna be able to, like, focus on this to see how things are working out, and I don't think it will won't have enough time to to actually, you know, give the enough energy to it Let's do this.

Host 1: Let's do the onboarding in January. So it's the best... It's best to run is do the onboarding once you run your engagement. So we're gonna set up this first engagement, and get everything in that you need and then actually run it off and look at how people are responding and the feedback and then set up future engagement. So I think January is the best time to run that we can we can just agree to a a contract start date. Let's say in January.

Client 2: Okay. But so what would happen then with the fee? Because it... Like, the initial fee or something had been waving I don't know if it was dying till the end of November.

Client 2: Would that be okay if we start in January?

Host 1: We can start in January. I mean, if you all we could lock in all of the stuff that we need to. If you all just wanted to, like, sign a contract here in November, let's say, and then we'll just slate the onboarding for January in your contract. So basically skipped December and you'll start a year from January.

Client 2: Okay. Okay. That would be... That would be perfect. That would be really good.

Host 1: Okay in it or it sounds like you're leaning more towards the essentials tier?

Client 2: No. I don't know yet. I haven't got those questions. I have a list Okay.

Client 2: Okay. So another thing that I wanted to ask is So this is a course. Right? So this the heart out me is the course it that is divided into modules. And I'm trying to think if it would be possible to define topics for these chats, that's related to one of the modules. And So instead of the past and finding out, that's what they're gonna talk about when they get to the because I saw that the emails that then you said, so people will receive after they booked to and everything, that was receive email saying, oh, this is the the topic of the chat. I actually wanted to to know if it would be possible for the person to pick like, I want to talk to somebody about this topic Yes.

Host 1: Absolutely. That's like one of the main things that we wanna do here. So what that looks like is When they click on that email, write, the invitation email that you send over or if you post this link for someone to opt into. They're gonna be taken to a form. In this form takes thirty seconds. So this kind of your branding your colors, your logo. Here's a quick message that we can modify. It's telling them, hey, this is what we're doing. Well this would be switched with, like, A course you know, connection so it's gonna ask them their name. I'm just gonna... Once they fill this in for every future engagement, it's gonna pre fill. So I fill this one out yet okay.

Host 1: So I'll I'll just show what that looks like. So that's there. We can, yeah. Current role company name.

Client 2: This would be completely to go back. Go back I just wanna have a look at this.

Client 2: So we could change this or this doesn't even have to come up. We couldn't, like, have this slide like, doesn't even exist because we won't be asking these people they this.

Host 1: Yep. We can toggle off roll and work we can toggle that What we do need to ask him is this first initial and name and email, so we can send my right. But after that, we can toggle this off you ask that, And the years of experience, obviously, this was tailored to finance for this particular group, but we can modify that and we can even turn this question off as well.

Client 2: No. This one... You remember the last meeting I said that it would be good to ask them like, how long have you been going through with search awakening or how long have you been interested in these topics?

Client 2: That would be a really that be a very good question so that then we can actually match people with more less same amount as years.

Client 2: So it's not somebody who's, like just started is really a newbie b with somebody who's really advanced. So that question will be good.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: What that what that question is they whatever they choose. We can we can connect them based on the same or we can ensure that there's different. Right? So if someone shows three three to five is someone did ten, you could set it so only those people connect.

Client 2: Okay. Alright.

Host 1: And so... Yeah. Okay. Number of employees, obviously, we can modify this or take this...

Client 2: We could... So these questions let me just understand. So these questions are for any of the tiers. Essential and pro every tier.

Client 2: Okay. So they go through all of these questions. I I can change, like, the title, like, what what the questions are. Is that possible?

Host 1: Yes. Yes. Definitely. So this... Yeah. Exactly. You can you can say, I only want them to choose one topic or multiple topics and but you can modify all this stuff. And this is what it looks like from their perspective. And it's gonna ask him time zones. You know, what time are we and then a couple times to actually meet up? And then we're that directly into their calendar Okay. So one last question we ask him is do you wanna be matched up twice? So if does an odd number the opt in?

Client 2: One that's a good question.

Host 1: We do twice.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Okay. That's it. They get some Confetti and that is the total sign up.

Client 2: Okay. So then now how do we when we get to the what you call it here? The matching rules or the questions.

Client 2: Yep so this is his back. So this is standard for all the kids.

Host 1: Yes. So here's what standard is that invitation email? And reminder and then so here's the sign up form where you're gonna edit that sign up form. Is that that first description.

Host 1: Okay. The member information. So we can turn off that rolling.

Host 1: The linkedin we can turn that stuff off, and it's gonna go right into the match question. So This is where we modify the the interest and we can wait these way that we want we can do it, you know, choose three or choose one. And then years of experience, we modify that question.

Host 1: Okay. We've already have these company size ones turned off here But these are all standard on any tier. When we get into like, the approach here, This is where we can start adding additional custom questions and you can do a bit more have more flexibility around your matching rounds per month and you can do either one to one or group matching pro obviously. So this is what we start to get into the probe.

Host 1: And these custom questions But so...

Client 2: But the the essential has one custom question.

Host 1: Yes.

Client 2: So one of these custom questions for essential and then the pro has, like, four or five? Is that it? For. Okay. So let me just have a look at the custom question.

Host 1: Okay.

Client 2: I'm thinking. So with people... So we have how many modules, I think it's eight. Eight modules. Because I am thinking like, if somebody actually wanted to talk to... We could somebody wanted to talk to somebody about module one. And be connected with somebody who wants the same thing. How could we do that?

Host 1: Go specifically around the module.

Client 2: Yeah.

Host 1: Would does each module have a different topic Okay. So we might not need to add a custom question for that one. If we go back here to the match questions. And then we modify these topics, and we align them with modules. Maybe this is a good way do this maybe we need something a bit more in doubt, but we can modify these options and if they choose just say learning development is one of them for for this. And you know that aligns with module one, looking to chat about that particular topic through module one.

Client 2: But I just consent. So this is the thing. So, like, it takes it takes some time. I say that it takes around three months to do all whole course. If you're gonna do it properly, it'll take you about three months.

Client 2: Okay. And so if somebody we've just started today, because then people will be able to come in whatever. So imagine I started the call four months ago, and I just be matched up with somebody who died a week ago, and they've only done module one But we've all... We both decided we want also talk about module five. Then I matched up with somebody who hasn't actually done it. Do you wanna say what I mean?

Host 1: Yes. Definitely. So if you wanna match someone of, like, with the module, maybe they're are currently on maybe or you want mention them was module ahead of them.

Client 2: No. Not ahead of them. Never ahead of them because they wouldn't really know how talk about it.

Client 2: We could thinking how that could... How that would work or if that's gonna be two details I think I think that's that's the fun question to add in there.

Host 1: I mean, we can change this wording up, but you could do something like which module are you currently on or you're you're currently in. And if they choose I'm module one, know you're gonna match someone up with the same module based on...

Client 2: Oh, so we could have we put in like like, Let's say module one.

Host 1: And then description if you want to Or however you wanna do that?

Host 1: Okay. Well, goes in there into that custom question So they're either they're... They're gonna tell you the module that they're currently. So you can look at... So in the dashboard, you could say, wow, I have twenty percent of people that opted in who are on module one.

Client 2: But so these then these questions. So how many times would people these questions because obviously, it would be always changing.

Host 1: Yep. They're they're gonna answer these questions every engagement. They're gonna opt in if you run two engagements per month, they're gonna answer this fifteen second questionnaire. They're gonna be matched up based on those answers. The next engagement, let's say in two weeks, they're gonna be pre filled from their last my No I'm.

Host 1: You're gonna match up with someone this next week with someone okay?

Client 2: Because I thought that this was bad if they would answer these questions and then that would be the basis to decide like, for all of the match up throughout all the month. So, basically, You say... So let me think as if I was a client. So I'm saying I wanna opt into two two or one a month. And then I answer to this question. And then after that, I give feedback. And then I'll get another email and I don't know how long saying. You wanna be matched up again.

Client 2: Yep. And then I answered these questions again.

Host 1: Exactly. You have every new engagement you're getting updated information on new topic, he does the module they're in and they're gonna give you available times because that's gonna change from let's say, last week or two weeks ago, we're gonna match them up every single time based on them. So you're they're updating their information as you go.

Client 2: Okay. Alright. Yeah. That's... That's really cool. I didn't know. I didn't understand that that's power it was like, they would get these new questions at single time. That's good. That's really good because we could actually work around that with these this module.

Host 1: Mh.

Client 2: With the modules to match people up going through the same the same module. That's cool.

Host 1: And you can you can manage all this in your engagement dashboard. So you can say here's one in August. Here's one in July, or you can do two number one in August, number two in August, and you can duplicate that and just modify it going forward it or you don't to duplicate You don't have to modify anything just duplicate the engagement and then...

Client 2: Yeah. Because it would be because you have eight modules to pick from. And so basically, the person's just gonna pick the modules they're in, and then they'll be match up somebody who's in the same module.

Host 1: Yep. Yep. So the engagement foundation is the same. What they're answering is different and how we match them up every weeks rv engagement is gonna change.

Client 2: Is this exactly. Okay. Alright. So then so going back now to the essentials, so the essential which have one of these questions only, and then the pro week would have four different types of these question Yes.

Client 2: Okay. I'm gonna have to... So I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to brainstorm a bit on this because I am now. And now that I've understood exactly. Because the process that's why that how what sort of questions we would be using or if we could just off with having one of the questions with the modules only. I'm thinking about that.

Host 1: Which other questions would you wanna add in there?

Client 2: Yeah. That's what I'm I'm saying. I'm not sure.

Client 2: Another quick... Another thing. So would these questions be able to be changed depending on which group they're going to. So, like, is it the same? So would we have the standard question? This is this... Imagine it's the module question. So we'd have this standard question. And that's gonna be the same one until we change it again. That'll be what's going out to everyone. Or could we have a different question for example, if we have the group that wants to meet twice a week to twice some month and the group that wants me once a month. Could it be different questions or it's the same question?

Host 1: It can be both. So what you can do is so for every new engagement you can duplicate the old one, and then you can ask them the same questions for that next segment or that next engagement, because every new audience requires a new engagement, and you can modify that. So it can change for every subgroup that you wanna send this to.

Host 1: Okay. Keep it the same. There's a lot of flexibility in in asking different criteria.

Client 2: Okay. Because I'm thinking, so if people, for example, once do it twice a month. One of the questions, one of the times could be about a module and the second time could be it's about anything they want. Like, not having to pertain to a module, but, like, just something they're going through.

Host 1: Yeah. You can even take the module question out for the next round or for a specific segment while the... Oh while the module question is running with the main group, You have a different one at the same time without that question or different question.

Client 2: Okay. But then that would have to be applied to the group. Like there's the main group and then there's are like a subgroup.

Host 1: What do mean to apply to the same group?

Client 2: So like, The the main question would go to the main group, And then the second question or whatever, not second, but another option question would go to a sub. They wouldn't receive that main question.

Host 1: if as long as they were in two separate engagements, Okay.

Host 1: So if you were gonna run engagement with the whole group, they would all have to have the same questions to opt into.

Client 2: You mean the engagement as in a group because I'm it's... The out... This is only gonna be one on one engagement.

Host 1: Yeah. That... That's fine the one on one what they let's say the entire you know, every every member.

Client 2: Every if you send this and give it to everyone, they'll have to have the same questions.

Host 1: Reflection for, like, a subgroup of of everyone, that subgroup has to have a different engagement completely with a different form.

Client 2: Okay.

Host 1: But it will still update that information at a member level. So Yeah. If they if they filled out a a form or a an opt in form for an engagement that wasn't part of the main distribution. That information. Let's say this I'm unknown module two. That's gonna be updated on their members. When you send out the next one, way, they're gonna opt in every time. So they're gonna update.

Client 2: Alright.

Client 2: Does that your Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think it did. No it's good because then we can like play around with the question. So just just to understand this, So we would have to create. So imagine you've got the name the main group with everybody in it. So to make a subgroup, you'd have to remove people from the main group. Put them into a subgroup group so they would not be in this big group anymore. They'd been, like an a separate group.

Host 1: If you wanted to ask him a different question Yes. You could you probably wouldn't wanna run. You probably wouldn't wanna have them in two different engagements at the same time. That's why I'd wanna separate at different times.

Client 2: When you say engagement you're talking about the group.

Host 1: I'm talking about a match making rounds.

Client 2: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Because I I'm thinking in group and your We're figure out the same thing but using different what. Okay.

Host 1: Okay. You're not referring to group matching. You're referring to the group of people that you wanna match.

Client 2: Yes.

Host 1: One.

Client 2: Okay. Yep. Yeah Yeah Okay. Alright. What else did I want to ask? No. I think that's it. I think these are more my more of my Okay.

Client 2: So let me think. So if you could send, I know you sent the contract and agreement for the pro. If you could send one for the essential, And I'm gonna have a chat with Christina about this. Just a brainstorm a bit on the questions. One more thing. So if we imagine that we start with essential, And then halfway through the year, we decide at actually, we want more questions you wanna go to Pro. How would that work?

Host 1: Yeah. So typically, we will just have that that chat with the person you're either their onboarding manager or myself for Bi or whoever working with on a cs level, who's helping set these engagements. And then typically you just upgrade to a pro, let's say, halfway through the year.

Client 2: So we just pay the extra you just adds in Yeah.

Host 1: You would just upgrade midway through the year to a pro. Let's say, Okay.
