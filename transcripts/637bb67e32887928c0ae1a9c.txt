Client 1: Hey ben. Hello. How are you guys doing?

Client 1: Alright. appreciate guys taking a few minutes out your Monday hop on phone here.

Client 2: Not a problem. I just need to see what you got.

Client 1: You in contact with with Kevin over here i work closely with and under curious you know, beyond Kevin obviously reaching out to you and persistence on his end and, you know, frankly him being good up what he does. Was there anything specific what we said that let you take today's call?

Client 2: Know what, Jericho, we have been Looking to sort of have a more data driven a approach to this whole braun us for a little bit here and we've kind made some progress from the Crm standpoint. So really just sort of right time right place from Kevin Standpoint got a few of your competitors that were in the process of evaluating and Kevin Called and said, you know what? Long as we're doing an evaluation remains may as well evaluate everybody here. Just sort the right time right place. Awesome And I think I saw...

Client 1: In the notes you guys are on dynamics.

Client 2: We are.

Client 1: You said you're already talks with a you a few other vendors?

Client 2: Yes.

Client 1: And what kind of data are you looking to get from these vendors?

Client 2: You know, Jody, you can probably talk a little bit from But really, you know, what we're looking to do is you know, we've been pretty niche for a long time, pretty focus on our industry.

Client 2: We think that there's still some data that we can collect in our industry in terms of you know, kind what the population of kind of marketable opportunities that each dealership is who's sitting in what seat? How do we get contact with them if we want to. And then, you know, just kinda using this to help us figure out, you know, okay for entities that look like this, you know, what's the population look like kind of of the demographics of those groups, kind of that pretty standard stuff in terms of market expansion of understanding the who are aware of what those opportunities look like. Gotcha.

Client 1: Okay. Awesome.

Client 2: Joey, feel free to chime in here if I miss anything.

Client 3: No. That that's pretty much, you know, it in a nutshell. And then also by filling in some some information gaps like revenue or number of locations or something like that that will help us further define our ideal customers Mh so that we can spend more time going after you know, people that fall into that bucket rather than somebody that's doesn't it match that?

Client 1: How many records do you have in dynamics right now?

Client 3: Well, I'm not sure how many we have in dynamics, but in March ke, we have about fourteen hundred prospects. So this industry is not I mean, there's not going to be like, thousands or a hundred thousand contacts. I mean, there's only you know, a handful of of truck dealerships which are our primary customer and then, you know, our ancillary markets like the best or the trailer. You know, i I wouldn't expect them to have you know, more a lot more dealerships or contacts than the truck industry. So it's not you know, our our contact should our contact count certainly be... I don't sync even top thirty thousand and that's probably, you know, very generous estimate understood.

Client 1: And then Is it safe to say that that youtube two would be the the final decision maker on And what data minute you go is?

Client 3: I would be a strong influencer.

Client 3: But that it would definitely have the final.

Client 2: Jericho, I I think this one... Mean, yeah, obviously it kinda depends on some numbers stuff if we need to go ask for budget for somebody else, but but this all between Jodi and I will we'll make it I'll probably pull the trigger base done on Joey's good judgment. Okay.

Client 1: And it sounds like you guys are are looking to, you know, something if it's on sooner rather than later.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. We have
