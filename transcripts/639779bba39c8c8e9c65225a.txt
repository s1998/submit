Host 1: Hello?

Client 2: Everyone Shawn How's.

Client 2: There was dumping. It snowed from, like, Friday, like, afternoon, and it didn't stop. Like literally. Till lap. It was crazy. I think like, or feet or something. Probably weekend. It's not Oh, I got.

Client 2: Yeah. Exactly Let's go that.

Client 3: Something while I didn't able snows too because you see, like, I don't know. You see that it's like a city that has to, like snow or, like, shuttle style of the way. And like, you realize it's like, it's not just like a out in time when it sunny yeah. It's like, this is a real place with a real winner and, like I don't know. A different perspective.

Client 2: What time of?

Client 2: It's a wild operation. After that's so much. Just like So, like, move all this stuff around.

Client 2: I like they happy be make sure.

Client 3: And it's like relatively typical that people get like, you know, stranded or stuck on the highway. It's just, you know, part of the season. Gotta go get Yeah.

Client 3: Like, this fruit might be shut down.

Client 3: So It might think you twelve hours to get home. It's like some impressive feet.

Client 3: Yeah. I mean, meanwhile the gutter are flooded in Tv, and everyone's like, freaking out.

Client 2: Yeah. Dude I drove back here if for My it raining so, like, four crashes on the side of the road.

Client 3: Yeah. You on see him in way out in the Mountains. What you see in with.

Client 2: Valley. Yep.

Client 3: Cool around jumping in from a call and then we'll get rolling. About? A nice audio in the office?

Client 4: Yeah.

Client 3: Oh, nice do. Catch you in this yeah I'm going in. Pretty sure tomorrow through Thursday. So I'll see you nice.

Client 4: Yeah. I'm here till Wednesday.

Host 1: They fix the Internet?

Client 3: Oh, nice.

Client 4: So far so good.

Client 3: Depends on where you say, yeah. They're working on the extenders for the sales side. Any other highlights from the week weekend anyone do anything cool?

Client 4: Hand claus.

Client 3: Oh, wow in the flesh.

Client 4: Feel Really good. I I'm really good Santa claus It's actually it's pretty impressed It's always...

Client 3: Yeah. When you say the going on down have, like, the actual beard that they probably grew this keep you and, like, they're really dedicated the correct.

Client 3: Yeah. Pretty like the...

Client 4: Yeah. The whole it it You had the wax going, you know, and my kinda Nice. Joint picture. Love it.

Client 3: Cool. Well, looks like we got Rabindranath now, So we'll go and get rolling here guys. We got a ton to cover. And I do want to try to get everyone handful of momentum between now and the pipeline update meeting just since I to our straight we're bumping in the territory for meeting length there. So we'll try to give everyone a few minutes between sessions to to reset. We do a lot to jump into. So We'll dive into the discovery deck and discovery training here. So Thank you all for taking a look at the video. Prior to coming into the training, Hope it was helpful as far as laying the groundwork still go into to enter, But thank you again for getting be a little bit more quickly here because it would be pretty dense to just start from scratch How just rolled out in this session. So Jump enough. And again, forgive me some of this is repeat, but I didn't wanna just reinforce why the new deck. Know the first is that we need get a compelling way to explain Those to prospects. You know, if you close your eyes and we'd explain those egg to you. And just the kind of blatant term it might sound like every other Fp and tool out there. So we need ways to differentiate that message for us to stand out and without standardization, hard to measure results, you know, for all kinda own message it's hard to know really, what is that, you know, metric of success We also know that when we get people in front of the app, and we get them in front of our story, at least conversion. We see us at the demo stage, like, just by checking out of a tool, people innate become interested. So we wanna show a little bit more of of what Mosaic is.

Client 2: And as Frodo mentioned in our meeting on Thursday, Improving the outbound win rate really is a key factor for...

Client 3: We know it for our funnel, but also just for investor perception. So Yeah. Huge initiative here and one that But we really wanted to get a kind of a fresh retrospective on to made a lot of incremental change we wanted to rip replace something a little bit more, you know, net new and best practice. As far as what's changed. So The deck is meant the prompt discovery. I think our our last generation was, but the previous ones for more kind explain our slides It still the or framework. So all that training and reinforcement we've done is totally relevant here. If anything it's emphasized in these slides so something that will help pull that out of us. It also helps pull our prospects out of the weeds and leans in a higher dollar pain. As we know our prospects and sometimes living the week. To spend, you know, forty other fifty hour working hours a week in the weeds. So anyway, we can get them thinking about bigger dollar problems be kind more strategic to the business is really, really critical and also something that's just a challenge to do because the again like, folks maybe all our time in in weeds. Another thing too is that I mean know, our motion is uniquely targeted to, like, reading out of their diary to quote the or lab framework, Like we Like, we just know there's probably four five, maybe six pain points that are always top of mind. And maybe I obviously flavor to it of around, you know, situation thoroughly. Generally like gonna come down to the points that we know around integration, sheet based planning, border porting modeling like, we week no. Probably ninety percent of what we're getting into on every call we get. So with that, it just made sense. Okay. We can probably get a deck it's a little more prescriptive and call this out more head on. And then does some of the mosaic excel and then still leads into that main discovery framework. So All those factors came together and I'll quickly walk through a new deck. I will be quick here because everyone a look at that video prior, but questions they're call so far? Cool. It's good good. We paul for new deck here to quickly talk through it. Okay. Second second monitor issues today. Makes this fun. Do you guys see this. Okay?

Host 1: Yep Perfect So I'll share just the slides.

Client 3: There is a script the company this, that you've all been set help.

Client 3: But Just wanna walk through a quick example here. I will be ann entertaining this because we're gonna do a role play I and I right after this. So the the certification asking you to do all kinda doing on the fly today. But just to quickly hit on the deck here. So First is an intro slide. We'll take a little bit of prep prior to put their logo on it. But again, I think it does speak to the fact that, like, we're not just turning burning our calls and there just another prospect financial to hook our sales funnel work. We're gonna be presenting this as a a legit presentation with their logo. Here, this slide is primarily calling out two key factors. One, finance teams are outnumbered. Certainly more than more than ever calling out in stat. These are these are supposed be stats, you know, hey It's one fine professional per a hundred. Full time employees. Great time to ask them about what their clients team looks like. Hopefully, you've done some digging on other stakeholders in the organization, so you can leverage that. And overall just digging in on just like, what is the state of the finance function? They may have executives that pitch in their process they they may be completely they're on. So We don't know how to speak to Mosaic at all must kinda a little bit about their finance game. The next challenge that client team's experience. Is they're taking on a ton of new challenges. It's not no longer just, you know, expensive for you. They're taking on Saas metrics, you can see that's bracket in case it's not relevant a certain business maybe you can pluck it sales forecasting, head account planning, i'm closing the books, and asking the prospect, like, hey, know, from your perspective, Where are you spending time on these areas? Is this, you know, resonate with with what you're prioritizing by you prioritizing so and so forth. There's. Integration. So obviously, here, we know very clearly that this is one the key challenges for our prospects. So definitely deserves its own slide. So just again, this is a stat, hey. We know on average, science teams are pointed out of several different systems. When you show this slide, you'll have already removed anything that's not relevant for them. So if you know there Quickbooks, you know, Gust and Salesforce shop, like, leave those, delete the others. Again, just to get more we're like, we're reading the page out or diary And ask them. Like hey, is this, you know, confirm is this your technology that you're pulling from. You know, is there any other systems that are relevant for you're pioneer reporting. Do you have multiple entities? So just kinda doing our quality checks on the integrations that they have. Keep in mind for an outbound deal. We oftentimes will not know. All of this or maybe no none. So it's okay to leave multiple on here still doing that discovery, but if we do know it, the S sdr and a good job getting that out or you have go ahead and just populate this with their relevant tech stack. Cool So here now is a is a chance. We kinda talked about some of the prerequisite pain and out here is where all. Really takes specs for our prospects and spreadsheets. So kinda calling it out. Like, hey, you guys have multiple systems little head count, a ton of different priorities And you know, naturally all this is getting done in a spreadsheet. Was never meant to be an integration tool this results in, you know, you guys really stuck in the weeds, and not providing strategic value to the business. Spending hours of time, aggregating data normalizing it and and, you know, you're no longer back in the organization. Yep. To confirm, is this where you're doing or planning and reporting? Can you tell me a little bit about, you know, what your model looks like today and maybe a little bit about your reporting process. So just high level, very high level here, but i kind of again. Really leaning into what we already know they're they're experiencing pain around. If you can't tell by this point in the presentation guys, like we may already have some really, really high value once that have been surfaced, I'm kind of going through it as far as how the slides are executed, but talk second in, like, when they be pain, like, where to dig them all that. So actually, at this point, we're gonna we're gonna shut down the slides. What we wanna to do now is kinda conduct our more typical discovery using the, you know, kinda impact framework. The reason why we shut down the slides is that if you just have slide up the whole time, prospects getting this kind of cadence of, like, wanting to see what's next and they're being maybe be short or brief and there sponsors, and we've already kind of done that a few times. So wanna shut it down and now dive into what we've learned. We validated there certain challenges. We know their technologies, We've kind of some of the storytelling around where their pants like we are. Now dig into it. Go about getting on those challenges that you called out, dive into the other areas of their process and maybe we have done that discovery yet. We don't know what that challenges is. Build that unique logo test, root cause, negative impact, desired outcomes. So that we're on framework that we all we all know well. It's a time to do that. Can with the slides off So now they're compelled to engage and not just to get to the next slide. I'll pause there because that's obviously, a very meaty part of the call that I just take like, five seconds. You guys me there so far.

Host 1: I have a question.

Client 3: Yes.

Host 1: So When we talk about outbound and, like, doing things Like, kind of frame it this way is that for people who have expressed to us that they just took the call based on the Sc sdr meeting or is it also, like, I mean, I feel like most of my outbound don't feel that different from inbound and they're just like, oh, yeah. I heard about you guys through something, or, you know, I know even if it is outbound and I feel like we already get, like, thirty minutes of content of talking a lot of the times in these calls and I love the dad. Like, I think it's a great improvement. From the deck that we're using now when the case that it called for, but especially like, time is a little bit of a worry for me. So is this like that vacation to use every single time, we have a meeting that's outbound, or is it k. One it's necessary and when people are not opening up to you. Because most of the time, they they're not, I think.

Client 3: Yeah. I'm Pho Leaandra. I wish I shared your perception that our outbound calls feel the same as inbound. I've definitely not sense that and that's think probably one of the primary reasons why I think we should kinda back for care about process. It but there's we jump back into the slides on the training here. Calling... I do called out specifically around, like, This is built for a prospect who feels like an outbound prospect where they have minimal knowledge of say like it might be what you called out. Like, they just had took a meeting or say the outreach was compelling, or they maybe took a quick look at the site. I don't really know lot of what we do. That's it's targeted for it definitely. I would still probably argue though that there's a lot of folks inbound also who it does apply to.

Client 3: You know, where they I mean, I had before where it's like, oh, you know, we submitted this three weeks ago. I we were just looking at tools. I kinda forgot what you guys were, if you could just start from scratch. That'd be great. It's like, okay. You're more like an outbound prospect as far as your level of knowledge. So Yeah. There will be a little bit of a time to apply one this is relevant, but Yeah. Let's say you do get an outbound prospect who's like, we a fully budgeted initiative here's our paying points, and, like, we we need to set up a demo Asap. And we're well familiar with the space. You know, Whatever colleague used my a previous company. It's like, okay. Maybe I can be quick through this. I'm not spending twenty five minutes in the in this deck on the call. So get into kind some of the the when to apply this, But fair call if not everyone fits in this box. Yeah.

Host 1: Yeah. I guess I'm... I I just wanna know if this is like a like a rule or like, a judgment call as far as, like, how how much to a t. We have to follow it. To make sure that we get in all the other, you know, questions that we wanna ask. Just like Yeah guard there. Yep.

Client 3: I quickly, we should keep you going the sick of time. But, yeah. There is not a mandate that you do this on every single call for every single prospect. I will say your outbound prospects, the ob overall majority, I would imagine Rf for this. And, like, I'd be shocked if that's not the case for each of us. I mean, maybe will have a day go by we're two disco, we weren't fit forward or something like that. But I would that highly that... Yeah. Most folks on the outbound side particularly would be a good fit for this. And this is built to not be overly descriptive. We're gonna train you guys, like a very prescriptive manner. Just because it's the only way to really provides structure here, but there isn't a little bit of argue of how you apply this we're doing discovery throughout this deck. So if you get a good pain point, continue to dig deeper. Leaandra let me finish up on the slides, and then when we show kind of the considerations, I think it'll address a lot of what you're calling out.

Client 3: But This is not like every call you guys go through this script, like, on the robotic way that I am right now there's obviously flexibility here to pay on the situation. Cool I guess a lot now is obviously getting people to open up and help them get to their strategic high level questions is key like to this but actually, probably the more important piece is just getting people excited about Jebediah, Like, especially in an outbound setting, we do you see that high drop off from stage one to stage two, and that is probably of a function of people not opening up to us, but guess is there's also a big element of people get on the call Just answered a bunch of questions for us.

Client 5: We don't really get that. I'm excited about Mosaic how well we know them. There's base and the problems they solve. So that's a really key that we don't really have today that like this dac now really moves the needle on in addition to opening people out. But a big part of it is getting the person excited about, Mosaic.

Client 3: Awesome. Let's keep moving. Well we'll jump into ton of content around what you guys are in there. Let's keep going here but take good time. Once we've done the discovery around their key pain points, what we'll do here when we show this slide, and i we're pulling up the slides back up it we'll say, hey, based on what you called out. You seem like you're in this maybe this time constraints bucket You know, you're spending a lot of time it blade data and called the reporting piece kind of being a little bit of a sticky point for you. But as you... And as you called out, you know, prospect, It's really the missed forecasts that are keeping up at night and where the biggest challenge is. And this something we can help, you know, alleviate I... And, like, ideally here we'll actually use a reference. So I'll I'll keep you in second time we are a little bit up against it here. Let's go and keep moving. And now we get to explain those. We've bucket them into a, you know, kind of a in the pyramid, we talked about proposed solutions. Now this is, I think a little more straightforward get to position mosaic, Well here you know, mo powers spine seems to drive your strategic value of the business. Integrate your systems reporting and planning, and they'll take it from us. You know, where the number one rated strategic client's platform on G two crap. As far as a little bit of kinda like, how we work got integrations here, pre built, know, direct Api integrations, no longer meeting... Technical skill sets or spending bunch of time aggregating date in your sheet, how would this change your process? Again, kinda getting more into the how on the analytics side, we provide hundred and fifty out of box saas metrics and the ability to customize own, what metrics are a top of mind for you. Wanna take to pull out together. What man, That looked like for you. On the planning side, kinda talking about it here, hey, well, I make a three statement reporting in forecast saying no more I'm gonna worry about data tying out. We probably either at this point, have some pain points to address specifically when we're positioning this here. And then and we'll actually stop here on this level go. Hey, I'll send this to you afterwards. There's some content on on our ratings and how we perform in the market. But let's shut this down and talk about next steps. Then you can stop sharing in the slack. So I said a lot let me jump back into the presentation and to kinda contextualize some things. Definitely relevant for the college that you all just mentioned. So Really to what George said, the goal is gonna prospect to a demo. We just convert at of very, very high clip when they're on a demonstration. So list to your point, like it makes like we get a little bit less discovery done on these calls. However, if we get to a demo. That is the primary goal of that On the demo, it may change your that here. And they change your intro on the demo a bit. If you've already done a lot of the mosaic story telling, like, maybe we don't need to do that again especially no new on the call, like, we could probably skip that portion and maybe do some of the discovery nuances in their planning reporting process that we didn't get to yet. And we don't know what expenses are complex for them where we don't know how they model top line. You know, specifically at Maybe now we can ask these instead of hitting with the mosaic story again. So we will have to think a little bit more tailored down the funnel as well. I already mentioned this, yeah, but taylor for outbound prospects, but some inbound prospects may be a fit. I think it's probably fair call is that maybe some outbound prospects would not be a fit for this already have a ton of mosaic knowledge or they came in really really educated. But still after you've done your discovery, probably good time that pull some slides and show them some value because as we know the just images and mosaic help. What I ran through very quickly here was obviously very, very generic. We didn't have a ton of data on the prospect kinda worked into it, but as you conduct this, you're gonna get value, you're gonna get context throughout the presentation and probably at different time depending on each call. So there is a little bit of an art of knowing. When to dive deeper, what's, you know, important to dig into whereas we're you continue your presentation. So, yeah. Definitely, keep that in mind, like, I think to your point Leaandra, like, you could have wildly different context once you're one or slides too deep with each of these. People. So keep that in my And then lastly, yeah. Some Nuance process carrier will likely have to wait. We don't need to know what the data quality is of their start mandates in Salesforce, if we know sales strategy Arr, we can pause there and then do that on, you know, identical call. I again, probably typical for what our competitors are doing. I'll pull out here. Just kinda alleviate some of those thoughts for are confused and kinda when to apply this or how to? Cool. Certifications. So We wanted an opportunity for everyone to get certified before the holidays as we mentioned. If we do this afterwards, it's just like, realistically they're not gonna take effect until a couple weeks into a January then have some value February, and then we're, like, half quarter it through. Without seeing the improved conversion. So We are gonna do the four of the holidays. Fully acknowledging that's a tough thing to slide in, but we just... It was option of moving way too fast or way too slow. So we're we're calling on the way too fast track this one zero one for this week, we will check in on this answer questions. You can do a quick dry run. We can pull up all the documents and kinda walk you guys they're to you additional help, but We will do checking this week during one on ones around it. And then also, we'll do the twenty minute role plays, which will be your certification. We'll skip the report bill we'll skip the schedule of next steps. And I do wanna keep it within that twenty minutes just because between prospects joining late scheduling, it's like, that's real how much and we have The passive grade will be centered more around the tech delivery than the oil framework, especially in a role play context or lu stuff can be super difficult to really do very effectively. This is more about, like, punchy execution of the deck and just knowing what pop tracks come at which points. And yeah, still making your own guys to be clear. This is not a script reading off of. This something that we do want your sales styles to, you know, to come out with But I think the the here will be very, very helpful for getting folks to that next call. Cool. I'll pause there questions on certification, Anything so far. I realize we are. Or through this guy let know if you call. Cool. Alright. I see housing on the line perfect. Hopefully the Wi F slug. are gonna do this live right now. So I'm going to basically take a stab of what weird certification would look like right now. And we are... I know, A does not know. This is all the L and I are on the hey Jericho, I do not know Abraham pain points. He has other contacts that I'm not gonna considering here. So this will be a real true live crack at it. And as a result, it's an outbound discovery calling may may be a little bit tough at times, but want to give you guys a live example prior to us all cutting out. I realize Should be recording this. George my record. So Yeah. Let me pull up my deck for Perfect. Let we pull my deck for an Next and we'll get going here. Alright. About you're good on that your side?

Client 4: Yeah. Can you guys hear me?

Client 3: Yep. We got you. Give me a second here. Oh see a chat Oh, Okay. Let's little in a second. Guys. See. Okay.

Host 1: Correct? Yep.

Client 6: Yeah.

Host 7: Yep. Yep.

Client 3: I'm trying to keep my notes on the screen for self feedback. So I i'm scrolling down notes feedback from myself, please do the same. We'll be done for you guys when you're certifying. So Definitely feel free forget feel like what Landed well, what wasn't natural? Maybe what fall outside the I know you guys will have it prior. Let's go ahead and dive in. Alright We've all the report bowl. We talked about the weather. I know about your kids, and let's get gone. So I'll you good to kinda get get rolling here on the presentation in the discussion today.

Client 4: Yeah. Sure.

Client 3: Awesome. So how we typically structure these calls is we'll learn a little bit about your business walk it through a quick trail to Mosaic, And then lot quick discussion around, maybe areas of particular have assist for you and where we could help out. And then we'll kinda tie things together for you to see if a demonstration makes sense for you. But is that the all good on your end?

Client 4: Yeah. Sounds good.

Client 3: Awesome. So first, I guess, you know, I know that my colleague Mark, kinda caught you with an email. I guess, first, what resonated about his outreach i think particular, you're hoping us get out of the call today?

Client 4: Yeah. You know, we just went through our first iteration of our annual planned and to be quite break with you is a complete mess. There's a lot of errors. There's lot of back and forth with the board. So it was kind of search Internet. Do my own company due diligence and across name and then got outreach Remarks. So figure I the call it's kind of time you out to be honest you. So... Yeah. That's right matt.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. So you got to check out our site anything that you poked around on there that was Got your idle.

Client 4: Not too much. You know, I was just staying up late one night and just kinda Google searching and came across your name, and your a couple things about port creation and and had to consolidate data. So Yep. Maybe it's a good time to come describe what next slide. So we're a data engineering automation platform. So we're heavily assessed B to b company, and we basically created a fabric architecture with an organization. So we do also have a a heavy service component. To that we're trying to look and and for those key metrics that we're gonna report the board with. And that was kind of one of our biggest, you know, pain point is going through this last annual.

Client 4: That was... It it was our first as well. So we we have a lot of license learned. And we're trying to put that process going board.

Client 3: Okay. Awesome. Yeah. Definitely time to dive into. But, yeah, follow you there. We lot customers where one of the primary use cases is that order reporting piece and Yeah. The the nature of what you're calling out i'm following it all the way and We'll definitely dive into that. Note on the service modeling piece. So Need maybe quickly walk you through a quick title over overview and kinda why those egg exists, and then we'll we'll keep on here. Really the first reason Out to your point around some of the tasks you have that are maybe a little bit overwhelming right now. One of the big reasons we see for that is that finance teams are just out outnumbered. There's on average one a hundred of the rest of the team. And also, they're being asked to take on just an longer number of responsibilities. You called out some of these key metric reporting. As well some of the modeling areas here. But I guess first on the finance team makeup, just you on the finance team. I saw there was you know, you guys have a Cfo there, but anyone else help out with these areas or the team look like right now?

Client 4: Yeah. So it's it's me doing a lot of that to shoot twentieth work that fp work, but we also have a controller in a sap county. That make up kind of the finance team along with their Cfo. But the Cfo if has tasked me to do a lot better planning when recording.

Client 3: Gotcha. Yeah. And you called out some key areas on the right inside that that are on your plate. Anything else you're resonating as far as particular areas emphasis for Anything else that's on your guys docket Yeah.

Client 4: Definitely head account reporting. I mean, we're we're about to grow with this raised star series a And so we have a huge plan to of growth for next year. Given where we're ad currently. So head company planning for sure it's definitely top of my breast.

Client 3: You Yeah. Definitely fine. Yeah. Glad you guys are despite recent headwind, that's some cool things about what you guys are doing over there, But Awesome. Yeah. We'll, make sure doug found your head account went process here in a moment.

Client 4: I question on that sound metrics. Do you guys just do Sas match shift is there other metrics that you do that are potentially non task because we're kind of this we're not Pure saas business. So Go here sir.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. So we have Saas metric reporting is one of the big things we help out, but also financial metrics, operational reporting, And we have a a tool... A function tool, I should say that i allows you to any custom metrics for the business. So anything particular, top mind for you there?

Client 4: Yes. So sometimes we track on the services side like, utilization on our Cs in our implementation architecture So wondering if you kinda have some of those like, a head count type of metrics.

Client 3: Cool. Yeah. So something we can talk about customizing for you guys. Let's let's keep moving here. And I'll keep that in mind when we're talking about things to show you on the demo. Awesome. One of the other areas, we haven't discussed what your process cell and that we definitely see by am struggling by team struggling with is that they're on average one data from seven different systems. And typically, it's manually drawing into a sheet and just doing all that manual data aggregation. Curious. I know you guys are using Quickbooks Salesforce in Gust from Email with Mark. Thanks sharing that. Any other systems though there top of mind for and maybe drive any meaningful reporting or modeling for you?

Client 4: Yeah. We also use Stripe. For a billing So that's one thing. But we do. It's still honesty in that city we're still work through that process. But that's something that potentially will play a bigger role in the company know quarters.

Client 3: Awesome. Yeah. We do agree with stripe directly. So something we can we can plug into. And do you guys have just one And the on Next slide are you guys managing on multiple Quickbooks instances for any reason?

Client 4: Now right now it's just one one instance, just Us based only so straightforward over there. Yep.

Client 3: Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. So the way our integrations work is they're all direct plugin out of the box know need to, you know, write any custom language share or need a technical skill set and all this will flow in the app automatically. But let's keep moving here as far as the inevitable next step in your process is is bring all that data we discussed into a sheet. I guess first, you are managing your planning and reporting on on sheets. Is that right? Or like, what is that? That process look like right now.

Client 4: Yeah. Very... I mean, exactly these images on air, but probably, you know, twenty more tabs, a ton of formulas because we're not just dumping data out of Quickbooks. In Salesforce to get these metrics, but we're also applying different forecast methodologies create kind of that plan that budget. Yeah.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm I'm pho. Natalie smalls, maybe even some five here on the screen. But yeah. Really, what we've seen. And as as you know, itself not meant to be a integration layer. And if all responsibilities weren't enough. I mean, it's now one of the only stakeholders in the business where you haven't had a bunch of, you know, software come in and help you out. That's something that as important that is driving, you know, key results. I actually work with the customer who I I probably shouldn't name given this challenge, but we worked with them and by automating the integration aspect of their planning. We determined there was, like, a about one million dollar error and how they were forecast in the Arr arr. As a result, obviously, had massive impact on the business and they realize that their primary function should probably be score keeping at that point. But by getting mosaic, are able to alleviate that challenge. So hope something we can streamline remind this process for you here. And then just to kinda quickly discussed it more thoroughly out, I think you're kinda following here on a little bit about why Mosaic exists. You call out a couple challenges. You called out first, the kinda board reporting piece and some of the the challenges there. I guess first, you know, like, it didn't got your primary challenge you'd say that you're... That you're maybe that's keeping up at night is that that border piece. You called out data errors and some other areas along those lines. Say bad or anything else that you'd say is more top of mind for you.

Client 4: I mean, we're just a small team. So getting the data to current state of reporting, is just very hard to do. Working with those systems, gust Salesforce. Quickbooks getting that together takes a long time. It takes a lot of effort then the constantly the board asking kind of questions, You've been just like trying to figure out scenario modeling and saying okay.

Client 4: Well if we run this way, what is impacts the cash? Do we need to take out like, a debt revolver or have a bridge round of of funding given, like, our current cash balance, you know, a year out from now. I think that's the part that's missing, and we can't even get there to be honest with you. Just to let alone create a plan from scratch. And then think on top of that, just like, getting the business to engage with us more and understanding their spend. And how do we go and provide guidance to them as well it's just it's kind of a nightmare to be honest.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. You called out scenario modeling and the the kinda the cash forecasting piece. And then the similar kind of the burns side on the collaboration around expenses Is it safe to say that, you know, like, most businesses, you guys are kinda viewing that you know, cash forecast piece as as kind of a primary outcome of all these areas we discussed is right? Know, bigger North star for you right now.

Client 4: Honestly, I think it's just cash. To be honest. Yeah.

Client 3: Absolute. I mean, yeah. You've called out data errors as well. I mean, is it something where you're a hundred percent confident that the date of the model's is accurate or is there it's maybe a potential chance that you guys are looking at you know, a little bit blinded when you're going up for your investors.

Client 4: Yeah. I mean, we we we got you know, just a week could ago. We we caught up a pretty big error on our revenue calculation that we had a fixed like, spend a couple hours the the formulas Excel. So no that's definitely top of mind you know, to ensure that that trust from like an advisory perspective still act right?

Client 3: What was the the nature of that air exactly like, what where does that come from?

Client 4: So we we were trying to calculate Arr So the way it works is, you know, looking at I'm rolling twelve months. Then calculating that in your future, not just historical and layering in both from a natural checked about our forecast. And so we caught an error on the forecasting side. Because our actual are kind of like, it is what it is. But that's where we kinda had that missing of calculation from like an error perspective. Pretty embarrassing actually. One of our members core members call it out currently.

Client 3: Oh, wow. Okay. I mean, what would be the impact you'd say if that problem persists, like, if you guys had another issue, let's say the next, you know, cycle with the board, Like, how that impact the business you think?

Client 4: I think just you know, not being seen as a good trusted adviser. Is is I think the biggest thing that keeps me up at night. As well as just having a a an accurate forecast you know, when someone is giving you millions of dollars of their money. They're expecting, you know, a hundred percent confidence in numbers that you're guitar them in terms of the forecast. So in Embarrassing.

Client 4: No. There's a an narrowing in any of that forecast. Right?

Client 3: Yeah. And absolutely. I guess what what solutions have you guys looked that? You mentioned just poke right on Toll around on, like, playing tools quickly, but other solutions you guys have tried to implement or else you've done delivery the problem.

Client 4: But we looked that. We're look... I looked at a couple of i think it's like Giraffe, I think or something, there's, like a something that in a queue I believe as well. And then Athena, Thanks.

Client 3: Yep. Got it. Okay. So you you're just...

Client 3: At. Okay.

Client 4: Yeah. Actually, carry out curious in that on those slides, it's it's think it showed like an excel ascension like the Google sheet. Are you so you guys like, integrate with like your your google sheet or excel? So at work, sir.

Client 3: Yeah. So we'll plug into those source systems we touched on like Quickbooks salesforce, stripe and Gust for you. On the sheet side, we do... We are inter with shoot. So whether that's an upload or an export. Across the application something we can definitely scope out for you. But, yeah, we are inter with sheets And that way, it won't be an integration, but typically, the the upload piece for whatever model, you may need that something that's possible, Where they probably wouldn't relevant you're used since we're plugging in directly. I'm familiar with Giraffe, Cuban Hamilton. These are solutions that really bring some automation to your spreadsheet, but I think we're a little far a fall short in in your use cases. Is that because they are entirely chic based, still is a little bit of that nature to that. And when we're talking about prone maybe forecasting being something that could be a blocker for you guys raise that next round or on front your investors. Is that may be something that That would be a little bit more cautious towards. But, you know, still maybe good tools for a small organization looking for. Just like automation on a on a spreadsheet based tool. But we'll definitely go very thorough and where we compare against something we show you the the application. But I do appreciate you being kind of, you know, insightful on your processing and where you have the challenges. Looks like you guys are kinda looking at planning solutions, you know, first and foremost. But before I get into kind of explaining Mo to you and had nuts bolts of how we work But what the ideal planning to look like for you curious, you know, what that ideal system they look like.

Client 4: Yeah. I think automation across like, Quickbooks Salesforce, custom to automatic reporting, a consistency, right, with the reporting. You know, you ask mh what the Arr is at an point of time? Could be different if you're asking, like, someone else with the company Right? So I'm providing that consistency and and the accuracy, I think and the automatic fashion would be most deal state.

Client 3: Okay. Well good to know. I I guess question before I get in back into Mosaic is around the the team you kind of call out and other team members that are involved here, but anyone else impacted by the problem. Anyone else you think about how can impact the business. You think would make sense to maybe you loop into our Next call.

Client 4: Definitely definitely the controller see does a lot of the actual reporting more of the budget versus actual but he he reports on a monthly cadence natural. So that might be definitely relevant. I think for now the Cfo we may wanna hold off until we see that initial demo to see, like, what you know, what the capabilities are and if they're a good bet or kind send it. Okay.

Client 3: Okay. Cool. Not good to know. Yeah. I definitely think you called out around the cache we in top of mind, that make sense to loop in the rest of your folks, but we'll okay moving here? You can see this slide here again, Okay?

Client 4: Yeah. Mh.

Client 3: Yeah. Well, this time what we like to show this slide for is that it does a good job of kinda categorizing where our finance teams are. From being more tactical to more strategic and where those those challenges lie. Really, you've called out some things that are at the very top of the the pyramid here around mis forecast and, you know, overall not represent representative the business accurately to your investors. And then you called out kind of for current solutions you were looking at maybe expensive legacy solution. So that's where we see a lot of the you know, our our strategic folks. Kinda looking for solutions as more based plugins like you mentioned. And we'll get into a little bit of hear about about why we differ. But just like to show this that there's really... Mosaic is trying to take you out this pyramid. It looks like although you're at the top. You know, hopefully, we can save you from bringing out one of those more been talking them from my enterprise tools. But as far as the mo kinda how we work also As you can see there, you know, we are gonna be a more app native. We're not gonna live on your spreadsheet with other system that you called out. Goal is to get you to drive strategic decisions overall, again, streamlining data from all your core systems, automate automating the reporting and planning process and getting you largely out of sheets But don't take it from us. You know, we the number one g two tool for strategic clients out there. So something that I I do feel like here some alignment. How we can help you out. Integrations. So we've already touching this a little bit because one of the key challenges that you called out is on the integration side, but I think here of a message short is that data will tie out no more having to show up to the board with every rowan column comes through knowing that the slightest Enrique and impact your next round. Plug in directly here and ensure data is accurate. Curious what having live integration sawyer source systems. I think i'm move to move the needle for you with it. You sleep better or get more done, curious of that would that change process?

Client 4: Yeah. Definitely. I mean, I'd like that. Pyramid thing, where you you're trying to get to that that end state, and I think that's the ultimate goal on the purse person it is just getting that data ring, you know, that that that come obsolete so in that sense and then and integrated an automatic fashion, so definitely Yep.

Client 3: Absolutely. And then, you know, one thing one of the key we help out with we a little bit forties on the metric reporting you to call out some that were top of mind. So overall here, the goal is again, just ensuring accuracy. You've already called out a lot of metric that are top of mind for you. But, you know, curious, how much time of of your workflow spent on the reporting piece, versus maybe other areas.

Client 4: Reporting, gosh. I I don't know. I think for example, last week, we've spent probably fifteen hours building, you know, the b two of our board presentation we beat did the first round with their Cfo and the exact team and we had to go back and do rework a bunch of things. So just to give you for a sense scale there.

Client 3: Yeah. Absolutely. And I'm funny. You have do all the hard on the calculations, and then we're still coming all the data to ensure it's accurate, we're not missing those figures in front of the investors. So phone all the way. And on the the modeling side, so really mosaic and then modern solution for forecasting head count, expenses, top line, your balance sheet, and your cash forecasting piece. You call out that cash forecast and head count planning, definitely be in top of mind. Something that we can we can absolutely help out with. But any other call on your planning process That's relevant for?

Client 4: ...just an scenario planning, you know, given that lessons are our on our first board meeting being having that flexibility to to create multiple, like, a bull case and most likely, and present a timely way versus us going back and reworking numbers and all of our spreadsheets. I think would be like a huge one for the board and for our exec team.

Client 3: Yeah. Yeah. I'm following it pretty much applying the she based challenges by however many scenarios you're managing and all the nature of that. So That'd me something we can assist with our scenario planning module. Allows you to essentially, you know, duplicate those models, link them together But without again, having that data discrepancy Be a challenge for you. So something we can it on in our for For length. I'll go ahead and stop sharing here. I know we're up against time a little bit but I'll I will send this your way and has some call outs around our system. And kinda where we've been rewarded. It's usually around things of, you know, ease of use, you know, good data accuracy, and kinda plug and play scenario modeling. So it doesn't align a little bit with what you're calling out. So I'll send this to you out. But I'll kind thoughts you now Questions on your end, Anything we maybe missed the mark on that was for you.

Client 4: No. Think that's good. Cool.

Client 3: Alright. Well, pause there. I would've got stuck my now into trying to get him into the next call. Try to get the demo booked. I would have position it against his pain that we learned. Was a fun one out coming out my toes with some competitor rejections, and I feel like that was a real role play mine.

Client 3: I'm lawyer sweating But i'll pause on feedback for myself.

Client 3: I have a ton of feedback out scribble down, particularly on the the pyramid slide. I feel like I was almost like so open that I was having trouble finding, like, new value on that pyramid slide, but Yeah. I'll go and pause questions feedback, thoughts, tell your part if you'd like.

Client 4: I'll I'll give my perspective on just, like, they haven't seen anything and just doing this like, yeah, scratch. I do feel besides the beginning sides or are awesome as I when I kinda don't know too much about Mosaic. It does kind of come up as like, we an extension tool. To be honest because there's a lot of those Excel, like, the first two sides I think you showed. There's an Excel like images and stuff. I'm like, in my head already like, oh, it's like, an extension or whatever. So clarifying there would be better I think honestly, what resonated the most was that pyramid? After you've got me to talk about some of my pains, and then you pulled up that side made me feel like you're an adviser you're giving me, like, a perspective of like my challenges. Which I think out of all the side, that was, like, one of the the best way to, like, summarize it and to, like, recap on what I was basically to spewing out upwards. Right? My perspective.

Client 3: Yeah. It's a good point on, like, maybe not really knowing how those egg works before we start talking pain points could put you a little bit. Thinking that we're in a different sphere. I guess you were in this context looking at or she pays toll stuff a good point on just like, maybe the Mosaic story or intro, could use a little more there. The pyramid slide, I mean, honestly, one of the primary functions for it is when folks are helpful. I think you were pretty helpful on this call over we're billing pain pinpoint that it's kind of a way to like prime more of those high dollar dollar pain out of that. Because I felt like we landed at least some of the high dollar pains that I was kind of more so what you already told me, but I still think it was in a way helpful on the strategic you know messaging around getting out of the tactical areas. But got note at least resonates from your perspective because I think was a tough for me to deliver, but you did because you were so helpful. Otherwise, other feedback?

Client 2: I I I agree with that point. Because I feel like Kirk wrong, the goal of the basically, discovery prompt, the deck that we've created. Is to get them to put their guard down a little bit, like, make sure that we understand what their world is. And yeah, Just echoing Hours point, I think it does a really strong job on that first part of it and it's like, okay. Like, these guys do know what we're talking about, here the challenges that we're facing. And then wrapping up on that pyramid slide, leads to a pretty good discovery transition where then, like, we're talking through what their actual pain points are. That's always the toughest as part is just getting them to talk to get one or two pain points, because once we have one two pain points, then we can start going down that just like, you know, question, day problem, elaborate right on problem. Tie up the problem move on to the next one, and that takes, like, four or five minutes per issue. So once we get there, I feel like then it kinda gets into a little bit more natural of conversation. Which I think the slides are really good at, but then if we go too far beyond it, then maybe we aren't, like, digging in to the pain points that they've given us enough and then maybe it's, like, oh, we don't really like listening as much making Them kinda sit through a deck presentation.

Client 2: Think so good big fan of the first half of the the deck share.

Client 3: Yeah. It's good be feedback. I definitely felt like it was a little bit because probably I was leading to the discovery framework more heavily like, when I was speaking some of those audio slides that like it was a little bit du, but probably good example to what Leaandra called out of like, hey, maybe really helpful on the discovery side. We do a lot of good digging. And maybe we spend less time on those slide. They not reiterating about questions by modeling if they just told me all the pain points. Like, pretty good feedback. I still wanted to kinda represent a little bit about what that flow looks like, but I would say way that Owl conducted himself as a prospects. Probably, yeah. Was a little bit too lengthy on those areas where we already had that good pain point.

Client 3: But Yeah. The learnings are for sure.

Client 2: And then one one other one, just from like that little you know, kinda like quick quick plug for the latest Linkedin friend I found. Just for chatting through, like, the framework of getting other people involved, just being a little bit more appreciated prescriptive given that sales process. Of just saying, like, hey. Typically, you know, we're seeing like, controllers have a lot of issues like, cleaning up the books and, like, getting accrual set up you know, we're seeing Ceos unable to get actionable insights into x y and z and we're seeing, you know, like, your Cfo is able to spend time on, like, scenario modeling and Here's How Zag able to impact them. Like, do you think it would be good for them to be involved So then we give them like, a little bit more of a reason. Upfront. Too. So I just...

Client 3: That just reminds you're kinda talking about that next steps.

Client 2: Set up. It. Cool.

Client 3: I'm writing down some feedback from this. It's definitely good consideration around probably positioning a little bit of mosaic maybe earlier around how we're different. And then also the later slide being redundant if we've already done good kind of positioning or good discovery. So I'll keep that in mind for when we're doing our certifications for you guys. I think it is a good blessing because we'll have folks who do that. If I is a little more guarded or just had less pain points or what it's probably more typical an outbound prospect, like those sides may have made sense, but I'm following you guys couldn't make sense to turn those down. So get my thoughts going on this. You guys have all the materials here. So think we've seen how it's like a template that can be flexible in different scenarios. Still some improvement needed on my side for sure. And we'll hopefully transfer that to you guys during the one zero one's this week. Thoughts questions concerns, more feedback.

Client 5: Yeah. I just might say it definitely lot the deck or the deck should line up. Pretty well with our discovery framework. So one thing that would probably like, the helpful everyone is actually go back and especially watching you know, part three and maybe four of like the locked training and then, like being able to tie it to your specific parts of the deck. But I, hopefully, really build out, like how it ties together. And then especially that bonus video, people haven't watched the yet just on the discovery prompt. Super value bowl for, like, well set up like what we're trying to do. And I think like, interestingly, the second half of the deck is around what the products or what our product actually does. Definitely is du. And that is a little bit on purpose because, like, that is a point that it's to map to desired outcomes. So like, you're supposed to everything in there is now supposed to be edited with something they said. So now like, this is a part where you're parrot back to them. Like their desired outcome and how are so we should actually solve their desired outcome. So I think that piece is maybe like you probably spent the least amount time on that, I'd say, during my whole discovery framework rollout loud. We've spent a lot of time I'm like, the pain building and getting to that like big dollar problem. I don't think we spend like, a ton of time around that desired outcome and, like, matching up what they said with like what we do. So that could be like another big step up Like be just can add using this frame by using this deck. So probably another good one. Let's be helpful and gonna refresh her on it's like, how Colombo i'll kinda wait out that desired outcome flow. Because you and then maybe, like, the repetitive is actually a positive, rather than maybe just feeling like stagnant.

Client 3: I personally. Yeah. It's a good point. You know, probably repetitive for us. We live breathe this all day. That's probably a good call out there. But, yeah There is a little bit of more nuance has to how positions that against their desired outcome, which I probably got a rip woven in. But It's a good call, I guess, in a way that is by intention. Sorry. Let's go ahead.

Host 1: This honestly seems like a great deck also that when sdr are prospecting to, like, shorten it and send it out because it pretty much addresses, like, hey, this is what you're dealing with. Here's what we do. And, like, my interest have in taking a discovery call? Obviously, it... We're not maybe so obviously, but it did feel like a lot of talking. So, like, I know our our golden rules like thirty seventy. Are we adjusting that when we use... I just... I wanna know, like, how much should we be talking? Obviously, we're presenting. So we're be talking more but what would be like, a good ratio to get in what we wanna get in.

Client 3: Yeah. I can jump in there. I would say, thirty seventy is pretty gnarly, I've never heard of that as... I, that's ideal, then I don't think anyone of us have been doing that? That's that'd be pretty impressive. I think those seventy prospects use ones that speak so long. They ruin our discovery calls. Because they gone huge tangent I've typically seen our call be around, like, sixty forty more so even like fifty fifty. We're not that that this is a little bit more... speaking. I think we think about ways to like, tailor our sales process to what we know and about our data is that we just know that when we do more telling about Mosaic like in our demos, it just converts like our approach is unique enough. It does stand out. It's, you know, visually easy to understand. Part of I think is a little bit by design. And part, i probably also too me feedback for myself here where I introduce more discovery, But, yeah, I would say this is probably a clarification that this uptick are talk ratio. I certainly one of wouldn't want it be seventy thirty, like, in the other direction. But something we can get data on is we start to implement it. But I think it is a little bit by design as we know. The app itself self. I mean, I... It's more than what I've seen to show the images and preaching the story resonates cell probably i designer her too. Yeah. We'll get data on that for sure. Once you implement us will know exactly how the top ratio is low. Have a good. Cool. We'll cut out here guys. Let's start our pipeline sync. In five minutes end to give you guys call it seven minutes to to reset And then yeah, I'll jump into pipeline, one zero one will check on this. Please review this maybe before the end the day just to kind brush it up while it's warm in your minds and then We'll hit it on it throughout the week. I'll shut down now, but Thanks, guys.
